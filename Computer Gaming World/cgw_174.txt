"Bad Moon Rising A Primer on PC Game Industry Myopia FLD TOUR LA marketing minions in the console world have to learn the old lessons anew. Lessons that the PC game market has never learned. There have been enough lamentations in this column about the lack of a stable platform and the L implications of that lack upon easeof-use, so I'll avoid that rant. a wants to get the product \"out of here!\" Console makers build in a definite QA time and actually have gamers play the games in order to get an idea of play balance. How long has it been since you felt that game had been \"play balanced\" prior to shipping? The most important secret to Nintendo's (and later, Sega's, and later, Sony's) success was inventory control. There was a time when I as a free-market advocate, sneered at the monopolistic control of the market by the console manufacturers as repressive. Yet I know this much: They would never have placed 3,700+ titles on the market (as PC game publishers did in 1998; see the article on holiday drop the retail price of the machine as long as they could produce it more cheaply. This would allow more machines to penetrate the mass market as the prices (as well as costs) dropped. In the PC game world, we keep seeing development budgets rise and retail costs drop. As it is, retailers are selling at nearzero profit and making their money from cooperative advertising and gimmicks. Where is the incentive for quality if the retailers make their money with or without a sale? The ex-preacher in me wants to say, \"Broad is the way that leadeth unto destruction\" when I see the pathetic situation at retail. Nintendo used aggressive marketing. It understood that its brand he year was 1985. The Atari 2600 generation was dead, its only eulogy an incredible urban legend of E.T. cartridges buried in an Arizona landfill. PC game publishers were scrambling for money to put out a few meager titles, and CEOs from game publishers laughed loudly at the new 8-bit game machine from a playing card company in Japan. \"Don't they know that the home gamemachine market is dead?\" smirked one such CEO (no longer in our business) at a Consumer Electronics Show when Nintendo unveiled its first entertainment system. But the last laugh was on the PC game industry, as well as on the retailers that laughed at Nintendo's initial contacts. Before the 8-bit days were over, Nintendo of America sold 30 million NES systems, making it the most popular video game system ever. Nintendo won the battle for young. ster's hearts with a combination punch that included: a) ease of use, b) quality control standards, c) market inventory control, d) controlled price devaluation, and e) aggressive marketing. The PC game industry has grown (in terms of revenue earned, titles offered, and units sold) over the years, but has never had the phenomenal success experienced by Nintendo in the 8-bit market, Sega in the 16-bit market, and Sony in the 32-bit market. It seems like each time around, the merry Broad is the way that leadeth unto destruction. — Gaming Messiah However, the second point is some what related to that issue. It's difficult to have bug-free software with out a standard machine to run that software on. That standard machine does not exist in the PC world, no matter what Mr. Gates' hucksters try to sell us. Yet we could and should leam a lesson from the console world's quality assurance efforts. Too often, our development teams in the PC world work past the time when a program was scheduled to be mastered, and the product testing is conducted in a frenzied rush because the producer glut in last month's Read. Me). In fact, you could always tell when a console machine was reaching its last legs because the manufacturers would increase the allotment of titles allowed to each licensee. In the PC world, we claim that we can regulate ourselves, and every year we promise that we'll do fewer and better titles. And every year, the number of titles offered goes up. This means, inevitably, less retail shelf space as titles push and shove for attention; less marketing/advertising money per title as they attempt to get your attention; and (the spirit of a previous point) less time for shaking down and fine-tuning individual products. If I had a dollar for every time I've heard someone say, \"We're going to make fewer, but higher quality products,\" i'd be able to upgrade my computer annually without working. In the console world, manufacturers knew they could continually was a powerful weapon in fighting the shelf wars and it made certain that the products it released wouldn't ding the brand. In the PC world, we simply attempt to create branding on the fly. Put out a few Clunkers? Change the name of the publisher. Botch the first release? Put up a patch or promise to get it right in the sequel/gold/special edition. The Big N guys understood that lousy products meant a lousy reputation. The PC game guys tend to think their customers suffer from amnesia. from the vantage point of a long-time (some say too-long) editor in this business, I think the PC game market is the closest to the Atari experience of 1984 that we've ever been. We're overleveraged, understimulated, and oversated. If we don't start learning the lessons of sales curve past, 1999 is (in the ill-fated vernacular of Yogi Berra) going to look like déjà vu all over again.

"What Rocks, What Bites A Look at the Good and Bad in Gaming: 1998 Edition his time last year I gave awards in this column celebrating the best and worst of the year's gaming trends. Since the column was focused on sims (I've since been unleashed on the entire industry by the powers that be at CGW), the awards were named after the superb F-15 Eagle and the anemic Brewster Buffalo. Those aren't really appropriate for more general lauds and criticisms, though, and resisted Thierry \"Scooter\" Nguyen's suggestion to label trends as \"Da Bomb\" and \"Hella Gimpy.\" So without further ado, let's look at 1998's utilitarianly named Gaming Ups and Gaming Downs. Kudos to AMD for the K6-2 processor with 3DNow! technology, which offers Pentium IIlevel performance for Socket 7 computers. I wouldn't actually choose the processor myself (1 put in my decade as an Amiga user-I'm allowed to be mainstream now), but you can be sure that the great prices on Pentium Il and Celeron systems are more due to the competition from the likes of AMD than to any generosity on Intel's part. The drop in system prices is a mixed \"Up.\" It's great that we can buy top-of-the-line gaming Gaming Downs The biggest bummers of 1998 were when great games didn't sell in a market in which some utter crap has posted huge numbers. BATTLEZONE and F22 ADF are prime examples. BATTLEZONEwhich got a five-star CGW review-sold about one-tenth the number of copies that DEER HUNTER sold. C'mon, there's 300,000 of you reading this. Let's all go buy copies of BATTLEZONE right now. Put down the mag and make a statement about good games. (And no, I'm not on Activision's payroll. You're thinking of Jeff Green.) Another downer was the licensing frenzy around ancient arcade titles. BATTLEZONE might have sold better if it hadn't been saddled with the moniker of a dusty old arcade game that most of us grew bored with after about five quarters. Jeers to Intel for doing its best to defeat overclocking by powerbetween the OpenGL and DirectX camps have petered out, but the fact remains that novice gamers are still faced with games supporting various combos of Direct3D, OpenGL, and 3Dfx Glide. Hey Microsoft-why not add a \"plugin\" architecture to DirectX6 that would allow companies like 3Dfx to add new 3D features without waiting for a major DirectX revision? Then we could put proprietary APIs to bed once and for all Four million bucks spent on DOMINION: STORM OVER GIFT 3our industry's equivalent to the $40 million poured into Ken Starr's foray into erotica writing. Just think-Ion Storm could have spent that money sprucing up their facilities (maybe they could use another row of $4,000 seats for their THXequipped in-office theater). The obligatory flame goes out to every company that released a game that needed patches to be good. How many gamers will never know that RAINBOW SIX, iF/A-18, Finish the games, then ship them. This trend could kill our industry. Gaming Ups One trend that hasn't gotten much attention but which deserves appreciation is the upsurge in mission editors being included with games. Special kudos to Activision for including the actual mission development tools for games like BATTLEZONE on game CDs. Even if you don't want to create your own missions, these editors mean you'll find a wealth of extended game play opportunities on the Net. Similarly, applause to Microsoft and Activision/Parsoft for making the formats for their planes available. We're looking forward to a wealth of cool add-on planes for COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR and FIGHTER SQUADRON. Wonderful gaming experiences-and huge crowds-were found on Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone, Jane's Combat.Net, and Blizzard's battle.net. We're happy to see services like Gamestorm adopt more realistic pricing models ($9.99/month is a killer deal for what it offers), but the mass-market future is with the companies who offer free play and make their money off selling boxed games or online advertising, PCs for under $2,000 now, and that the surge in power will make for even more impressive games. But that has to be frustrating to folks who've found their Pentium 233MMX systems to be already on the anemic side. A surprising Up was Windows 98. Sure, the upgrade was unnecessary for most Win 95 users. But after spending a few months with the operating system, I've been very impressed with its stability and ease of (re)installation. Finally, cheers to the developers of HALF-LIFE and RAINBOW SIX, who showed us that 3D shooters can be about more than fast reflexes and cool lighting effects. users in its latest Celeron and Pentium Il revisions. While we're happy that unknowing consumers won't be as easily taken by dealerremarked processors, we're sad to see savvy users prevented from getting extra game performance out of their systems. If this really is to protect consumers and not just a marketing decision, how come almost every user who tried to overclock a Celeron 266MHz to run at 400MHz (or even at 448MHz) was successful? The conspiratorially inclined might suspect that processors are being underclocked by Intel for marketing purposes. Another downer was the 3D API confusion. The heated exchanges and M1 TANK PLATOON II ended up being good gaming experiences? Finish the games, then ship them. This trend could kill our industry. Raspberries to the developers of every DOS game released in 1998. DOS is dead, Jim. Move on. the biggest downer of the year was Dani Bunten Berry passing on. She was a talent who ranked right up with Sid Meier. Her M.U.L.E. and SEVEN CITIES OF GOLD helped keep me sane in college. She practically invented multiplayer gaming.

"Played a Good Book Lately? BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES Is a PC Page-turner While that game garnered critical acclaim it was CGW's adventure game of the year in 1996HAVE NO MOUTH bombed at the box office. audience for these products must be the juvenile market, the products themselves suffer from being dumbed down. One would think, however, that mysteries and thrillers wouldn't have this problem since the audiences for these stories range from young adult and upward. However, the only game of significance based on a literary work in the past few years was I HAVE NO MOUTH AND I MUST SCREAM. here are few things in life more satisfying than curl ing up next to a fireplace with a cat in your lap, a bowl of fresh Cheez-Its at your side, and a really good book. If you spend as much time on planes and trains as I do, you find other ways to enjoy your favorite authors. Listening to William Gibson read Neuromancer on tape once helped me through a particularly turbulent East Coast flight. And the late Roger Zelazny's recital of A Night in the Lonesome October is as close to the consummate Halloween entertainment as you're likely to find this side of Bela Lugosi's ghost. But one way I've rarely been able to enjoy my favorite books is when they've been translated into games. Part of this is a lack of vision on the part of game producers: The same sort of get-thelicense-first thinking that gives us bad Batman movies also gives us bad Spider-Man games. Because the people in charge think the Legend in the Making Help is finally on the way. Legend Entertainment has teamed with horror novelist John Saul to do a game based on the author's best-selling The Blackstone Chronicles, which should be available about the time you read this. One of the reasons that THE BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES fares bet ter than attempts by other highpowered authors (such as Michael Crichton's somnambulistic AMAZON) is that the game was developed essentially as an additional novel in the series-much like Raymond Feist's BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR (Dynamix, 1993). needless abstractions of games like THE 11TH HOUR. As you journey through your father's asylum-now converted to a museum-you're confronted by the horrors perpetrated by your father in the name of psychological research. The more facts you discover, the more you must deal with his legacy as well as your own unsavory past. Moreover, you can never be really sure exactly how much is real and how much is your imagination: Can this really be your father's ghost speaking to you? Is your son actually in danger? Did you somehow help put him there? Aside from the whodunit aspects of the game, BLACKSTONE is particularly powerful in its depiction of psychological treatments. For example, it's one thing to read about some random individual undergoing electroshock therapy. BLACKSTONE's puzzles derive naturally from the plot line, a refreshing change from games like THE 11TH HOUR. bad Spider-Man games. Because The RIVEN crowd will swoon over BLACK STONE's sumptuous graphics, courtesy of Presto Studios (THE JOURNEYMAN PROJECT series), and game starved fans of traditional adventures will enjoy the tightly woven and atmospheric story. which at times struck me as even more enjoyable than the books. What impresses me most is that the puzzles—the heart of any adventure gamederive naturally from the plot line, a refreshing change from the It's quite another to have your character strapped into a chair during the game, trying to find a way out as the clock ticks down to the initiation of flowing current. It's the pacing of the game sometimes thoughtful then switching to stark immediacy-that makes BLACKSTONE work as a PC thriller. As adventure games try to reinvent themselves in the postMYST era, this is one game that can really appeal to both mainstream and core audiences. My hat's off to Legend and to Mindscape for publishing this one. Maybe one of these days we'll be able to argue whether A TALE OF TWO CITIES for Windows 2001 is better than Super-DVD FAHRENHEIT 451. We can only hope. CGW WELCOME HOME, SANITARIUM BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES is every bit as beautiful as MYST, and it's worlds beyond it in gameplay. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Otherwise, from the Start Menu in Windows 95 and type D:\\RUN-ME (where D is the letter of your CD-ROM drive) to run it straight from the CD. You may type D:\\INSTALL to create a CGW program group on your Windows desktop for future fun. Many demos require the disc to be in the CD-ROM drive in order to run; therefore, we recommend installing the demos from our disc. 012100),100120 0211003 To Get the CD-ROM To subscribe to the CD-ROM version of the magazine, call (303) 665-8930. If you already receive the magazine without the CD, you must wait until your current subscription expires before receiving the CD version. Please address subscription complaints to cgw@neodata.com. Neodata is a magazine fulfillment house that is not owned or operated by Ziff-Davis. nighter jocks are in for a treat this month. We bring you an exclusive demo of the CG-Choice winning TOTAL AIR WAR. Get a taste of a real dynamic campaign as you try to secure the Sudanese border in less than 12 hours. If your tastes run more toward classical planes, then fire up the JANE'S WORLD WAR II FIGHTERS demo. You'll get alternating missions as either American pilots attacking a town, or a Luftwaffe ace trying to intercept said Americans. WWII FIGHTERS will be the game to show your friends how powerful your new computer is, thanks to the beautiful 3D engine. If you're more of a driver than a flyer, take a spin in Ubi Soft's MONACO GRAND PRIX RACING SIMULATION; you get to race two tracks in this demo from the people who brought you F1 RACING SIMULATION. Fans of Sid Meier's classic RAILROAD TYCOON will want to see if Phil Steinmeyer (designer of the first two HEROES OF MIGHT & Magic games) can recreate that old Sid magic with the demo of RAILROAD TYCOON II. You can either try to become a multimillionaire from the period between 1870 to 1905, or you could try to make a railroad that connects Cape Town and Cairo. Once you've mastered those two scenarios, you can fiddle with the map editor and lay out your own scenarios; you can't save in the demo, but at least you can brush up on the skills necessary for map-making. Action gamers, be sure to load up VIGILANCE, the GOLDEN EYE-style shooter where you play one of three agents sent out to assassinate a base commander. Once you've exhausted the single-player in the demo, you can hook up for a multiplayer deathmatch via H.E.A.T.

I recently purchased a copy of 101st AIRBORNE IN NORMANDY from Empire Interactive without waiting for a proper review from your magazine, and I paid the price. Simply put, expect better game play from a shareware program! The designers must not have bothered to check out classic turn-based tactical games like the ones in the X-COM series, JAGGED ALLIANCE or even WAGES OF WAR. They have to go and re-invent the wheel and did a lousy job at that! The equipment and weapon allocation was horrible, the interface was not well thought out, and that's even before I got into the plane and started the game! From the sound effects of soldiers walking or running, I felt like my whole unit was comprised of one-legged pirates. Enemy Al is one of the dumbest I have encountered and overall, there are no infantry tactics to speak of, either from the computer or the way I could deploy my men. This is ridiculous. Just once, I thought I could get away without waiting for the magazine review and take a chance on the latest turn-based wargame, since they are so few and far between. I was wrong.

"READ.ME THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD EDITED BY KEN BROWN @ZD.COM FIRST LOOK! >>>>>>> CN Space Case SYSTEM SHOCK 2 Pushes The Boundaries Again The lounge on the MedSci deck has seen better days. Note the X-COM-like inventory on the bottom and the stats screen to the right. Now that we have computers fast enough to play the 1994 classic, SYSTEM SHOCK, some of the original developers are creating a sequel that will throw down the gauntlet again. For those who didn't play it, the action/adventure hybrid brought loads of innovations, including a true 3D engine, sophisticated physics, and the ability to lean, crouch, climb walls, crawl through shafts, and look up and down. Looking Glass Studios combined these features with an elaborately detailed space sta tion populated with mutants, cyborgs and a malevolent central computer. Our December, 1994, review awarded the game four and one-half stars, calling it one hell of an immersive experience in a fully realized 3D environment.\" The sequel will retain much of the flavor of its ground-breaking predecessor, says the game's lead designer Ken Levine. You'll explore a cyberpunk-style space ship with an inventory, weapons and special skills including psionics and data hacking. You'll be able to lean and pull yourself up onto ledges, and there will be more to interact with, he says. The game is broken into levels by ship decks, but the world is 3 persistent, so you can leave an ammo clip on one deck, and come back later to retrieve it. The queen of malevolent mainframes, SHODAN, is back, but in a very different role (with even more \"air\" time than before). It's your job to kick the crap out of her robotic minions and shut her down. Expect plenty of resistance from motion-captured mutants and cyborgs. One of the main criticisms about SYSTEM SHOCK was that it lacked a sense of character development. The designers are working to improve this with role-playing-style character depth. It begins with an innovative in-engine character-generation system. You visit a recruiting office on Earth to choose one of three basic character types: Navy. Marines, or Secret Ops. After You'll find plenty of corpses on the ship. Note the Psionics multifunction display to the right A glimpse at the Engineering deck. This is the full-screen mode, accessible with a click of the mouse. you'll head to the starbase of that service. You develop your character there by choosing from missions during your period in the service (similar to the old paper RPG Traveller). The game is being developed in a partnership between Looking Glass Studios and Irrational Games They're using a modified version of Looking Glass' Dark Engine, which is being used for THIEF: THE DARK PROJECT. The engine supports 16 bit color; dynamic, colored lighting; a particle effects system; and objects with multiple translucency. Irrational is also building multiplayer support into the game. They haven't released hardware requirements yet, but we do know the game will require a 3D card. We'll continue to follow the game's development as it nears its spring release. -Ken Brown 40 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999  Car "


"Warthog on the READ.ME O Loose outlet Loose ur spies recently infiltrated the Austin, Texas-based Skunkworks of Jane's Combat Simulations. We were expecting to find the team diligently working on LONGBOW III the version rumored to be so detailed it would not only feature trees, but anacondas hanging from their branches. Rather than hearing rotor blades, the staccato \"brraaack\" of an Avenger cannon rattled the room, as an A-10 spewed depleted-uranium shells into the carcass of a Soviet-built tank. Instead of seeing a Longbow, we found a Warthog. JANE'S A-10 will let you fly the ugly but deadly ground attack jet flying a variety of missions, including strike, close air support, search and destroy, and escort tasks. Perhaps most interesting is the inclusion of a Forward Air Controller mission which will let you fly your Warthog into the war zone, identify targets, call in air strikes, and watch the deadly results. We uncovered a few more details during our recon, such as force-feedback support that will let you feel the A-10's Avenger cannon, and support for cooperative multiplayer missions over Jane's Combatnet. We even overheard optimistic murmers of a February ship date. We're assembling our team now for a deep cover recon mission, and expect to have full details on the sim in next month's issue. Denny Atkin Re-Confirmed ALLAMA BA ONFIRMED KILL, the World War Il massively multiplayer flight sim which graced CGW's cover way over three years ago, is finally nearing takeoff. recently put in some stick time in the beta version at Eidos' offices in San Francisco, and I'm pleased to report that this is coming together as one of the most innovative online sim designs in recent years. And best of all, a variety of adjustable mission settings make the design accessible to new pilots (a necessity for a successful online sim) while still maintaining the depth and accuracy demanded by experienced hard-core sim fans. Rather than the persistent online contests found in most other online sims, CONFIRMED KILL will let gamers recreate historical missions and campaigns, such as island hopping in the Pacific, the Battle of Midway, and the potential German invasion of the UK. Human pilots will team with Al fliers to create realistic force MAD RADIO balances. Most intriguing, though, is an adaptation of the FLYING NIGHTMARES 2 Commandant map which will let squadron commanders view recon of enemy territories and direct pilots to take out specific targets. An honorpoint system will encourage realistic and sportsmanlike gameplay, and as pilots gain points they'll be eligible for promotions and medals. CONFIRMED KILL is scheduled to be playable as a free open beta on TEN at www. ten.net by the time you read this. -Denny Atkin www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 47 "

With an ingenious convergence of Lego accessories and the home computer, MindStorms allows a user to create autonomous, computer-controlled robotic devices ranging from environmental explorers to battle tanks. These aren't just motorized Lego cre. ations—these are robots that actually react to their environment with the aid of touch, light, and temperature sensors. They can seek the safety of a dark corner; negotiate small obstacles; or act like simple pets that just roam about freely. You program the robot in two easy steps. The iconic, drag 'n drop interface is easy to use and looks more like puzzle-building than programming. When you're through, you beam the program to the robot's \"brain\" via an infrared transmitter attached to your serial port. The robot is now ready to be unleashed into the world. In a couple of hours a computer savvy, mechanically inclined user can begin building simple robots. To build something more advanced like a Mars Pathfinder could take several hours or days. While not particularly complicated, the sheer volume of the kit can be daunting. There are more than 700 Lego pieces in the kit, including the RCX computer brain; two touch sensors; one light sensor (rotation and temperature sensors are available separately); two motors; a software package including a setup program and tutorials; and complete documentation. In addition, you can augment the kit with nearly any Q1 99 Lego pieces, including the Lego Technic series and three special Mindstorms Expansion Sets. The system does have a few drawbacks, though. First, the Mindstorms software runs at 640x480 which makes it hard for a user to work with a large RCX program in the programming environment. Additionally, the interface is in 256 colors, so the user has to switch the computer's graphics mode down to 8bit. The RCX transmitter uses a serial port so the user may have to unplug a modem or other accessory. Also, some users have reported that they occasionally have to re-download the firmware to the RCX. The iconic programming system does not seem to use all of the capabilities of the RCX hardware as some advanced programmers may wish to use the \"Not Quite C\" scripting language to access programming variables. Finally, having five separate memory areas in which to store RCX programs in a user's robot may not be as effective as having one large memory area. Anyone who grew up with Lego and knows how to turn on a computer would have a great time building and programming robots with Mindstorms. It's the rare computer toy that is nonviolent, appeals to kids and adults alike, and is truly fun to play with. -Mike Weksler Q1 99 commands touch watchers Press Q2 99 ROBOT BY GERALD AZENARO; PHOTO BY MICHAEL FALCONER Waar controllers WE Former CGW Technical Editor Mike Weksler is the associate producer of Eidos' CONFIRMED KILL. ?

The cuts followed Interplay's dismal financial report for the quarter ending September 30. The company reported a net loss for the quarter of $15.1 million (compared with a net loss of $5.5 million for the same period in 1997). The company attributed the loss to \"shipping delays for FALLOUT 2 and lower than expected sales for WILD 9.\" Anonymous sources close to Interplay say that blaming FALLOUT 2 for the company's woes is like \"Blaming the Titanic disaster on the last life preserver being late to hit the water.\" The worst casualty in the cuts was Tribal Dreams, which was eliminated.

Papyrus is best known for its high-end NASCAR, INDYCAR and GRAND PRIX LEGENDS racing sims. Director of art production Vlad Starzhevsky, who has been at Papyrus for more than five years, said that about 20 artists in St. Petersburg produce substantial amounts of art for his company. \"These guys completed 11 tracks for NASCAR 99, some of which are better than the ones done by our U.S. artists,\" Starzhevsky said. Only four artists remain under Starzhevsky in the U.S. office. Papyrus general manager Igor Razboff said that the Russian artists know little of U.S. auto racing. \"But all that the artists need to do is re-create buildings and other structures from pictures,\" he said in an interview with GameSpot.

"EXCLUSIVE! READ.ME Dragon Fighter Dragons Reign in Blue Fang's Strategy/RPG Hybrid RAKAN might be the latest game to put you in the dragon's seat, but it won't be the last. Blue Fang Games, the company headed by former Papyrus pros Adam Levesque and John Wheeler, is developing a strategy/role-playing game that lets you play one of five types of dragons. DRAGON HOARD will feature a 3D world that lets you fly around from a thirdperson perspective. You'll fight other dragons and fantasy creatures, collect gold to increase your hoard, gain prestige and knowledge, and influence other races to do your bidding-all to become the most powerful dragon in the land. In the game's universe, dragons wield great influence over people, places and events. You decide how you want to play: You can use your power to subjugate the humans, ruling an area by fear and intimidation. Or you can choose to work in more positive ways to help the lesser races succeed, and as a result, worship the dragon for its wisdom and aid. You must become the most powerful dragon in the world, defeating all others, to win. The game will feature both single and multi-player modes. Former Papyrus Design Group members Adam Levesque and John Wheeler founded Blue Fang Games in July, 1998. Levesque was the producer/designer and Wheeler was the technical lead on NASCAR RACING and NASCAR RACING 2. They are joined by another former Papyrus member, Lou Catanzaro, and a business development director from AT&T, Hank Howie. Boston-based Blue Fang is currently attempting to secure a publishing deal for the title, which is expected to ship in 2000.

You tear around the huge levels sailing over obstacles and pulling boot legger turns while evading or facing off with nasties in their murder machines. If you don't happen to like the weapons in your jalopy, hop out, fire a special lightning weapon at another guy's street rod, shoot the owner when he staggers out, and then steal his car. Brutality and felony-how can you beat that? J udging from the four missions that I got to preview, REDLINE IS going to be a graphic wonder. The epic scale of the environments makes this game the Titanic of car combat. These are spaces so large they dwarf a mere four-car accident. The gameworld is rich with expansive stretches, eyeboggling heights, endlessly twisting city streets, and exotically sculpted interiors.

The futuristic settings may be pure imagination, but the vehicles boast their own realism that drives REDLINE out of no-brainer land and into fantasy sim territory. Even though the physical models for each car were still being adjusted in our preview version, these weapon-clad babies took a deft hand to successfully navigate through twisting streets and straight into armed enemies. The design team has wisely made compromises toward the cause of fun. In the preview, REDLINE's vehicles could take considerably more damage than your used Yugo, for instance. But there's none of the indestructible spin rolls and survivable 10-story drops as in the pure arcade racing of CARMAGEDDON, for example. REDLINE takes itself more seriously without taking itself too seriously. The upshot is that there is a lot to do behind the wheel. First, you obviously have to steer that car and tweak its speed a tricky business in the frequently close quarters of a REDLINE environment. To make those tight maneuvers, one finger has to dive at the Space Bar to yank the parking brake and execute a spinning \"bootlegger\" turn. When you recover from the turn, you'll want to nail that sniper on your tail, so you stab the firing key with a second finger. Oops, you haven't got the best weapon, so a third finger flies out to the Change Weapon key. If you want to line up the shot with an aerial view, that's another key; if you want to strafe, that's another key, and if you want to slow down, that's another key. Finally, if you want to glance around your vehicle or fire weaponry up and down, you'll need to have one hand on the mouse to smoothly alter your POV or direct your aiming reticule, which leaves you with only five fingers to speed type your way to survival. In short, whether playing with a mouse, keyboard, or joystick, I quickly found myself running out of fingers. Short of buying an oddlooking and probably very expensive prosthesis it will take some time to master just the driving phase of REDLINE. Hopefully, the interface will be streamlined prior to release. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 "

"Hired Guns Get a Whole New Perspective on Squad-based Combat—First Person SNEAK PREVIEWS DASTATS OPTIONS DO EVERYONE LEAD PATROL SNIPE O DIAMOND AUDE FURY RESI... > Select Myriel by Robert Coffey hat can a firstperson shooter do to distinguish itself these days? On the visual front, virtually every title has jaw-dropping 3D graphics. Deathmatches, capturethe-flag, and fortress-type variations are part and parcel of the multiplayer options in most shooters. Shotguns, rocket launchers, and some big-ass gunswhat game doesn't have those? After a certain point, it all starts to look and play the same. But HIRED GUNS, slated for a spring 1999 release, might just provide the breath of fresh air that the shooter genre is looking for. DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN While the active mercenary gazes at a garishly lit city, the other team members have infiltrated their objectives and await further orders. MOON SHOT With the UNREAL engine driving the game, you can expect lots of stunning graphics like these. Team Player While HIRED GUNS' futuristic, evil corporation back-story isn't going to win any awards for originality, the game breaks from the shooter ranks with its focus on squad-level combat. Gamers will directly control the actions of a four-man squad of mercenaries out to topple a trio of-here it comes--evil corporations. Gamers an olay as any of the there while giving order to the rest HIRED GUNS' unique approacia is immediately apparent in the main game screen. A full third of the monitor is filled with the active character's perspective. Along the bottom of the screen are three smaller windows, each reflecting the current view of the other team members. In the upper-right portion of the screen, you'll find a game interface that allows you to control your team. If you prefer to have a full-screen view of the active character, it's just a toggle key away. Available orders include: Patrol, Hide, Snipe, and Cover. Your forces can also be instructed to go into \"Fury\" mode, during which they will just run randomly around a level, firing at any enemy they come across. Further determining the behavior of your \"squaddies\" is an Al adjuster that will color their threat responses based on three priorities health orders, and abiectiver Set team imbercir watci: heir health and they'li retreat after taking a certain degree of damage. Mercenaries with a high order priority will walk into certain death if you order them to do so. Those mercs that have been given a high objective priority will focus their actions on fulfilling mission goals. The game interface will also allow you set group formations for your squad of mercs, including Diamond, Tight, and Line configurations. Additionally, a rally button will instruct your private army to make every effort to reach the active character's location. All Together Now Coordinating your team's actions and fully using its unique abilities will be a key to success in HIRED GUNS. As an example of team play, you may face a situation in which an enemy sniper is preventing you from entering a building. You'll have to instruct one member to attack the sniper with suppression fire so that other members may enter the building. But which member do you use in these situations? If you need to access a computer inside the building, you'll want to make sure the borg gets in so it can inter face with the computer system. If you expect incapacitating darkness, you'll want the mercenary with infrared vision inside the building instead of occupying the sniper. This emphasis on using the full team should be the rule rather than the exception since the design team is promising to build what they call \"tactically engaging levels.\" Powering all this is the ubiquitous UNREAL engine, so you can expect smooth gameplay with glittering graphics-provided you've got the hardware. The early build I saw was striking, with the action in each window sporting richly saturated color and smoothas-milk frame-rates. But don't expect the gameworld to look that good for long-Devil's Thumb is making a concerted effort to fill the environments with highly destructible objects. Destroying those objects should be a snap, given that you'll have a projected 17 weapons at your disposal. Of the weapons I saw, the most impressive was the sniper rifle. This rifle features an incremental zoom for targeting enemies at different distances and will take out most bad guys with a single, skull-shattering shot. Due to be on store shelves by mid-year, HIRED GUNS could bring a level of strategy and coordination heretofore lacking in firstperson shooters.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Total Annihilation: Kingdoms Cavedog's Fantasy Free-for-All Offers Tag-Team Excitement by Johnny L. Wilson As a preadolescent, I had a fascination for \"professional A wrestling.\" I may use the term advisedly, but the performers were paid and some wrestling occasionally took place. I wasn't all that enthusiastic about the one-on-one matches, but I could get really excited over the tag-team matches. Tag-team matches, for those of you who had more refined tastes than the young Johnny Wilson, were those in which a wrestler in trouble could touch the hand of his partner outside the ring and change places with him. This would, of course, shift the balance of the Genre: Real-time Strategy match by bringing fresh blood Release Date: Q2 '99 into the ring to take the place of the Developer: Cavedog beleaguered grappler. Entertainment The atmosphere was further charged by the fact Publisher: GT Interactive that one of the two-man teams was always the www.gtinteractive.com \"good guys,\" the play-by-the-rules guys; the other team was the \"bad guys,\" the cheat-if-you-can guys. It was melodrama. It was adrenaline-pumping excitement to an impressionable 10-year old. It worked. TOTAL ANNIHILATION: KINGDOMS is a fantasy tag-team match on a global scale. It's melodrama. It's excitement. It works. Like some classic tag-team grudge match, TA: KINGDOMS features two good kingdoms (Aramon and Veruna, representing the powers of Earth and Water respectively) against two evil kingdoms WRESTLING RING The tag(Taros and Zhon, representteam match between the four ing Fire and Air). The siblings in TA: Kingdoms takes wrestling ring comprises an place on the world Darien. entire world called Darien, where ambient magic called \"mana\" powers everything. The kingdom of Aramon resembles a magical version of the Roman Empire benevolent imperialists while Veruna is more cosmopolitan (think Venice during Marco Polo's era). Taros seems a near-demonic depiction of totalitarianism (complete with landscapes from hell), while Zhon has all the chaos of a sorcerous Third World nation set on a primitive continent. All four civilizations use magic, but the good kingdoms escalate warfare with gunpowder while the evil kingdoms up the ante with sorcery. In multiplayer terms, it's easy to imagine double crosses and stabs in the back. The global wrestling ring comes to life in a fourplayer struggle for domination. In single-player terms, the game features one continuous story from beginning to end, but you'll have to change sides (as the gamer, not as a character within the story) from time to time in order to experience the entire story. Designer Clayton Kauzlaric likes to think of the story as a novelized perspective. When you shift sides your viewpoint changes, complete with differences in interface art and music, as well as different units, spells, and powers at your disposal. Since the mage-kings (the comCREATURE FEATURES The mander units) of the four sorcery-wielding tag team of kingdoms are the offZhon and Taros often summon spring of the same monstrous creatures like this immortal mage-emperor, giant arachnid and dragon to do the storyline in TA: their nefarious bidding.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES begin fairly weak, but if you manage to keep them alive long enough, they can reach parity with high-level units. Units can improve in movement rate, armor class, weapon strength, mana ability, and building speed, among other factors. TA: KINGDOMS will also feature a limited number of some units (certain heroes and dragons) that, once lost, cannot be rebuilt. These characters or unique units will be introduced via narrative twists and should have the potential to shift the balance of play. Another intriguing balance shifter in TA: KINGDOMS is the appearance of deities. Any time a player builds a temple dedicated to a particular deity, there is a random chance that the god will take form as an avatar and participate in battles. Of course, such an incarnation may well presage a counterbalancing appearance by a rival deity. The game differentiates the four kingdoms not only in terms of units but also in terms of build cycles. In addition, the kingdom of Zhon has units with the capacity to self-replicate. They won't be able to engage in battle as they clone themselves, but the self-spawning capacity provides an awesome power, nonetheless. Other units will have built-in immunities to certain forms of attack (particularly the undead creatures who can be harmed only by magical attacks). Unlike the amazing disappearing dead of TA, corpses in TA: KINGDOMS will remain persistent for a time during the battle (the exact duration of this persistence has not yet been determined). As long as the corpses remain, high-level priests from Aramon and Veruna can resurrect the units. High-level sorcerers from Taros or Zhon, however, can reanimate the units into zombies or skeletons. The naval units for TA: KINGDOMS are particularly impressive. War galleys, men-of-war, and fire ships abound, complete with animated oars, flowing pennants, turning rudders, and billowing sails. Partisans of ancient naval warfare will be disappointed that the game doesn't allow ramming or shearing (when a lighter, faster ship runs alongside the hull of a heavier, slower ship, breaking off its oars to reduce its speed and maneuverability prior to ramming it). The naval warfare is closer to that of the Byzantine Era, when projectile weapons and Greek Fire were becoming the order of the day, and rams had a tendency to break after one use. More important, all ships in the game have a variable transport capacity, adding to logistic flexibility and the art of maneuver. One other unit that enhances the play in TA: KINGDOMS is the Mage Healer. The Mage will have a healing radius and will automatically begin to restore hit points to damaged units within that radius. Of course, the opposition will have its corresponding tag-team partner: certain advanced undead units that will be able to sap strength from any unit entering their vampiric radius. spice of sibling rivalry to the standard good guys versus bad guys conflict. 19, In This Corner... The combatants in TA: KINGDOMS differ greatly from the contenders in TOTAL ANNIHILATION. Whereas the original incarnations of TA allowed for the rapid addition of new units, constantly expanding the size of army orders of battle, TA: KINGDOMS will ship with about 160 different units and the downloadable units will not be released as often. TA: KINGDOMS displays characters and vehicles in a larger format than did its predecessor, a nod to gamers who complained that it was difficult to discern physical differences between many of the units in TA. The games differ also in how they treat those units. TA treated units like expendable minions; TA: KINGDOMS will use a new experience point system to actually reward gamers who conserve their units. For example, your swordsmen STERN WARRING The ancient ships and war galleys look impressive. The Greek Fire and broadsides look great, but don't you wish you could run along the side of those galleys and shear off their oars?

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Close Combat III Third Time's a Charm from the time you boot the program. The Germans have tanks galore and a well-developed command structure to go with a core of veteran troops. The Soviets counter with heavier tanks, lots of antitank guns, and the dreaded human wave tactic. The first time Last Dance at the Volga by Terry Coleman L istorians constantly argue over which battle of the Revolutionary War was the most significant, or whether Lee could have won at Gettysburg on the second day if he'd pressed harder, or whatnot. When it comes to the eastern front of World War II, however, most of the arguments focus on minutiae because the big themes of the conflict are pretty much free of debate. When the Germans launched Operation Barbarossa, they set in motion the single largest land conflict in history. Over the course of four years, tens of millions were captured, wounded, or killed. The very names of the battles still resonate, even more than a half-century later: the desperate defense of Moscow; the bitter, protracted siege of Leningrad; the turning point at Stalingrad; the largest tank battle in history at Prokorovka; the liberation of Warsaw; and the sacking of Berlin. Most of the great boardgames and computer wargames of the past three decades cover this monumental conflict from either an overall strategic or a middle-ground operational Genre: Real-time WWII viewpoint. CLOSE COMBAT III, true to its name, gets Release Date: Q1 '99 its hands dirty at the grunt level. Even more than A Developer: Atomic Games BRIDGE TOO FAR, CLOSE COMBAT III succeeds at porPublisher: Microsoft traying the chaos of the battlefield. But it never gets www.microsoft.com/ unmanageable and is always engrossing. Part of this is due to the situation: Almost every kind of WWII battle you can imagine was fought on the eastern front. Still, it's a tribute to the design that a system started as primarily an infantry-oriented simulation now easily handles the vast number of tanks, half-tracks, artillery units, and other military hardware that took center stage for much of 1941-45. The Al doesn't simply maneuver these war machines competently, it also uses them adeptly to exploit its terrain advantages, especially in building-to-building fighting at least in the scenarios that have been finished at this point. If you thought that enemy firepower was deadly in A BRIDGE TOO FAR, you'll be running for cover here almost Viewed from farthest zoom-out, the fighting in the factories at Stalingrad resembles nothing so much as a paper wargame, with the unit Icons appearing like cardboard counters. At medium view, you get a better idea of how desperate the Soviet situation is. Note the gray German tank to the left of the screen, closing to support the 88mm antitank guns. CONCENTRIC COMMAND The multicolored circles not only contrast sharply with the barren battlefield, they also show the command radius for each commander and his subordinates. In extreme close-up, you get an idea of how aggressive the German Al is, though I might have waited for more units, the Germans have racked up quite a body count.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Atomic for Power, Turbines for Speed (With apologies to Adam West) are things the design doesn't yet allow for. You don't see-as occasionally happened in real life-units being outfitted for summer campaigns but having to fight in the snow. Because the battles are short and sweet (a boon for multiplayer action), you don't deal with trying to paradrop supplies into the surrounded German Sixth Army at Stalingrad. But these are quibbles, and there are plenty of other games if you want to be Guderian or Zhukov. If, however, you want to be a small-unit commander moving up through the ranks of the German or Soviet army, there's no better place to be-at least on the PC. CLOSE COMBAT III come wargame designers-Norm Koger, for one-create games from all periods of history. Keith Zabalaoui and his crew at Atomic Games have stuck to simulating the battles of WWII, but they have a lot more range than they get credit for. Besides, I know Zabalaoui is still dying to do a Starship Troopers game. The V FOR VICTORY series was ahead of its time in many ways, combining the familiarity of boardgame conventions with better functionality and a generally easier learning curve. Sure, the games were turnbased, but for operational-level games, it's yet to be proven that real-time action is better. These were some of the first SVGA games, not just for strategy/war games, but for any genre. The best of these was UTAH BEACH (released by 360 Pacific in 1993), a marvelous, tense look at D-Day that holds up a half-dozen years later. It's still available on CD in THE COMPLETE WARGAME COLLECTION from SSI. Later games in the series added technical innovations, but as games they were handicapped by their settings. After the demise of 360 Pacific, Atomic entered into a relationship with Avalon Hill. The two companies had somewhat different ways of approaching game design, but the tensions worked positively in OPERATION CRUSADER, easily the best PC game set entirely in North Africa. At this point, Atomic's Al did a much better job attacking than defending. Since the best \"mobile defense\" in Crusader was to counterattack, the computer opponent acquitted itself pretty well-making this worth buying if you can find it. Maybe Hasbro will consider reprinting this as part of an \"AH computer classics\" collection. INVASION OF THE ANTS CLOSE COMBAT III does a wonderful job of showing the Soviet's human-wave tactic in action: It can be especially effective when employed with camouflaged troops in the snow. FORCE POOL PRE FIRS The creative tension between Avalon Hill and Atomic became outright dissonance in STALINGRAD, not at all based on the old AH boardgame. The operational-level scenarios worked fine, but the late addition of a 400meter-per-hex scale for some parts of the fighting within the city simply didn't work. As a contest between two human generals, however, this is still a good game. CTIVE ROSTER A LARGE ANG SA CLOSE COMBAT, Atomic's first game for Microsoft inspires respect more than pleasure. It often feels as though the game were running under its own steam—the last thing you want in this kind of game since hard-core wargamers are notorious for being control freaks. Requisition Prints SEASES RUSSIAN TREASURE The currency of CLOSE COMBAT III is measured in requisition points. The higher you rank, the more you can spend on units and the more elite units you gain access to. This time Atomic got it right and truly captured the flavor of small-level WWII combat. The psychological profiles are more fleshed-out in CLOSE COMBAT: A BRIDGE TOO FAR than in the original, and the game works better on every level-particularly for multiplayer action. If you don't already have this in your collection, you're missing a real treat (but it's not too late to drop a hint for Christmas). With the success of this game and the upcoming sequel, it's doubtful we'll ever see the Atomic folks going back to turn-based games—which is a real shame since they've shown they can do both. doesn't require a Pentium II 400 or the hottest 3D accelerator on the market. What it does require is a cool head, a love of challenges, and a desire to immerse yourself in the grittiest land campaign in history. I've been critical of many real-time wargames in the past few years because the \"real\" was too often missing.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Homeworld This Sci-Fi Strategy Game Pushes the boundaries of 3D Space by Robert Coffey nid you ever want to jump out of your Excalibur star fighter in a WING COMMANDER game and start calling the shots instead of just taking them? Did you ever wonder just who was drawing up the mission plans in TIE FIGHTER? Did you ever think to yourself, \"I can come up with a better strategy than this\" in DESCENT: FREESPACE? Well, you Commander Adama wanna-be, HOMEWORLD may be the answer to your prayers-serving up heaps of epic space combat in which you create and command huge fleets of space vessels instead of just pilot them. As leader of an entire civilization fleeing from adversaries who have driven you from your adopted home, you'll traverse space in a desperate race to find the legendary planet of your origin: your homeworld. Adding to the game's graphic appeal is its ONLINE zoom feature. Pull out for Look for another HOMEWORLD a wide view and you'll preview at www.gameguides.com be able to take in every ship in the sector-zipping fighters trailing ion streams, gently spinning research stations, enemy bombers peppering the hull of your massive mothership with exploding plasma bombs. Zoom in tight and you can ride right behind a wing of attacking fighters, all the better to ogle the glowing engines and brilliant explosions. Beautiful and dramatic, the action in HOMEWORLD could run the risk of working against its playability since gamers may neglect their strategic duties to marvel at the splendor of the gameworld. But odds are that won't happen since HOMEWORLD seems poised to give gamers some of the most innovative strategy gaming in a long time. Just the addition of a truly three-dimensional world promises to open up all sorts of new strategic challenges. You'll be able to flank enemies from above and below as well as from the sides, but surrounding a key enemy target should prove more daunting given that those targets will have more avenues for escape than in a traditional game. Viewing your position from various angles will be vital to your success, so HOMEWORLD utilizes a camera with a full 360 degrees of freedom. This lets you whip from a view high above your mothership to just below it in a heartbeat. Should you need to check on scout ships far from your primary position, you'll be able to call up the strategic map of that sector and click on those units to be instantly transported to their position. Battlestar Fantastica The first thing you'll notice about HOMEWORLD are the graphics. Visually, the game should be stunning.

Getting There From Here Directing the actions of units in a true 3D environment presents a slew of challenges not present in other games. Given that your monitor is a two-dimensional device, you can't select a unit and actually click on a point in space: How does the unit know where on that plane you want it to go? Should it move straight ahead or five miles deeper? To its credit, the design team at Relic is doing a good job developing an interface that doesn't get in the way of enjoyment yet allows gamers to control their forces with precision. As in most real-time strategy titles, units in HOMEWORLD can be gathered into groups by simply clicking and dragging a box around them. Groups can be of an unlimited number and can be assigned to hot-keys. For the tricky business of moving units, you'll simply press the M key, which calls up a graphic overlay of a large dish representing the horizontal plane the selected units currently occupy. Clicking anywhere on that dish sends those units to that point. To send them to a place either above or below that point on the plane, you'll have to press another key. This will allow you to move your cursor off the original plane and triangulate a destination for your units. In print it sounds clumsy, but in practice it's quick and effective. In fact, a great deal of the interface relies on using the keyboard. Gamers who have never used hot-keys for actions in games such as STARCRAFT will probably have some adjusting to do. Keys are used not only to direct movement, but also to call up the SHOOTING STARS HOMEWORLD's free-moving camera allows for some breathtaking perspectives of battle.

Jane's Combat Simulations-a cooperative venture between Electronic Arts and the original Jane's-has built a similar reputation for accurately portraying weapons systems with titles like LONGBOW, F-15, and 688(1) HUNTER/KILLER. Now that Jane's Combat Simulations has risen to prominence in the simulations market, it is turning its sights to strategy gaming with FLEET COMMAND, a real-time naval warfare strategy game. FLEET COMMAND is an interesting hybrid: Although the game features a command interface that's no harder to use than your typical COMMAND & CONQUER clone, the battles aren't simplified and abstracted as they are in most real-time strategy games. You'll watch your attacks play out in a 3D window that seems ripped from a flight simulation.

Publisher: Jane's Combat Simulations Not Sub-standard www.janes.ea.com This simulation influence isn't surprising when you realize that FLEET COMMAND's developer is Sonalysts, which has been creating tactical and weapons-platform simulations for the Navy for a number of years. Jane's 688(1) HUNTER/KILLER, a nuclear attack submarine sim, marked Sonalysts' entry into the consumer simulation market. The developer had planned to follow that product with a detailed Aegis missile cruiser sim. As that sim evolved, the designers realized that, since they had to simulate an entire carrier battle group anyway, they had the workings of an interesting tactical strategy game. The weapons roster in FLEET COMMAND includes the major naval and naval/aerial weapons systems for 19 countries. With the inclusion of ocean maps for the entire planet, there's literally a world of possibilities for potential missions. Whether you want to play out a melee between American and Russian carrier groups, restage the battle for the Falkland Islands, simulate a Middle East hostage rescue, or create a hypothetical regional conflict between India and Pakistan, the appropriate maps and tools are here. The game equips each force with a fairly complete lineup of current-technology ships and aircraft. The United States, for instance, features carriers, missile cruisers, destroyers, Marine assault craft, nuclear attack subs, and a wide variety of other ships. On the aviation side, the U.S. has F-14 Tomcats, F/A-18 Hornets, EA-6B Prowlers, S-3 and ES-3 Vikings, E-3 Hawkeyes, and a variety of helicopters. Other vehicles are available when appropriate: If you have a Marine assault ship in your force mix, you'll also have AV-8B Harriers and AH-1 SuperCobras. And land bases will give you access to P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare aircraft. You don't need to be a military buff or a wargamer to be able to command these forces.

The game will support Glide, Direct3D, and OpenGL 3D cards. The 3D interface doesn't give you an unrealistic advantage when it comes to identifying the enemy. If you've detected a unit but haven't sent in a recon flight to identify it, the unit appears in the 3D window as a generic ship or aircraft shape. This anonymity is important because many missions will require you to make an ID before firing on the enemy. And beware—that plane coming at your carrier battle group may well be a civilian Airbus.

With a Ticonderoga class cruiser, you'll find available guns, cannons; SAMs; torpedoes; and Harpoon, TLAM, and TASM missiles. To get the most out of your forces, you'll want to understand the strengths of each unit and weapon. This is where the Jane's connection comes in. Basic information on a unit's status and capabilities appears when you select it. If you need more data, just press the appropriate key and you can get full performance information and descriptions from Jane's Fighting Ships, Jane's All the World's Aircraft, and other publications put out by the company. The game will have scalable realism. For instance, with the difficulty settings dialed up. it will take a specific amount of time to ready aircraft and helicopters for launch. Putting a plane on Alert 5 status will let you launch it within 5 minutes of game time, but it takes 25 minutes to prepare a plane for Alert 5. Gamers looking for a more immediate experience will be able to set the game so that it takes 30 seconds, not 30 minutes, between selecting a hangared plane and launching it. Of course, even if you're playing with full realism, you'll be able to accelerate time when there's no action. SILENT RUNNING A nuclear attack submarine slides under the ice. When you have subs at your disposal, you'll be able to give them orders only when they come to communications depth.

You have a choice of NATO replace the NATO unit symbols with unit symbols or simple unit icons, displayed on ship and plane icons. a topographical map of the combat theater. But the game is far from plain. A 3D window in the bottomcenter of the screen shows a detailed view of the selected unit. And I mean detailed: FLEET COMMAND features texture-mapped 3D terrain, moving seas, and highly detailed 3D vehicles. When you fire a weapon, it shoots from the appropriate location CUSTOM COMBAT The editor in FLEET COMMAND includes a on your ship or plane, number of handy shortcuts, including one that creates an complete with semientire carrier battle group with two clicks. transparent smoke Scripted, but Not Predictable FLEET COMMAND will include three mission types: training, single mission, and campaign. At this point in development, while the campaigns are actually single missions, they're very long-running ones in which you'll have to achieve multiple goals before winning the battle. Although the missions are prescripted, the game should still offer long-term playability. FLEET COMMAND includes a very sophisticated, yet easy-to-use mission editor, which should help spawn numerous add-on missions on the Internet. Even the built-in missions are good for multiple replays since the editor supports multiple levels of randomness. You can set a number of types of ships and aircraft in a task force and set percentage chances—not only for which ones will appear, but also for where they'll appear. When you replay, therefore, you may find yourself facing a dramatically different force mix approaching from a different area of the map. This system offers the creative control of scripted missions, while giving players the unpredictability of a dynamic campaign. In multiplayer mode, up to nine sides can be present, and there are intriguing opportunities for teamwork. For instance, you might set up one player to handle an aircraft carrier and its planes, while another player handles the other ships in the same battle group. Jane's is concerned that gamers realize FLEET COMMAND is a strat game, not a sim. But the title has the potential to have very wide appeal. Strategy gamers looking for a more in-depth experience than the typical click-fest will find it appealing. The systems modeling is so deep that the game will likely appeal to the wargaming crowd, and sim fans can look at it as a \"third-person\" naval sim. However it's classified, it's a breath of fresh air in a me-too market. CGW UKWONN TRAEE006 COUNT www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 95 "

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Civilization: Call to Power Can Activision Remake CIVILIZATION in its Own Image? Genre: Turn-based Historical Release Date: Q2 '99 Developer: Activision Publisher: Activision www.activision.com NO ONE KNOWS WHO THEY WERE But your rivals will know where you come from if you build Stonehenge. by Terry Coleman In 1997, Avalon Hill, motivated by a need for cash flow and a desire to strike a blow at MicroProse-which it had long considered to have ripped off one of its most prized franchises-licensed the computer rights for ADVANCED CIVILIZATION to Activision. Since SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION II was one of the few MicroProse titles making a ton of money over the past three years, the MicroProse folks in Alameda protected their investment by suing for copyright infringement. MicroProse delivered its legal masterstroke by purchasing Hartland Trefoil's boardgame company, the original designers of the Civilization boardgame, effectively ending any claim Avalon Hill had to the title. When the litigious smoke settled, Avalon Hill had lost all rights to ADVANCED CIVILIZATION, including the boardgame rights (which it had held in North America for 17 years). The more than $400,000 settlement that Avalon Hill had to pay in legal fees hastened the end of the company. Activision came out of the suit ahead, as it gained the rights to publish CIVILIZATION: CALL TO POWER and at least one add-on SEXTANT AT MY SIDE Some of the product. As one fortech advances will be quite familiar mer AH employee to Civ II players—if a bit gussied up. as with Oceanfaring here. said, \"Can you imagine Activision going to MicroProse before all of this and asking for rights to publish a CIVILIZATION Competitor to Meier's game? They'd have laughed (Activision CEO Bobby Kotick out of the state.\" The irony of all this is that MicroProse and Avalon Hill are now both owned by Hasbro, so something might eventually happen with ADVANCED CIVILIZATION. In the meantime, however, we have CALL TO POWER, and it's a good thing that the legal posturing is over, because Activision's CIVILIZATION is so obviously based on Meier's game that any lawyer would be muttering \"look-and-feel lawsuit\" in his or her sleep. Just imagine the three-quarter perspective of SID MEIER'S CIV ll in 16-bit color, with bigger sprites à la AGE OF EMPIRES, and you have a good idea of the game's layout. The varying time scale, with turns representing fewer and fewer years as you enter the modern era, is left virtually unchanged. Even now, the pacing and the flow of the game is Civ-like, so the design team has nailed at least one aspect of its intended audience. Wonder of Wonders Several things have changed from CIV II, however. The Great Library is now reduced to essentially a Civilopedia, and a lot of your other favorite Wonders of the World are either footnotes or missing altogether. The good news is that the new Wonders of the World are interesting, and there are a lot more of them proportionally later in history-which is when a typical CIVILIZATION II game tends to slow down a bit. The Global E-Bank network, for example, serves much the same function as Adam Smith's Trading Company in CIV II, except that it increases your funds in the 21st century. The most controversial of the new Wonders will undoubtedly be the Emancipation Proclamation. You see, CALL TO POWER is the first 96 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Living in the Real World game in a long time to deal with the emotionally charged institution of slavery throughout history. While some gamers may find the idea repugnant, slavery hardly seems out of place in a game in which every civilization can blithely go around nuking one another. In CALL TO POWER, using slave labor is cheaper than using your own populace, but the temptation to do so lessens with more enlightened forms of The design team for CALL TO POWER comprises some of the biggest CIVILIZATION freaks I've ever met. Like me, they would be eternally happy playing the main campaign of what project director Cecilia Barajas called \"the most replayable game ever made.\" Problem is, CALL TO POWER goes further through history than even CIV I from 4000 B.C. to A.D. 3000. Not everyone these days has the time or the patience for a 40hour game especially for multiplay. Activision plans a battle.net-type server, ActivLink, to host CALL TO POWER Internet games (whether this service will be live by the time the game ships was unclear at press time). The game should support LAN and direct modem linkup as well. One thing the design team is still hedging is exactly how turns will work in multiplayer format. One possibility is to do everything in simultaneous turns, as in WARLORDS III. But CALL TO POWER pushes around more information per turn than WARLORDS ever dreamed of, with high-res graphics to boot. Regardless, Activision intends to have a number of scenarios playable in an hour: an ambitious goal, and an obvious attempt to appeal to the AGE OF EMPIRES crowd. Let's hope it works. MC-97 government. The revolt, and other nasty things, all in the name of organized religion. By the way, the advanced unit of the cleric in CALL TO POWER is the televangelist, every bit as creepy as that sounds (unless I have one, of course). Emancipation Proclamation effectively ends slavery as an institution, not only gaining victory (and moral) points for your side, but also likely wrecking the economy of your enemies. It's a bold stand, and whether it will work with Civ fans remains to be seen. Still, you have to admire Activision's guts in not HARRIET TUBMAN'S taking the politically correct route (just FRIEND? Abolitionists think how often SS units have been conget their due in CALL veniently left out of WWII games). In any TO POWER; shown is case, CALL TO POWER lets you toggle off both an early waterslavery, just as you can any other major color painting and item in the design. the final computergenerated art. Let's Get Religion! The freshest things in CALL TO POWER aren't so much the new unitsLeviathan Heavy Tanks, for instance, are just a variation on units found in every sci-fi strategy game from COMMAND AND CONQUER to TOTAL ANNIHILATION—as the new government types. Most of these take their inspiration from some unpleasant aspect of history generally ignored by games. My favorites are the Ecotopians, a bizarre group that seems to idolize the \"Free Love\" period of the 1960s but is prone to outbursts of extreme violence-sort of \"Greenpeace meets Islamic Jihad,\" according to lead designer William Westwater. In addition to normal tactics, these ecoterrorists can set off an LSD-like bomb in an enemy city-which tends to render the city somewhat ineffective, whether or not it goes into revolt immediately. The Ecotopians even have their own antiWonder, a Genesis device that remakes all life on the planet in a new image (though without as yet the cool special effects from Star Trek: Wrath of Khan). Religion also rears its head, with clerics that are similar to the priests from AGE OF EMPIRES. In addition to simply converting enemies to your side, clerics can drain an enemy city of gold, entice its population to War and Peace Since Activision doesn't have access to the source code for CIV II, it may be hard for the company to match that design's sophisticated diplomacy system. But the designers have implemented a fairly detailed menu-driven interface to let you trade land or goods for cash or military units. We imagine they'll continue to play-balance this system and integrate it into the economic model right up until the game ships. Combat, on the other hand, is already well fleshed out. Unlike CIV II, CALL TO POWER gives you advantages for attacking or defending with a stack of units, including combined arms modifiers-like those in WARLORDS III, but not as detailed or realistic as in THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR. As you go further into the future, you get more high-tech units, such as a futuristic U2-style spy plane, which may be based on the rumored Aurora of the U.S. Air Force. In general, there seems to be greater emphasis on recon units that help to lift the fog-of-war. In another departure from classic Civ, units can utilize a more active defensive posture, and some units even havegasp!-ranged combat. Will all of these changes from classic CIV lore work? It's hard to say, though I'll freely admit I had a good time with the beta. The play balance is the thing here, since many of your tried-and-true CIV strategies will need tweaking if you are to survive in this New World order. I'm still a bit skeptical of the game not ending until A.D. 3000, because it smacks of a cheap attempt to end-run SID MEIER'S ALPHA CENTAURI. My main concern, however, is that Activision, with its recent track record for shipping incomplete products, takes the time to finish this promising game. Then we can spend more time arguing the merits of Ecotopian versus Fundamentalist governments and less time downloading patches. CGW UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE The Ecoterrorist, the Slaver, the Combat Engineer, and the Infector (who specializes in biological warfare) show how much the units differ from those of Civ II. 100 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Civilization II Multiplayer Gold Edition Mining for More Gaming Treasure you have to feel a little sympathy for the folks at MicroProse. Here they are, with a new version of one of the greatest games of all time, wondering exactly how far they can stretch the design. Do too much that's unfamiliar, and you risk alienating the more than 1 million fans of SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION II. Add too little that's new, and you have what one CGW editor called \"a multiplayer patch for a two-year-old game.\" Since they do plan to charge money, it's nice that CV || MULTIPLAYER GOLD will at least be comprised fully of 32-bit code: 50 long, WinG. It also supports TCP/IP, IPX, LAN, and even play-by-email, complete with standard and simultaneous turns, with an optional timer for each gamer. Our experience when playing multiplayer was that some of the scenarios worked rather well, but it's hard to finish a full campaign game. To be fair, CIV II works much better with four to six people than MOO II ever did, and while it isn't as smooth as AGE OF EMPIRES, you have by far more diplomacy. You can't simply rush into the middle of the map and start bashing away. Even for solo players, this might be a good buy because you get classic Civ II (which now runs faster), plus a number of additional scenarios. Since Hasbro Genre: Turn-based Historical seems to be giving the team plenty of time Release Date: Q4 '98 to work out the kinks, this game should Developerl Publisher: avoid the problems associated with 1995's Hasbro/MicroProse CIVNET.-Terry Coleman www.microprose.com Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri It's World Building at its Best as You Settle the Final Frontier ver wonder what happened to the colonists who left Earth at the Lend of CIV II? ALPHA CENTAURI gives you the chance to find out. In the game a group of U.N. colonists crash-land on a mysterious planet, and seven factions splinter off from the group-each seeking to settle the planet according to its own principles and ethos. With factions including God-fearing fundamentalists, radical militarists, planet-hugging conservationists, and money-loving capitalists, there should be a splinter group to appeal to every type of strategy gamer. An enormous tech tree lies at the heart of ALPHA CENTAURI. Researchable technologies are based on plausible science, not the more fanciful stuff of something like, oh, Lost in Space. Research will yield a host of new options affecting your sociological structure, your ability to exploit the planet, the units you can build, ONLINE and other factors.

K. you already have one Civ II title in production--CIVII MULTIPLAYER-50 of course you add another. Huh? What's more confusing is that no one at MicroProse seems to know where this product is going It's evidently going to have a lot of scenarios and a full campaign based on the Midgard world from CIV II: FANTASTIC WORLDS. Then again, MicroProse hinted that it might develop Alpha Centauri scenarios: It's not nice to take shots at Sid Meier (or his next game) just because he's gone, folks. Aside from the attempts to add a little 3D and some animation to the three-quarter CIV Il perspective, little else seems new here. MicroProse can't even guarantee that TEST OF TIME will support multiplay. Part of the problem is that the management has insisted that every product in the Civ II line be backward compatible. With that kind of thinking, it's no wonder we have this Genre: Turn-based Historical muddle instead of a potential CIV III. The only Release Date: Q2 '99 reason not to give up on this product is that Developer: MicroProse Mick Uhl, who gave us the excellent Publisher: Hasbro/MicroProse CONFLICTS IN CIVILIZATION add-on, heads the project.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES LOCKNEEDMAR FIGHTER SERIES Combat Mission A Fighting Phoenix Emerges From the Ashes of Squad Leader D esigner Charlie Moylan likes to be different. Because he loved the U Macintosh, he designed FLIGHT COMMANDER for that platform, even though all his fellow designers told him you really couldn't make money that way. As vastly improved graphics and processor capabilities led to a new generation of high-end flight simulators for the PC, Moylan decided he would rather make turn-based flight-combat games. After it became apparent that he and Avalon Hill weren't seeing eye-to-eye on the specs for COMPUTER SQUAD LEADER, Moylan removed any traces of copyrighted Avalon material from his design and launched into COMBAT MISSION. What he has achieved thus far is potentially the best tactical WWII game we've seen. COMBAT MISSION is more playable than TIGERS ON THE PROWL and more realistic than games like the upcoming SHADOW COMPANY, and it sports a better interface than STEEL PANTHERS. MULTIROLE FIGHTER.

Moreover, the game seems to have no trouble handling tricky vertical (y-axis) lines of sight, even when a unit is partially obscured by slopes or terrain.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Fighting Steel Polish Your Long Lance Torpedo MiG-29 FULCRUM The lines between ship simulators and wargames always blur a bit, parI ticularly because reflexes-at least in games-are not quite so important at sea as they are up in the virtual clouds. We'll still claim FIGHTING STEEL as a naval wargame, because it requires that you think in terms of commanding task forces rather than captaining an individual vessel. If you insist on reliving your bygone GREAT NAVAL BATTLES (GNB), there is plenty of micromanagement available here. (Thankfully, you don't have to play SimShipFireman as you did in the too-combustible GNB3.) But the good news is that FIGHTING STEEL de-emphasizes that level of management. Rather than require you to run around and do everything from loading torpedoes to identifying the radar contacts yourself, the game has you concentrate on the giving of orders. To that end, the interface has been modified since our last visit with the game (CGW #170), so that you can more easily command your formation of ships. Not every vessel will snap to as quickly as you'd like, however, and that reveals a particularly nice design feature: Everything depends on crew quality. Mediocre crews not only take longer to zero in on a designated target, they also reload more slowly than crack crews, and they tend to drift out of formation.

Nonetheless, the 3D ship models show promise, and it seems as if SSI will require a 3D card for this one. Once the more than 100 ship classes are ready to go, they'll sail through campaigns for both the Japanese and Allies during the years 1941-43. Before you complain about the time limitation, keep in mind that it reflects a reality the Japanese faced: If they could not win by the end of 1943, they were simply going to be ground down by the weight of the U.S. industrial war machine, Also, FIGHTING STEEL focuses strictly on surface ship combat-no subs and no aircraft carriers and that doesn't leave a whole lot to simulate after 1943. Given SSI's trumpeting of its integrated LIVING BATTLEFIELD series, however, I wouldn't be surprised to see a carrier battle or three in some future product. Current plans are for FIGHTING STEEL to support IPX, TCP/IP, and LAN-a very good thing, since this game is most likely to hit its stride when played online. Most real-life naval battles were essentially over in an hour or less. FIGHTING STEEL, like most games of this type, has a default speed a bit faster than real life, and it's easily adjustable. You can thus spend more time contemplating your stately maneuvers than Admiral Halsey ever had, or you can navigate on the fly while trying to sink your buddies over a lunch break. This game is taking almost as long to finish as it took for MacArthur to return to the Philippines, but it looks as if it will be worth it. -Terry Coleman SHROUDED IN SECRECY BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN UNTIL NOW...

Word quickly got around that Star Fleet Battles (SFB) was as close as you were likely to get to being Captain KirkCHOOSE SHIP HULLor Captain Kang of the Klingon Empire or a secretive Romulan commander. As time went on, however, the boardgame added so many complex rules that it nearly collapsed under its own weight. Luckily for Trekkers Interplay's STAR FLEET COMMAND brings the classic SFB to the PC, replacing the often tedious impulse system of the boardgame with a thoughtfully paced real-time movement. This is no space sim, Vulcan-boy: You maneuver your Genre: Real-Time Sci-fi fleet of starships via mouse and hot-keys through a Release Date: Q2 '99 panoramic view very much like that of Star Trek: Wrath Developer: Quicksilver of Khan.

Since we last wrote about STAR FLEET (CGW #166), new races from the boardgame-Lyrans and Hydrans, among others-have been added to the official Star Trek universe with Paramount Pictures! permission, which means more starfaring races and cool sci-fi weaponry to play with. More than 100 different ship hulls of various races are planned for the game, so that you can cruise near the Neutral Zone with a souped-up Romulan War Eagle, take on diplomatic missions in an Enterprise-class Federation Heavy Cruiser, or hide in a nearby nebula in your sporty new Orion Pirate Raider. STAR FLEET now fully supports Direct3D, and it's possible that there will be a software-only solution as well (after all, you'll want to make the galaxy safe for Klingons even on your laptop), but Interplay isn't guaranteeing this yet. The Al is still being tweaked as we go to press, but the multiplayer mode already works. Plans are to have SFB support up to four gamers by LAN and IPX. The only concern I currently have is how well the Dynaverse (dynamic universe) campaign will turn out. It's certainly ambitious to let gamers pursue their own careers in an open-ended game, and if Quicksilver and Interplay can pull it off, we could have the Star Trek computer combat game we've always wanted-even if we did have to wait two decades. —Terry Coleman QSOUND alwa MULTIMEDIA SPEAKERS WWW.AIWA.COM/MM 1-800-920-2673 www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  JANUARY 1999 139 "

Casting the gamer in the role of a malevolent, dungeon-building fiend, DK2 promises to provide a www.ea.com more than adequate outlet for all those antisocial tendencies. Bullfrog is wisely not tampering too much with the original game, focusing their efforts instead on enhancing and growing the title. Gamers will still construct dungeons full of torture chambers, gold hoards, and Horned Reapers, only now they'll be able to toss brutal Black Knights and Queens of the Nest into the mix. New spells to combat the forces of good include a wall and creature toppling Tremor spell, and a costly Turncoat spell that will convert enemies and get them to stab their former compatriots in the back. Direct3D will allow for flashy lighting and texture effects, while full support for LAN and Internet play will let gamers battle other evil geniuses.

Martian forces will use their advanced technology while the British will rely on late 19th-century Publisher: GT Interactive steam technology to power their units. While both www.gtinteractive.com sides will have to gather and manage resources, this technological disparity will dictate that each side pursue different materials. The game promises to unfold across a strategic map of the British Isles. Instead of battling in a predetermined sequence of scenarios, gamers will marshal their forces, then invade or reclaim sectors of the map. This nonlinear, tug-of-war combat should lend a significant amount of replayability to the game. Battles should be spirited affairs, taking place both day and night and using a wide variety units, including underwater and underground vehicles. Like every game but MINESWEEPER, WAR OF THE WORLDS will support the latest 3D technology. Gamers with the right hardware can look forward to full 3D-animated objects; dynamic particle effects for fire, fog, and dramatic explosions; and realistic terrain that will reflect battle damage.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Metal Fatigue A Little Strategy, a Few Giant Robots, and a Touch of Anime... by Denny Atkin t takes a lot to stand out in today's real-time strategy arenamore than dropping in a few MECHWARRIOR-style giant robots. The good news is that METAL FATIGUE is more than just COMMAND & CONQUER with giant robots tossed in the mix. An innovative three-level combat arena, a technology salvage system, and a supposed \"rush\"-proof setup should set METAL FATIGUE apart from the crowd. HEAD FOR THE HILLS Moving your ComBot units to higher vantage points gives them better fire coverage and a wider view of the battlefield. Close Com-bots METAL FATIGUE's anime-inspired story takes place in the everpopular 23rd century. The opening cinematic introduces three brothers who encounter an alien robot. After they defeat the robot, a struggle ensues for control of the robot's technology The brothers split, and each goes to work for a different CorpoNation that is attempting to gain control of technology on the abandoned alien planet of Hedoth Prime. Each CorpoNation has acquired various alien technologies, and the game's three forces will be equipped with distinct weaponry. The basic equipment is similareach side has tanks and other small vehicles, but the powerhouse forces are giant robots called ComBots. While each side has certain advantages, there's a way to even ABOVE AND BELOW In addition to things out. If you take the main battlefield, you'll be able down an enemy robot to send units into subterranean without destroying it, you caverns or onto cramped asteroids can salvage its parts and floating above the planet. use them on your own Genre: Real-time Sci-Fi ComBots. Release Date: Q2 '99 In fact, Developer: Zono salvage Publisher: Psygnosis plays such a www.psygnosis major part of the strategy in this game that you can equip your ComBots with weapons that are designed not to destroy, but rather to amputate. If you see a ComBot toting an attractive weapon, you can tell your unit to holster its long-range missiles and move in to attack with a giant ax or buzz saw. The animations on close combat are superb, much like a miniature 3D fighting game. Ironically, your own weapons technologies are the ones your units are most vulnerable to, so you'll want to do your best to keep the enemy from capturing those technologies. Third Floor: Toys, Hardware, and Asteroids METAL FATIGUE's missions play out on a planetary terrain that's 3D in more ways than one. The primary planetary surface battlefield features hills and valleys, and terrain elevation offers significant sighting and range benefits. Where METAL FATIGUE differs from similar games is its inclusion of two more levels: orbital asteroids and a subterranean level. The asteroids make for very cramped battlegrounds, but the real challenge comes in the underground catacomb levels. The cramped environs keep you from taking your giant robots down below, so WATCH YOUR STEP! Tanks can easily end up as so much cannon fodder for giant robots, but they'll come in very handy when the war goes into caverns that are too cramped for the big guys. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 143 "


"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES this will be your chance to make use of the rest of your force mix (which is otherwise pretty much cannon fodder for the ComBots). Drill through to a cavern under your enemy, build an elevator shaft, and you can bring your units right up into the center of an enemy camp. But be warned-elevators are considered neutral resources, and the enemy can just as easily take the elevator down to attack your subterranean forces. One interesting feature in the game and one that should be welcome to multiplayer veterans—is the \"prebuild\" mode at the start of a mission. Each side will be able to set up a fully functional base before the mission starts. Although you'll want to expand these bases, they should have strong enough defenses to fend off tank rush-type tactics once the game starts. Missions will fall into three campaigns, one from the vantage point of each brother. The game's Al is being developed by Mark Baldwin of EMPIRE and PERFECT GENERAL fame. The computercontrolled generals will feature a number of distinct personalities, which Psygnosis hopes will help add replay value. The Neuropa CorpoNation may feature an aggressive, militant leader in one game, but the next time around you may face a general who concentrates on hoarding resources and building up forces before attacking. Backed by impressive hardware 3D graphics and the talents of a veteran Al programmer, METAL FATIGUE is an intriguing design.

As in the original, each merc has a personality, and getting the right chemistry in your band of hopefuls is just as important as picking the guy (or gal) with the best stealth or markmanship skill. Pick carefully, however: Some mercs come with a high price tag, and you have to make money with each mission or your organization won't stay solvent. MY A.I.M. IS TRUE The world of JAGGED ALLIANCE II is now high-tech, which means that you find your operatives on secret Internet sites. Combat in JA2 is even more like that of X-COM: UFO DEFENSE than ever (a good thing), as it goes from real-time strategic to turn-based tactical once an enemy is sighted. NIGHT ON THE TOWN Mercs can now run, climb, Nighttime actions emphasize and crawl-all moves feastealth and offer a nice turing plenty of animated change of pace. SVGA frames, a far cry from the VGA of the original JAGGED ALLIANCE. The role-playing aspects, one of the main enjoyments of JA, are more fleshed out this time around. In addition to watching your mercs improve their stats-or groaning when a merc you've nurtured for several missions goes down for the count-you have to deal with the local populace, who may either betray you or help you (provided that you remember to bring the letter from their cousin in America) From what we've seen so far, the campaign looks like it could be better than that of the first game. And when you've exhausted your solo replay options, you can outfit squads and take them online to out-covert your mercenary-inclined buddies. —Terry Coleman EXCAVATE THIS!

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Braveheart Kilts, Battle Axes, Evil Englishmen, but No Mel Gibson Glasu ormerly known as TARTAN ARMY, BRAVEHEART has a brand new movie license and some seriously ambitious design plans. If the designers can pull it off, this might be the first game with a movie license that actually doesn't suck. A lot of that promise lies in the fact that BRAVEHEART isn't concerned with trying to re-create or rehash a movie-the focus from the get-go has been on compelling gameplay. You play as a Scottish clan leader in the Dark Ages. With the country's clans torn apart by rivalries and everyone under the cruel thumb of the English, your path to victory lies one of three ways: conquer all the clans, win over enough allies to force a vote and ascend to the throne, or drive those stinking Englishmen off your island. The battle portions of the game are reminiscent of MYTH, with a swooping camera taking in the carnage. The free-moving perspective is even more expansive than in MYTH, zooming out for a distant bird's-eye view or all the way in to the first-person view of your leader. The game promises to render the fields of war in full 3D, and they should be stunning. Red Lemon is shooting to create battles with literally thousands of animated polygonal units, including swordsmen, archers, ladder brigades for scaling walls, catapults, and more. The mayhem should be even more remarkable with the planned weather effects-imagine all those men fighting in a driving rain, slipping and falling in the mud, their war machines mired in muck. The use of formations should add a bit of order to this chaos. Troops in BRAVEHEART can be ordered to form lines, wedges, circles, and more. This will allow you to set a wall of pikemen in front of charging English cavalry or to put a protective circle of axemen around more vulnerable YEN units. Unit facing will also play a part in determining your success, with units delivering considerably more damage when attacking their enemy's flank or rear. As compelling as the battle sequences will be, there is an additional, larger scale level of strategy to the game as well. Operating from a map of Scotland, aspiring William Wallaces will have to manage their growing number of clans, set supply lines, conduct research, create and move armies, and juggle diplomatic relations. True to the time, the diplomacy model in the game will encourage deceit and backstabbing, even to the extent that leaders can be bribed in the midst of a battle to switch allegiances. Even with these features, there are two more things we hope to see: a save option for the epic multiplayer games; and the ability to fight in Genre: Real-time Historical battle as your leader, not just see through Release Date: Q4 '99 his eyes. In any event, this is an ambitious Developer: Red Lemon game with real promise. We hope Publisher: Eidos Interactive BRAVEHEART's reach won't exceed its grasp. www.redlemon.com Robert Coffey Point of Attack 2 HPS Returns to Its Modern Roots Setia Amor New Wespent Site f the few genuine independents left in the computer gaming industry, no company has stayed more true to its roots than HPS Simulations, publisher of games so realistic and detailed that they can make Talon Soft's BATTLEGROUND series seem abstract. POINT OF ATTACK 2 marks a welcome return to the type of modern-era wargame that gave HPS its start with the expected database of several thousand weapons from the U.S., Soviet, Chinese, French, British, German, and North Korean arsenals, among others. The scale seems appropriate, at 100 meters to a hex, with oneminute turns. If you don't like the scale, you can adjust it. POINT OF ATTACK 2 will also include weapon and ammunition editors, so you can create \"what if\" high-tech weapons, such as energy weapons. Everything, including the map and scenario editors, should be easier to use than in the original POINT OF ATTACK since the new version has been coded specifically for Windows 95/98. HPS claims that the penetration calculations will be \"the most realistic ever portrayed in a combat simulation.\" Given that the algorithms take into account such minutiae as the air-drag coefficient of each projectile, penetrator hardness, explosive yield strength, slope of defending armor, and even the ogive angle of the projectile's nose cone, we're in no hurry to argue. -Terry Coleman 180° DA Genre: Turn-based Modern Release Date: Q2 '99 Developerl Publisher: Aedle det HPS Simulations This <Facing Len www.HPSsims.com 1 Corolla w bred on o rd www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Warzone 2100 Don't Just Build Your Forces, Design Them The Generation of Extreme Control W ith every real-time strategy title scrambling to find some way to V V distinguish itself, WARZONE 2100 has left it to the player to make the game unique. How? By letting gamers themselves custom design their own combat forces. WARZONE 2100 doesn't veer too far from the tried and true in terms of core gameplay-gamers still must explore, find energy resources, research technology, and build units for combat. But when it comes to the units themselves, well, that's where things get different. As gamers acquire technology, they can set out on various research paths to upgrade and develop their forces. Using that research, gamers will be able to construct their units Genre: Real-time Sci-Fi through a three-step design interface. By choosing Release Date: Q1 '99 which type of turret, body type, and propulsion source Developer: Pumpkin Studios to use in a vehicle, gamers can build the units they Publisher: Eidos Interactive think will be best suited for the mission at hand. With about 400 options from which to choose, gamers will www.eidosinteractive.com have thousands of possibilities. Fortunately, since you'll be able to delete any obsolete designs, you won't have to pick through hundreds of options each time you build a unit. While individual design characteristics will greatly determine a unit's effectiveness, experience will play a part as well. Vehicles will carry over from one mission to the next, gaining experience that will make them perform more efficiently. If you take care of your units, you'll be able to put together a skilled, deadly fighting force after just a handful of scenarios. This persistent world quality spills over to other parts of WARZONE 2100. Instead of presenting the gamer with a new map for each mission, the game expands the original map in range. Thus, your base must be developed and protected through a series of missions. This doesn't mean you'll be stuck with the same map throughout the game, however: There will be 38 missions spread across 3 campaigns taking place in valleys, mountains, and ravaged cities. Not surprisingly, WARZONE 2100 has jumped aboard the 3D bandwagon and will feature true 3D terrain and vehicles. Elevation will affect combat effectiveness, with higher units having a decided advantage over forces on lower ground. To keep track of units and battles, gamers will use a free moving camera that can pan in any direction and zoom. The effect is similar to that of MYTH but is somewhat more intuitive. With the custom unit design, multiplayer matches promise to be interesting. Pumpkin Studios plans to support multiplayer games of up to eight gamers over LAN or Internet and is also working on creating a built-in ranking system. All in all, WARZONE 2100 is an ambitious product. Whether it can fulfill its ambitions remains to be seen.-Robert Coffey Rechnology. The Quick Shotsainiere trademark of Quicksietateve te Rex 700.

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Star Trek: New Worlds Star Trek Enters the Real-time Neutral Zone If I'm sorely in need of a Mr. Spock fix, I need go no farther than my local pharmacy. There I can wander like a drugged Andorian, blissfully picking up Star Trek paperback novels, Star Trek BandAids, Star Trek vitamins, Star Trek videos (with more than a minute of original footage never before seen on TV!), and my favoriteStar Trek toilet tissue. Given the franchise's expansion into every universe imaginable in the past three decades, it's hardly a surprise to see a Trek spinoff in the real-time strategy gaming genre. The folks at Interplay are being highly secretive Genre: Real-time Sci-Fi about STAR TREK: NEW WORLDS, but in between the Release Date: Q2 '99 usual buzzwords such as \"total interaction\" and Developer: Binary Asylum \"uniquely immersive,\" our Tholian spies have discovered a few facts. The 3D environment does look Publisher: Interplay nice, with colorful explosions. Even at this early www.interplay.com stage, the combat strives for that Trek feel, as the ground units hover above the surface and maneuver like land-based starships. All the races from the series have the toys you'd expect: Romulan Cloaking Tanks, Klingon Mobile Disruptor Batteries, and Phaser Tanks for the Federation folks. (At press time it's not clear to us whether you'll first have to try to talk your enemies to death before shooting them.) Other touches include tricorder readings for your strategic map, hydroponics facilities to build, and the like. While STAR TREK: NEW WORLDS supports multiplayer action, we're guessing that the mission-based campaigns-full of exploration, planetary exploitation, and bad blood-could make this the game that OUTPOST II should have been with Trek flavor to boot. -Terry Coleman A NTAL Cena Fantasy War Sony Goes Into Battle Online Hea KHOE Sikha 24u META TWINS Tils were tres Dus water W hile it is turn-based, FANTASY WAR isn't V simply a rehash of WARLORDS III or HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC II. It's a charming online-only design crammed full of idiosyncrasies. You can, for example, render one of your opponent's leaders \"indisposed\" for the turn, leaving you free to move an occupying army into one of his minor allies' territories. Genre: Turn-based Fantasy Play involves up to seven would-be conquerors issuRelease Date: Q4 '98 ing orders for troop movements, spell-casting, hero Developer: Crossover recruitment, and the like.

In this way, gamers should be spared the usual turn-based tedium of having to wait several minutes for someone else to move. w The simple mechanics encourage fast play. The designers even plan to have a blitz game in which the time limit will be about three minutes per turn: You'll have to prioritize your moves because you just won't have time to do everything once many nas forces are on the map. For those who like to ponder all the strategic alternatives, however, there is an epic game as well, which resembles a play-by-email game. Combat is brisk, comprising three rounds: ranged attack, any attempts to flank the opponent, and final melee. Morale is a big part, and armies may break and run before losing all their troops-a nice change from the \"fight to the last Orc\" so prevalent in many recent strategy games. Economics play a big part in FANTASY WAR as well, but it doesn't seem particularly complicated during play. Even in this early stage, this is one of the most promising online games we've seen in awhile. -Terry Coleman Machines Do-It-Yourself Warfare f the lousy pathfinding and I imprecise unit response of other real-time games has just about driven you away from the genre, you may want to give MACHINES a look when it ships this spring. MACHINES lets you command your forces from both an isometric third-person perspective and a free-roaming, ground-level view, but it will also let you jump into any of your units to steer Genre: Real-time Sci-Fi it, aim it, and fire it. Perfect for missions requiring Release Date: Q2 '99 precise maneuvering, this feature will let you guide vital units deep into enemy bases-dodging defenDeveloper: Charybdis sive fire--and actually enter enemy facilities to steal Publisher: Acclaim or sabotage technology. Strategists who fear they www.acclaimnation.com lack the twitch reflexes necessary to pull this off can rest assured that missions will be designed so that you can also win without having to personally guide your forces. As the sentient machines slug it out across a series of planets in 30 branching missions, you will have to seek out upgrades for your forces. Hardware upgrades for the 18 basic machines should pump the unit total up to about 50; software upgrades will increase your scanner range, improve your weapons' firing distance, and make your \"unmanned\" machines smarter by improving their pathfinding. Night vision upgrades will be vital since the gameworld will cycle through day and night. All of this will be delivered in, what else, glorious 3D, with hardware acceleration required for the game's 3D terrain, the fully polygonal units, and the dynamic lighting and environment effects. -Robert Coffey de 158 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"THE NEW WAVE OF STRATEGY GAMES Roller Coaster Tycoon And Now for Something Completely Different As a rule, roller coaster games put me off my feed because A they tend to remind me of that horrid Disney wire-frame game of a few years ago. Really, it was more like a CAD program masquerading as a roller coaster game. Well, I'm happy to report that my appetite is quite healthy after spending time looping around in ROLLER COASTER TYCOON. If the title reminds you of MicroProse's TRANSPORT TYCOON, it should: Both games are by designer Chris Sawyer. The difference is that ROLLER COASTER TYCOON never stops being fun. It's a lot like SIMCITY, in that you can keep designing death-defying rides without paying attention to the campaign game-which has a lot of depth-as you research and develop new rides. Simultaneously, you try to keep your customers happy and turn a profit. In fact, the game reminds me a bit of the old THEME PARK, except that it's better looking and a lot easier to play-something the producer proved to me by constructing a towering roller coaster in less than 10 minutes, complete with squealing teenagers and people staggering off the Genre: Real-time Carnival ride, tossing their cookies. Release Date: Q2 '99 We're always asking for something dif Developer: Chris Sawyer ferent, and ROLLER COASTER TYCOON Publisher: Hasbro/MicroProse should definitely fit the bill-just bring www.microprose.com your own cotton candy. -Terry Coleman Long Ago and Far Away Remakes, Secret Projects, and Rumors N ot only are Gary Grigsby and Keith Brors frantically trying to finish up the epic BATTLE OF BRITAIN for TalonSoft (see our \"Holiday Hot 100\" in last month's issue), they are also underway on STEEL PANTHERS IV. Could this be the title that returns the famed series to the forefront of modern-era strategy games? From what we've seen, the gameplay will be very tactical to the point where you can control individual tanks. But we're a bit skeptical about SSI's claims that on maximum zoom, one pixel on your screen will equal four inches of real terrain. A new, more accessible interface and point-to-point movement are welcome changes to the design, and the team insists that \"unit movement is more dependent upon battlefield conditions than an artificial turn system.\" Sounds a lot like the initiative-based system used in ACHTUNG! SPITFIRE, which would be fine by us. In any case, don't expect STEEL PANTHERS IV until late 1999. history: The Pacific version of OVER THE REICH is in limbo, and Big Time Software has turned to COMBAT MISSION (see page 127 in this issue). GUADALCANAL IS MIA as well, but designer Steve Magestro has formed his own company, Rebel Interactive. While Magestro is being somewhat sparse on details, there's a good likelihood given his history, that he's working on a Pacific-theater WWII game You can ask him yourself at www.reblactive.@aol.com. FREEDOM IN THE GALAXY (which graybeards will remember as an ancient SPI boardgame), adapted for the PC by MicroProse veteran Jim Synofski looks to be down for the count as well. What's Up With, AH, Hasbro? Well, it looks as though the absorption of Avalon Hill by the Boston Borg is turning out better than anyone had a right to hope. Bill Levay, former head of computer game development for Avalon Hill, has evidently accepted a position with Hasbro for the express purpose of determining which AH games can be easily adapted to the computer. Being a large public company, Hasbro has no official comment on which AH titles might be first in the queue. However, given the obsession of several Hasbro designers with DIPLOMACY and HISTORY OF THE WORLD, don't HISTORY OF THE WORLD be surprised to see new and improved PC versions of those titles in the next 18 months—maybe sooner if Hasbro's AXIS & ALLIES is a hit (see our review on page 358). On the other hand, it seems that all the AH computer projects that were in development at the time of the Hasbro acquisition are now Other Titles on the Horizon The acquisition of Virgin has left a lot of projects in the lurch there as well. Strategy First, however, is still working on MAN OF WAR II which sports much better 3D than the original Expect this sequel in the spring of 1999. We can't be so sure about ROAD TO MOSCOW, saved from purgatory by Interactive Magic The game certainly looks better (and more playable) than it did more than a year ago, but ROAD TO MOSCOW is such an ambitious project the entire Russian Front of WWII with detailed supply and Al down to company level-that it could be several months before small details like play balance are ready for the marketplace MALKARI, another I-Magic title, tries to be a tonque in cheek SEVEN KINGDOMS light, complete with Aztec priests casting spells of doom on incredulous conquistadors. The big question with this real-time New World game is whether the graphics-at this point, looking very 1996can be brought up to speed by the Eastern European developer in time for this game to compete. The SSG folks are still busy with REACH FOR THE STARS for Microsoft, now slated for the summer of 1999. But they've also quietly begun work on WARLORDS IV for The Learning Company/ SSI/Red Orb/Whomever. It's likely that this next game in the classic series will not be simultaneous turn-based.

For Alan Patmore of Surreal Software, developers of the upcoming DRAKAN, it came from a lifelong fascination with fantasy fiction and a strong desire to work on a fantasy game. Flying through an early demo using Surreal's technology, Patmore suddenly thought, \"Wouldn't it be cool if you could fly around as a dragon, frying little warriors and eating maidens?\" From that point, DRAKAN evolved first as a realtime strategy game before coming together as a shooter with a The Blood, Sweat, and Tears of Blood, Guns, and Speed [by Robert Coffey) eep down inside, it's just ugly. Creative constraints. Budget constraints. Time constraints. Technical constraints. While fans may see the business of making games as exciting-even glamorousdesigners know that the actual process of building a thrill-asecond action game is more concerned with solving problems day after day: What will make our game unique? What engine will best suit our needs? Do we need to recode any part so it works better for us? How do we approach multiplayer? What are our competitors doing and how do we respond? Decisions, countless thousands of them. It's a long, tortuous path with stumbling blocks every step of the way. Even an absolute, bottom-ofthe-barrel game like NAM is shaped by a seemingly endless litany of decisions. Obviously, in NAM's case they were the wrong decisions, but they had to be made nonetheless. Besides, making the right decisions is no guarantee for success-witness BATTLEZONE, one of the best games of 1998, but one of the year's least impressive sellers. \" What is a car? What is an object?

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME  ACTION THE VISION THING « You get enough testers who have a knack for going to the most unlikely places in a level. wo break away from the pack of copycat action games, a title needs to find a way to capture gamers' attention. One thing that makes a game stand go and parted ways. Monolith CEO Jason Hall explains his company's decision to develop its own engine this way: \"In order to deliver a compelling experience with SHOGO, we needed the speed of QUAKE II, the beauty of an UNREAL renderer, and something that had never been done quite right before an incredible debris and particle system. All this needed to be integrated into one continuous, flexible, easy-to-use system that could be expanded upon for years to come.\" Currently being used by more than 7,000 developers, LithTech seems to be a real contender in the engine wars. Still, Romero doubts that any one engine will ever dominate the industry because new engines are constantly on the way, with aggressive license pricing and more features. \"Technology,\" he warns, \"keeps marching on!\" (Brandon James. id Software) Pest Control Sloppy coding and buggy products are the bane of any gamer. Despite the assertions of a few Usenet cranks, designers care about their products and don't want to put their names on a buggy game. But according to Andrew Goldman, president and CEO of Pandemic Studios, the team behind BATTLEZONE and the upcoming BATTLEZONE 2, bugs are basically inevitable and often stem from trying to accommodate a wide range of hardware, particularly 3D cards. \"Remember the dark days of sound cards?\" asks Goldman. \"There was always some sort of conflict that would mess with your life. Now it seems we're in the dark period of 3D cards. Every card supports different features and is constantly getting updated drivers. If you own a Voodoo Rush card, odds are you're nodding in agreement right about now. To squash bugs before they get in the box, designers subject their games to stringent quality assurance (QA) testing as well as beta testing. Activision will have up to 100 testers during any given beta cycle, with QA testing lasting in excess of four months. At Valve, QA starts at the beginning of a project to catch bugs the moment they occur. Valve uses its beta phase principally to detect unexpected configuration problems. Id Software uses outside testers to catch bugs that its rigorous, inhouse testing doesn't catch. Brandon James, an id level designer explains, \"Everybody out there has a different and distinct playing style. You get enough (testers) who have a knack for going to the most unlikely places in a level and doing the most obscure things and eventually you'll have covered all the paths and areas that an average player will follow.\" Across the board, designers seem to take the input of their testers seriously, implementing suggestions and changes every step of the way. Goldman observes, \"After spending two years on a project you're no longer able to see how new users will react to the product. The only way to maintain an appropriate perspective is to learn to look at it through the eyes of your first-time users.\" Those users provide invaluable feedback. The input of BATTLEZONE testers led to fullworld minimaps, the refinement of the game's outstanding interface (see the \"Control Issues\" sidebar), and the deletion of a virtual cockpit. In the case of HALFLIFE, implemented suggestions from testers ran the gamut from \"Make this ladder more obvious\" to \"This monster really sucks and needs to be redesigned.\" When bugs do occur in a game, every designer to a man wants to out is a strong, clear, conceptual identity. That's what made INTERSTATE '76 such a breath of fresh air: Its car combat came packaged in a highly stylized, funky, funny 1970s wrapper. According to Zack Norman, \"Any game design should be encapsulated in one to three sentences. Every design element should be compared against that ideal. INTERSTATE '76 was '70s muscle cars with guns: Mad Max meets Shaft. INTERSTATE '82 is Mad Max meets Miami Vice.\" Every creative decision is then filtered through the game's concept summary with the intention of creating a unified creative whole. With this philosophy in place, certain design choices almost decide themselves. The widely praised funk soundtrack in INTERSTATE '76 was used because funk had the energy appropriate for an action game, even though it wasn't the most popular music of that time. The same holds true for INTERSTATE '82 and its New Wave soundtrack. Featuring elements of Madness-type ska and B-52s-style surf music, the soundtrack meets the criteria set by the game's capsule concept. -100 L507 902 COMPROMISING POSITION The Star Trek license brings instant consumer recognition, but at a creative cost. While the KLINGON HONOR GUARD designers could persuade Paramount to allow the blood seen in this shot, the studio categorically ruled out gibs. 172 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 www.com .com "


"ACTION BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME fix them. Most designers follow the procedure that Monolith used for SHOGO: Immediately trying to fix any problem and post a patch on the company's Web site. But Zack Norman sounds a cautionary note: \"The harsh realities of corporate America don't necessarily mean we can issue a patch. If a game has no shelf life, if no one's buying it, it's hard to rationalize the time and expense of releasing a patch.\" ing to sell a game to retailers and you present them with Star Trek and Game XYZ, it's easier to sell the Star Trek game since the retailer knows what Star Trek is. Another big benefit of having a licensed product is cross-promotion.\" Licensing a known entity does come with limitations, however. DeLucia again: \"Obviously, you have to deal with the specific characters and back-story. Things like the color of a character's costume or their actions and attitude are very specific and, in most cases, must be strictly followed. Plus, your audience is intimately familiar with the subject matter and any inconsistencies will be noticed.\" Considering the rabid nature of some Star Trek fans, that's an understatement. Forced to work inside the frame work of the license, designers make concessions that would not be nec essary in an original title. In the case of KLINGON HONOR GUARD, MicroProse was forbidden to use gibs and had to demonstrate the need to show blood. On the other hand, a license might backfire on a game. In the case of BATTLEZONE, the license helped the design team focus on some early aspects of development and helped to get out initial word about the title. But in the end between naming the game after an 18-year-old coin-op game and putting dated vector-graphic images on the box-Goldman feels that the BATTLEZONE name just created confusion that hurt sales. compete. Where a shooter could previously get by with a few paragraphs of generic text between chunks of levels, gamers now expect a more complete experience. And they're starting to get it. Nowhere is this experience delivered more compellingly than in the soon-to-be-released HALFLIFE, which found its inspiration in a Stephen King novella, The Mist. while almost all of the original concept has vanished from the final product, the focus on storytelling has not. Through scripted scenes that occur around the player, immersive action elements that push the plot forward while serving up a steady stream of fresh challenges, and an imaginative, almost cinematic approach to every facet of gameplay, HALF-LIFE makes its story an integral part of the game instead of the excuse for it. Hunting Licenses To avoid a quick death on the shelves a title must stand out, and one way to accomplish that is to license a known entity. The idea is that the consumer will be more inclined to buy something they're familiar with and, hopefully, already like. Alex Delucia, producer of MicroProse's KLINGON HONOR GUARD explains, \"When you're tryEvery Bloody Picture Tells a Story Increasingly, it seems, action games will have to tell a story to BUILDING CHARACTER DS ame characters don't develop overnight. The sequence above illustrates how the body style of Rynn, the protagonist of DRAKAN, evolved. The first model, with its very low polygon count, was ideal for testing, if not for gameplay. The second Rynn served as the foundation for the later versions. She has a slightly higher polygon count but was a little too buff and unfeminine. The third one is the anorexic Rynn. Surreal was aiming for a lean athletic look, but found this version too waifish. Her legs were also far too long, which interfered with some of her fighting moves. The final model is the one used in the game. The right height, weight, and polygon count, she fits the character personality and is much more attractive than previous versions. At top and left are the skins for Rynn and her dragon companion, Arokh. These skins use multiple highquality texture maps to get higher pixel density than in other games, which generally use single-texture maps to create skins. The skins are then applied to the models using Surreal's proprietary texture-mapping tool and, voilà, a character is born. www.com .cn COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 173 "

"JILDING THE PERFECT GAME ACTION In order to put the pieces together, Valve dealt with countless challenges. How do you make animations small enough that the gamer won't need 256MB of RAM to run them? How do you tell a story without taking control away from the gamer? How do you ensure that all the thousands of little details support the story you're telling? \"The answer,\" says Gabe Newell, \"is a mixture of up front design, careful choices on the creative side to live within the envelope of what was possible from our engine...and a lot of really late nights.\" It's a daunting task but if it's all done right, as it is in HALF-LIFE, the results can be incredible. for multiplayer action presents a whole different set of problems. Brandon James of id's QUAKE III: ARENA team explains, \"Our biggest hurdle is to keep the game challenging while trying to give players an equal chance in the match. Balancing out the experiences, effects, pluses and minuses, as well as introducing new weapons, power-ups, and items is necessary to keep a player's interest high.\" With the QUAKE line moving toward a solely multiplayer game, the id team is focusing more on fighting, survival, and the hunter/ hunted aspect of multiplayer gaming than the combat-driven singleplayer experience. For QUAKE III, id is breaking down the DeathMatch experience and levels into distinct styles. Some arenas will accommodate larger numbers of gamers while others will suit more one-on-one combat. According to id level designer Tim Willits, \"Flow, identifiable areas, freedom of movement, giving or not giving a player control of the level, and multiple entrances and exits to the main arteries or combat areas—all these elements play a role in creating a level that's fair and balanced.\" While these challenges are common in designing multiplayer games for first-person shooters, other games face far different problems. In making the multiplayer components for DRAKAN, Surreal first had to deal with scale, and had to scale back the scope of its multiplayer levels in a nod to playability. The second challenge was to figure out how to enable DRAKAN's mix of projectile-based air combat and hand-to-hand ground combat. Again, the smaller levels helped, and the design team found that creating maps for specific multiplayer variations further enhanced multiplayer gameplay. The Whole Enchilada From the initial idea to the last patch posted on the Internet, designing action games is an almost ceaseless process of recognizing and defeating obstacles. In a sense, the design process isn't all that different from playing a shooter: See the problem, blow it away. Make the right decisions and you can wind up with a classic like QUAKE or you can revolutionize the genre, as with HALF-LIFE. Make the wrong choices, fail to balance multiplayer, or design an interface that requires a prehensile tongue to use effectively, and you'll wind up gibbed by the competition. You Always Kill the Ones You Love Ever since DOOM, action titles have all but been required to provide multiplayer options. Designing After playing MIGHT & MAGIC VI for what feels like the past 15 years, Robert Coffey is looking forward to playing a game where he just shoots things. CONTROL ISSUES he interface is everything in gameplay. A player needs to be able to sit down in front of the game and start to play without confusion.\" So says Andrew Goldman, president and CEO of Pandemic Studios, the creators of BATTLEZONE and the upcoming BATTLEZONE 2. Goldman knows how important the interface is to overall design, and his games prove it: The interface in BATTLEZONE was easily one of the design highlights of the past year. Seamless and intuitive, it let the gamer immerse himself in gameplay without wrestling with the controls. But BATTLEZONE's interface wasn't always so slick. Initially, the game featured a split inter face; you commanded from an overhead view and then fought in first-person perspective. The designers soon learned that it made BATTLEZONE feel like two different games instead of the action/strategy hybrid it was meant to be, and they set out to fix it. The integration of the topographical map and the command menus proved to be the key breakthrough. Still more changes occurred over the course of a year-long string of beta testing. As Goldman explains, \"As soon as you start to make changes, everything goes out the window. The only way you'll know if new interface ideas work is by putting players in front of a working prototype.\" Working on BATTLEZONE's sequel has charged the design team to make the interface even friendlier looking and less intimidating. They are focusing principally on decreasing the amount of keyboard gymnastics required to control units and letting the mouse do more of the work. The bottom line is simple: An interface can make or break a game. If it's more of an obstacle than a tool, that game had better also be giving you back rubs and cooking you gourmet meals every night if the publisher hopes to make any profit.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME SIMULATIONS CRASH COURSE light simulations are arguably the most complex of all computer games to create. Where the simple existence of gravity or momentum passes for \"real physics\" in some game genres, flight-sim designers face a demanding audience that knows not only how real planes fly, but also how real pilots fly them. But designing a sim isn't just about maximum realism. An authentic World War Il sim might have you flying 10-hour missions and finishing a three-month career with only three kills. While there's a niche market that would love that experience, that's not the game most sim players are looking for. And for every sim fanatic who's looking for the maximum in realism, there's a newbie sim player that game designers want to turn into a fan. This gamer needs a plane that's easy to get into without a trip to the local airport for flying lessons. So how do designers balance these demands for playability, accessibility, and realism? make a compelling mission environment in which to play the game. Enemies that work together to defeat you, unexpected subtleties, and plausible reactions to anything the player does. Basically you have to build a commercialgrade military simulator and a great game all at once. Oh, and did I mention the challenges of Internet multiplayer gaming for a realistic combat sim?\" It's enough to make a fledgling sim designer decide that curing the common cold might be easier. Paul Grace, whose projects include CHUCK YEAGER'S AIR COMBAT, the U.S. NAVY FIGHTERS series, and JANE'S WWII FIGHTERS, concurs. Building a Flight Sim Shouldn't Be So Tough: You're Just Re-creating Reality... [by Denny Atkin) Flight Planning \"I truly believe that highly realistic sims are the most difficult of all games to build, from an engineering standpoint (with the possible exception of massively multiplayer persistent state worlds like ULTIMA ONLINE).\" says Andy Hollis, who is best known for his Origin Skunkworks projects, the award-winning JANE'S LONGBOW series, and F-15. Hollis has been creating sims since the days of the Atari 800. Hollis outlines the complexities: \"First, you have to build a complete simulation of a real airplane. Geez, the Defense Department spends millions on this. And it better be right, or the customers will complain. Then, you have to build a photorealistic graphics environment in which to fly the thing. And it must work well up high from a distance, and down low and close. You just can't play the same kinds of tricks as you can in a 3D shooter. Finally, you have to 11 Unfortunately, to create a great simulation, a flight model, avionics, enemy Al, and good graphics are only the start.

"SIMULATIONS BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME Labiausios RESTORA zero,' but once you get far away (from your starting point) they may 'grow' farther apart or closer together simply owing to how computations get processed. In some cases you can switch to a higher precision data representation; in other cases you may need to completely recode how the computations are done to prevent the problem.\" In other words, don't quit your day job to develop flight sims if you struggled with high school algebra. HIT BUBBLES This P-38 from FIGHTER DUEL 2 shows the bounding sphere system used to detect which part of an aircraft is hit by bullets. KSINS Blood FLBLBMBOL BB co PUMPS \"I have to agree with Andy,\" Grace says. \"I don't think there is any more demanding piece of entertainment software engineering. The environment is huge, the graphics are trending toward photorealism, the frame-rates increase the gameplay is complex, the sound multivariate, the Al needs to be flexible enough to handle the ebb and flow of combat.\" Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, Grace adds. \"I think that the demanding nature of the software is why the category is popular.\" Matt Shaw and Ted Jump are currently working on FIGHTER DUEL 2, Infogrames' latest entry in a series of World War II games that traces its history back to the heyday of the Amiga. Jump's experience mirrors that of Hollis and Grace. \"In our opinion, flight simulators have many more difficulties than just about any other genre,\" Jump says. \"The program has to represent everything from your cockpit instrumentation two feet in front of your eyes to a mountain range 40 miles away and everything in between. A vast database of terrain data consisting of both height and texture maps must be maintained and delivered quickly for smooth flight.\" And just having the proper data doesn't mean you're going to get it right, Jump says. \"Owing again to the distances that are required to be manipulated, it is easily possible to create software that causes improper behavior or rendering simply because of how floating-point data is handled. Consider two gauges in the instrument panel that may be only centimeters apart. Depending on the computations required to manipulate them in three-dimensional space, they may look and render fine when you are near 'world Preflight Check Of course, the first step in building a flight sim is choosing what you're going to simulate. Recent release trends might make the more conspiracy-minded think that a virtual trilateral commission of flight sim developers gets together and has discussions along the lines of \"Okay. last year we all did F-22 simulations. This time let's all do World War II sims.\" But in fact, the process is a bit more scientific. I asked Andy Hollis how Jane's chooses which platform to simulate. \"We look at a number of factors,\" Hollis says. \"How well-known is the subject aircraft? Clearly an F-15 is more wellknown than an F-4, and Longbows are more well-known worldwide than any other attack helicopter. In order to appeal to a broad market of players, we want to choose high-profile aircraft that everyone agrees are sexy! Niche aircraft usually lose out here.\" So if you've been waiting for that F-105 Thunderchief or Brewster Buffalo sim, it's time to move on. Next, Hollis says, developers ask how interesting is the role of the aircraft? Aircraft that are pure strikers or pure dogfighters provide less variety of experience for the gamer. It's better to have lots of interesting situations to play out. \"Has the aircraft been involved in (or will it potentially be involved in) noteworthy conflicts? For some historical sims, this is the key question to ask, with the sim being focused on multiple aircraft in that conflict,\" Hollis adds. Another consideration when choosing a subject is how much real information is A PHANTOM APPEARS This sequence shows how Origin Skunkworks turned a line drawing into a 3D F-4 Phantom. 20 O G 1 LE www.computorum .

This one is the lowest priority, since we usually don't worry too much about what the competition is doing, but it's not usually a good idea to be building a product based on a concept that has already been beaten to death can you say 'F-22?\" Hollis tends to focus on \"study\" sims, which simulate a single aircraft in great detail. Jane's other development group, headed by Paul Grace, focuses primarily on \"survey\" sims, which simulate a group of aircraft. \"I think there is a bit of a difference when you are building a survey product,\" Grace explains. \"We search for the popularity, the romance, the things that seem fun about flight. We also try to pick things of personal interest, hence naval and strategy simulations, or just some concepts that we might think would work as a simulation.\" OFF THE SHELF Sometimes developers can use off-the-shelf tools in creating sims; KPT Bryce is being used to model land areas in FIGHTER DUEL 2, while aircraft models are built in Lightwave 3D. DESIGNING FOR MULTIPLAYER nce you've flown a flight sim against other humans, it's hard to go back to even the best Al opponents. But right now, designers must consider that the vast majority of flight sim pilots are flying solo against the Al. Of the number of pilots who fly sims multiplayer, Andy Hollis says, \"I'd peg that as less than 20 percent. Of course, they all have Internet access and like to voice their preferences on the Usenet newsgroups.\" Still, that small percentage doesn't mean multiplayer is not a concern for developers. Hollis explains, \"Multiplayer hasn't been fully exploited in combat sims. The potential is huge, but there are engineering challenges to be overcome, especially for the more realistic and comprehensive sims. Jane's Combat.net has been reasonably successful, but we have much bigger plans for that.\" Kit Planes Once the topic is chosen, it's time to dive in and do the research. How were these planes flown, and more importantly, how did these planes fly? Building accurate flight models for sims is an amazingly difficult task no matter what the topic. But when the planes that you're simulating were last used in battle more than 80 years ago, just pinning down their basic performance can be quite a challenge. Jerome Kluth of Dynamix's RED BARON 3D development team said the team had to consult a variety of sources to get a complete set of data on the World War I planes they were simulating. \"Our initial source was our staff historian, John Bruning, and all of the historical literature on the subject we could find, including pilot diaries and autobiographies, as well as books on individual aircraft.\" The team didn't stop after the trips to the library, though. \"TO help put the sometimes colorful descriptions into a more objective form, we used contemporary references, such as Jeff Ethell's pilot reports on various replicas. as well as information from pilots of flying replicas,\" Kluth said. \"Information such as top speeds and climb rates was available for most of the planes, but things such as roll rate, turn rate, and structural limitations were mostly available only in a comparative form. Period films and still photographs of aerial combat gave us some measure of objective data, and using the comparisons as a guide, we started by adjusting the most maneuverable plane and proceeded from there.\" Matt Shaw says the FIGHTER DUEL 2 team had similar challenges with some WWII planes. \"Some aircraft are easy to get flight data on (for example, there Shinden, for example). To get data for the physical models and flight models in FIGHTER DUEL 2, we start by utilizing the vast library of technical data we've been accumulating for the last seven years. That gives us flight performance data as well as aircraft flight idiosyncrasies. Published reports on how well a particular aircraft performs have to be evaluated, as they are often subjective and false recollections years after the fact. Furthermore, field modifications to aircraft were quite common in WWII, sometimes dramatically changing the flight characteristics of a particular aircraft model. The addition of metal ailerons to the Spitfire is a good example of this.\" Sometimes, Shaw says, you've just got to hit the road. \"We've Some are more difficult, and for some, the flight data doesn't exist in any form (the Japanese J7W1 218COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"SIMULATIONS BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME made many trips to National Air and Space Museum Garber facility, which is local to us, as well as the Chino Planes of Fame Museum in California, and museums such as the Duxford Imperial War Museum in England.\" Once a flight model is defined, it's time to put it to the test. And who better to test the planes' performance than the pilots who've flown the real things? Bruce Williams, the lead project planner for Microsoft's COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR, explains some of the flight testing that went into that product. \"We worked closely with pilots from the Confederate Air Force, WWII veterans, and other experts to test and fine-tune the flight models for the various aircraft,\" Williams says. \"Using the same process that we developed for FLIGHT SIMULATOR, we took the software to the pilots, had them try it, and then refined the flight characteristics through an iterative process based on their feedback.\" With historical aircraft, it's still possible to find pilots who had lots of time at the controls of a plane, but much more difficult to find pilots who are actually current in those aircraft. \"Lad Doctor of the Confederate Air Force was very helpful in this process. He is one of the few people alive who is relatively current in the Spitfire, Bf-109, P-47, and P-51. He was not a WWII pilot, but his being very current and analytical was a big benefit for us,\" says Mike Schroeter, flight model designer for COMBAT FLIGHT SIM. With modern planes, finding the information is a bit easier, but it's no less time-intensive. Jane's Andy Hollis says that much of the information for F-15 and Longbow came from visits to active bases and interviews with current pilots. Civilian sims are perhaps the easiest to find a group of enthusiastic, knowledgeable testers for Richard Harvey, the project leader for Terminal Reality's FLY!, says that most of the data for aircraft performance in that sim comes from the aircraft manufacturers and pilot training companies, but that the developers look to actual pilots for much of the testing. \"Of course, one of the best ways to check the data is by having your sim looked at by someone who has actually flown the plane itself. We've been careful to build our initial beta team from a core of real pilots, each with thousands of flight hours in everything from single-prop planes to military and commercial jets.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME SIMULATIONS \" I truly believe that highly realistic sims are the most difficult of all games he is hot on the tail of his own target and distracted. The Al pilots also have a sophisticated target selection model, which leads to effects such as great-looking furballs and bomber attack or escort missions.\" to build. \" (Andy Hollis, JANE'S A-10 WARTHOG] We are using these testers to verify the performance, feel, and accuracy of not only our flight models, but aircraft systems as well.\" Another consideration when developing flight models is that experienced flight-sim players may have different expectations than real pilots. Harvey says, \"We'll be adding sim-heavy testers later in our cycle to give us feedback on Mike McGrath, of the RED BARON 3D development team, says, \"The Al is a fair part of the 'magic' of a simulation like RB3D. it completes the immersion of the simulation by adding other active parties into the single-player game-so along with the sensory stimulation, like the visuals and sounds, it lets your imagination run away a little with the idea of existing in the game's universe making it a more compelling and interesting place to spend time. \"For an Al pilot,\" McGrath continues, \"a great deal of effort must be put into making the Al 'believeable,' in the immersive sense. In addition to being an effective combatant, it has to make mistakes, and it has to be vulnerable. It doesn't have a joystick, or a throttle, but it must behave as though it does.\" Jeremy Stone talks about the elements of COMBAT FLIGHT SIM'S Al that were designed to make it feel \"human\" and alive. \"Al pilots actually operate their controls, and the aircraft is run through a full physics simulation based on the control positions the Al pilots choose. This is a hard problem and very few products do it. The benefit is very realistic aircraft behavior. You'll also see humanlike behavior, such as minor course corrections to stay on course and drifting in formation \"Al pilots have a realistic sighting model,\" Stone adds. \"There's a definite advantage to trying to sneak up on an opponent, particularly in the heat of combat. Factors such as target fixation are also modeled—you'll have an easier time shooting someone down if Mission Critical There are dozens of other factors that go into creating a flight simulation building a graphics engine, mission creations, interface design, and so on. Missions are a critical aspect: Should they be scripted, branching, or part of a computer-generated dynamic campaign? The COMBAT FLIGHT SIM team chose scripted missions because they wanted to re-create historical missions, while the RED BARON 3D team wanted to recreate an unpredictable, dynamic war. Look for details on mission design in my column in next month's CGW. One thing that became evident during the course of researching this article is that it would be hard to cover the development of a flight sim in great detail in 200 pages, much less the limited space of this feature. So look forward to coverage of other parts of the development process in upcoming issues of CGW. INSTANT CANYON For PRO PILOT, the Sierra team created an elevation mesh of the entire United States. The number of polygons in just this small area gives you an idea how much data is required. Denny Atkin has been writing about computer games for 12 years, and yet he's significantly younger than Johnny Wilson. He's currently fighting the Battle of Britian in COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR the 'feel from a sim enthusiasts standpoint, but we want to ensure the simulation is sound and solid before then.\" Pilot Training Once the planes are in place, you need someone to fly them. Unless you're getting in IFR practice for a real pilot's license, flying around alone isn't going to be much fun. So it's up to the flight sim developers to create convincing Al pilots to take the controls of enemy and allied aircraft. 3D REBUILD The long development curve of RED BARON II saw 3D cards rise in prominence before the sim's release. Adding 3D support isn't as easy as some would think-Dynamix spent nearly a year updating the sim to RED BARON 3D. 189 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME SPORTS \"The simple truth is that obsessions just aren't funny, and that obsessives don't laugh. A Never-Ending Design Process \"It's déjà vu all over again. ---Yogi Berra GOING en GOLD -Author Nick Hornby, from the book Fever Pitch, explaining why, as a boy, he had no sense of humor about his soccer fanaticism. FOR THE Developing a Sports Game Takes Brains, Passion—and a Healthy Dose of Masochism [by Jeff Green) hat makes someone a great sports game developer? A knowledge and love of sports, of course. A savvy brain for computer game design. And, maybe most important of all, a serious case of masochism. Why? Because of all the computer game genres, with the possible exception of simulations, sports puts you in the unenviable position of trying to please the world's toughest customer: the know-it-all sports fan. You think we're kidding? Spend a morning listening to sports talk radio. Call up and proclaim, \"Brett Favre is an overrated sissy in a weak division.\" See what kind of response you get. Sports, like politics and religion, engenders a gutlevel, intractable set of emotions, opinions, biases, and theories in those who care and woe be to the person who messes with someone else's sports reality. So imagine being a game developer. It's your job to create an illusion of sports reality-say, a football game--for hundreds of thousands of football fans (and gaming journalists), all of whom think they understand the game better than you do. You want your game to be as realistic as possible, but you also want it to be fun. You want it to be the most comprehensive, definitive game ever on the sport-but your company has given you less than a year in which to make it. No wonder that the great majority of sports games get mediocre to-bad reviews. No wonder that, if you judge by Usenet posts, there's never been a truly great sports game ever. No wonder that company after company thinks it's getting into the sports gaming business, Designing any computer game is hard work, but sports developers have a unique set of problems. For the most part, sports games aren't one-time products, but yearly ones that are constantly in development, and constantly being shoved out the door to correspond with reallife sporting seasons. Unlike a game like PREY, for example, the makers of football, baseball, basketball, and hockey games have just one year to design, produce, and hone their product. They can't just finish it \"when it's done.\" For Ric Neil, producer of EA Sports' MADDEN 99, the process is thus simultaneously fast and never-ending. \"We never stop working on the game,\" says Neil. \"In reality, as soon as we finish the current game we start working on next year's version. Because we have to get the product done every year, we do not have the luxury of starting from scratch.\" Think of the process, then, as less like a straight line and more like a circle perhaps even a race track-with the game constantly spinning around, trying to stay ahead of its competitors, checking in regularly into the pit for updates, technological improvements, bug fixes, and, in some cases, wholesale rewrites. Mike Branham, director of Sierra Sports NFL FOOTBALL PRO 99, describes the process this way: \"We start each version with the previous product's design spec as an alpha spec. Then input for changes and new features get kicked around and tossed in. Then we do a time analysis on the new spec with the changes and new features. Some get killed, but for the rest, we staff the project and get to work.\" Working on an existing product can be seen as both an advantage (especially if the game is already a good one) and a disadvantage, [Wireframe model from Sierra's FOOTBALL PRO 99) only to give up some time before or after its first product is released. Even Microsoft, with all its resources, is having trouble getting sports games developed right now. How do sports developers cope with it all? We caught up with some of the biggest names in sports gaming, including the folks behind MADDEN, NASCAR RACING, and JACK NICKLAUS, to share with us the joys and headaches of their jobs, and spill some of the secrets of game design. 192 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

AH, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT A work-inprogress shot from FIFA 99, showing players' heads tilting up to watch a ball in flight. because, given the time constraints, you're largely stuck with what you have.

Mike Franco, the executive producer of JACK NICKLAUS: GOLDEN those items are always the first to go into the design for the next product. Since we have a version out there that computer golfers are playing, we listen to what they like and what they wish they had.\" Most designers seemed to agree, however, that no matter a year's worth of development. We start (each year] by taking a fresh look at the gaming market in general to look for trends and design improvements in other genres.\" Franco agreed. \"I actually think the attitude toward a sequel is between refining and starting from scratch. We can't ignore existing users, so we don't start from scratch. However, simply refining last year's product will never do in a highly competitive environment like computer golf.\" But no matter how lofty your goals, there is the grim reality of the ticking clock, and the fact that missing a few weeks off the schedule probably means that your game will never ship. This is why the game the consumer ends up with usually isn't quite as ambitious, and doesn't have quite as many features, as the product first described in those glowing sneak previews written six months before the game's completion. \"There are a lot of people in the process,\" said Sierra's Branham. \"Development, art, marketing, PR, and management. Various items in the 'wish list' are more or less important to different groups, and a lot of culling and adding happen when these groups get together. In the end, the time and schedule analysis will lock the feature set.\" Ric Neil at EA perhaps put it best: \"The programmers and artists get frustrated with us because we always want more in the game than they can do in a single year. The wish list is a constantly changing document and it grows as every version ships.\" \"We learned the hard way that a game must be designed and developed with multiplayer in mind (Vance Cook.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME SPORTS DOX Trophy Bass 3 D Fishing NAGAGAWon REF DREAM PRODUCTS We asked each designer we interviewed to describe to us the \"dream\" version of their product. Here are some of the responses where to cut corners in order to improve gameplay. \"Too much realism can cause some problems,\" said MADDEN'S Neil. \"For example, in the NFL, there are usually about one-and-ahalf to three minutes in between plays as the players get back to the huddle, and back to action; it would be kinda boring if we put that in the game. We try to keep the fun factor as high as possible without losing too much realism. That is one of the things that makes MADDEN, MADDEN.\" Vance Cook, the designer of Sierra Sports' PGA CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF 1999 EDITION, concurs: \"I think there is such a point as 'too much realism,' but it is a long ways down the line. Customers tend to look for a product that mimics reality. I think you take it too far when you simulate all the bad, but realistic, elements of a game. In golf, it would be a mistake to make you qo find your ball.\" Again, however, the problem is that what one sports fan thinks is important may not be what another fan thinks-and this is what leads to the smashed keyboards, bad reviews, and harsh Usenet posts. It's especially true of the more hard-core sports games. As Dave Matson, director of Papyrus' NASCAR RACING 1999 EDITION puts it: \"For our fan base, realism is gameplay to a very large extent. Any time the gameplay on the NASCAR RACING \"Localized track conditions and grip levels down do the centimeter (or finer) that are constantly changing due to rubber buildup and weather changes, and a full field of 43 cars running a dynamic Al based on the same complex physics model as the player.\" [Dave Matson, Product Director) GLUG GLUG Converting TROPHY BASS to a 3D engine has proved to be a tough task for Sierra Sports' fishing group. unrealistically high and the physics models are all accelerated.\" Most sports game producers tend to agree with Aubanel that there can actually be such a thing as \"too much realism.\" As Steve Letsom, director of Sierra Sports' fishing games put it, \"Imagine yourself sitting at the computer for hours on end, not being able to catch a fish. That is like the real world, and it sucks! I try to make the user have fun, but be challenging at the same time. It's definitely a hard line to straddle.\" Straddling that line is where most designers expend the bulk of their conceptual energy-trying to figure out where to implement a sport's rules to the letter, and MADDEN NFL \"How about polygonal collision modeling (eliminate motion capture) so every tackle and hit is different, or maybe a 3Dglasses version, so when you look left and right you see what a player would see. Or maybe an impact suit, so when you get hit hard, you feel it! [Ric Neil, Producer] reverse jam through 4 defenders. Orel Hershiser launching a grand slam off Greg Maddux. Anyone who's ever played any sports game has experienced a moment, if not a million moments, of total disbelief. As you read this, there's a sports gamer out there right now pounding on his keyboard, screaming, \"Yeah, right!\" The most crucial design decision in any sports game is just how realistic to make the game. The big rub—the one that often trips up developers-is that the more real istic you say your game is and the more real-life rules you say you're going to incorporate, the harder the fans are gonna treat your game if it doesn't feel realistic (remember Accolade's disastrous LEGENDS FOOTBALL?). If you opt for greater fantasy, as did NFL BLITZ or an arcade racer like NEED FOR SPEED, gamers will cut you much more slack, but you risk turning off the more \"serious\" fans of the sport. Somewhere between a hardcore simulation and a pure arcade game is where most sports developers try to place their products these days. But finding that balance is a very tricky business. \"This is the hardest part of the job,\" said FIFA's Aubanel. \"We are constantly weighing gameplay considerations against realism. We have always biased FIFA playability over realism. In fact, if you look at most sports games, the scores are FIFA \"In a perfect world our gameplay logic would have 22 individual players 'thinking strategically, and we would have generated motion. This way we could control all aspects of the movement of a player in a seamless animated environment.\" (Marc Aubanel, Producer) TROPHY BASS \"Ideally, TROPHY BASS would have the lake exactly so that when you went to the real lake, you'd recognize it. We'd also like it to have force-feedback fishing poles for every player.\" Steve Letsom, Producer) SIMON SAYS PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN You might not actually stand this way while playing golf, but game designers need to study every aspect of their characters' physical structure and movement, as this shot from Activision's JACK NICKLAUS: GOLDEN BEAR CHALLENGE shows. 20 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"SPORTS  BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME CUT NO CORNERS Sports game designers are constantly trying to find the right balance between realism and gameplay. The folks at Papyrus Design Group lean heavily on the side of realism in games like GRAND PRIX LEGENDS, shown here. Perfecting the Product \"Par is whatever | say it is. I've got one hole that's a par 23 and yesterday 1 damn near birdied the sucker.\" -Willie Nelson screen seems different than what they see on TV, users complain,\" The answer, then, is to match the game's scope to the targeted demographic. Go ahead and let the cars bounce off the walls in NEED FOR SPEED, but cut corners on NASCAR and prepare for an avalanche of flames. Matson again: \"By and large, the difficulty and depth of the game is what gives it tremendous legs. You'd be amazed at how many NASCAR sim fanatics will only race at full 100 percent distances, which can be over four hours long, without a break. But, hey, that's what the real guys do every week.\" And for many sports gamers, being the \"real guy\" is the only acceptable way to play-regardless of the sport. because the technology issues are still very fragile and very new to the fishing group. When we tweak the engines, sometimes we break things, and then we have to find out what happened. It's a much slower process.\" Licensing can be another thing that bogs down the process. Gamers are increasingly dissatisfied with a sports game that does not include real player names, real team logos, real schedules, and so on. This licensing costs a lot of money, and it also means that you have to play by the licensee's rules. Sports developers thus don't just have their bosses and the fans breathing down their necks; they have a large governing body, like the NFL or Major League Baseball, hovering over their work and making sure that they're getting everything right. \"The NFL approves every version of the game as we finish them,\" said Ric Neil. \"They could deny us approval if they want to.\" Licensees vary in their degree of involvement, according to Mike Branham at Sierra. \"Some want to be there from start to finish, with approval and veto all along the way. Others care only that the licensed logo information is correctly displayed. The rest are somewhere in between.\" Multiplayer considerations, once an afterthought, are now part of the process from Day 1 with every have approached the development of the game with a more sophisticated philosophy. We are getting much better at reusing code that should be reused. We leverage off a lot of common code that works on all three platforms (PC, N64, and PlayStation). This allows the more than 70 people on FIFA to focus and really become specialists in their areas of responsibility.\" When a product makes a big technological leaplike the big switch from 2D to 3D that most sports games have gone through the past couple years—the process can bog down, as Sierra Sports' fishing group is discovering this year. \"TROPHY BASS 3D and TROPHY MARLIN are longer projects,\" said Steve Letsom, \"because they are 3D and Once the developers have their feature set down and have decided on the proper focus, they have to make the game, again with a host of constraints conspiring against them, especially the deadline. This is where good, existing products have the advantage. Marc Aubanel says the process of producing FIFA is much more stream lined now, with a few seasons under the design team's belt. \"We O ANATOMY OF A QUARTERBACK Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre goes through quite a transformation as the artists on Sierra's FOOTBALL PRO 99 piece him together. www.computer gaming COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME SPORTS issues. Each game has been improved, but we've got a long way to go.\" Getting It Out the Door \"If you aren't fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with enthusiasm.\" ---Vince Lombardi lives are at stakes0 we are allowed a certain amount of freedom. On FIFA, we never feel that we have shipped with bugs that were serious and would impede anyone's enjoyment of the game.\" Nevertheless, designers hate, just as you do, when their games ship with bugs, and everyone concerned agreed that serious bugs must be addressed with a patch on the Internet now. Any bugs deemed less important can always be fixed in next year's version a process that, as you know, begins as soon as the previous version goes out the door. YOUR WIRES ARE SHOWING If you don't get all the details right, the sports fanatic will know. Even the stadiums themselves must be accurately rendered. Here's a work-in-progress shot from Sierra's FOOTBALL PRO 99. End Game \"It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I just beat Muhammad Ali person we talked with—because they have to be. Those who decide to add it later usually pay a price. \"In products I've been involved with in the past, multiplayer has sometimes been added in after the product is pretty much done,\" said Mike Branham. \"We all learn from our mistakes. The multiplayer option is now something that is designed in from the very start.\" Vance Cook agrees. \"We learned the hard way that a game must be designed and developed with multiplayer in mind,\" Cook said. \"FPS: GOLF added multiplayer capabilities much later in the development process. It was more work and less stable than PGA CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF.\" The end result of working with multiplayer issues from the beginning, according to Cook, is that the development is easier, the product is better, and it is more stable.\" Still, it's hard not to get the feel ing that, given everything else they have to deal with, some developers wish that multiplayer would just go away. \"Multiplayer games over the Internet are dicey at best,\" said Steve Letsom. \"This has been the largest problem for me over the last few years. You have to design a very fault-tolerant game, and be able to recover from all sorts of areps \"We You read all the previews. You waited and waited. You plunked down your money. You took the game home-and within five min utes you found two horrendous bugs. What's up with this? Did they even look at the game before they shipped it? The answer, of course, is yesbut as with everything else in sports game development, the process is fast and frenetic, and not 100 percent guaranteed. Different companies start testing their games at different times, but everyone we talked to agreed that QA (quality assurance) was critical to their game's ultimate success. On FIFA, Aubanel said \"we have a test group of more than 30 testers. We test it from Day 1 when we start the design process. QA takes a critical role throughout development. We take beta testers' comments very seriously.\" TROPHY BASS had \"around 100 beta testers,\" according to Steve Letsom, to make sure the game works properly, but \"the real reason I like it is to verify it runs on many different configurations.\" It all sounds great, but the harsh reality is, it's an imperfect process. \"As we get close to final,\" said Ric Neil, \"a fix might break something that has been fine for a long time, and since we are short on time it is hard to test every facet of the game.\" Marc Aubanel, the producer of FIFA, has a more brutally fatalistic response: \"The demands put on the development community to make games that do things on the platform that were never thought possible cause a lot of engineering difficulties. Since this is not the control mechanism of a plane, no Endurance, strength, conviction, and a will to succeed against impossible odds. These are the qualities found in the best athletes, and they're also the ones that distinguish the best sports game designers. Every force is conspired against them: their employers, their budgets, their deadlines, their fans' high expectations. This is not to say that you should feel guilty. This is not to say that you have no right to complain if that football game you just bought is an unplayable piece of crud. Go ahead and complain. Go ahead and complain even if the game is great. That's what being a sports fan is all about. We all have our opinions, and we all think we're right. Those spending their professional lives showing us their versions of the sports we love, well—they might just be the biggest, loudest, craziest fans of them all. \"For our fan base, realism is gameplay to a very large extent. » Jeff Green, pathetically, is a Golden State Warriors fan.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME STRATEGY/WAR STRATEGIC MANEUVERS t the recent Milia Conference in France, game design legends Peter Molyneaux and Sid Meier-in between bouts of sampling French wine and cuisine for research purposes-each spoke at one of those you-had-tobe somebody-to-get-standingroom-only-tickets keynotes. Molyneaux began the festivities by going on at length about the trials and tribulations of crafting a piece of interactive entertainment, complete with lots of suffering for your art and giving up years of your life. When it was Meier's turn to speak, he looked up and down the row of dignitaries and Making a Strategy/War Game That Isn't a CivClone & Conquer [by Terry Coleman) always the same: Is it turn-based or real-time? This black-and-white view totally ignores the fact that there are multiple shades of each. for instance, FANTASY GENERAL HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC II, innovation (MYTH and TOTAL ANNIHILATION's use of 3D terrain). According to Greg Borrud, director of Pandemic Studios and designer of DARK REIGN II, the difference is all in how you design a game: \"Our goals are always to make a game that you can pick up and play, and DARK REIGN II will be relatively simple to understand. As you play a game more and more, we want to you uncover the layers of complexity that present themselves as you become a better player.\" Rick Martinez, who has designed turn-based strategy/war games-PANZER GENERAL II, among others-and real-time combat simulations (PANZER COMMANDER), thinks the whole turn-based versus real-time game debate is blown out of proportion. \"There are situations in which realtime works well-for instance, if you're trying to simulate WWII squad-level combat-but you could make an argument that games such as X-COM or CHAOS GATE do just as good a job. What's important is that your design approach has the proper feel \"I love the turnbased tabletop and WARLORDS III are all, in a technical sense, turn-based fantasy strategy games (and each was rated five stars by CGW). Yet these three games play quite differently from each other, they require you to master a variety of tactics to succeed, and they offer much more replayability than most of the real time strategy clones released in the past 18 months. On the flip side, the best of the real-time strategy games have pushed the envelope further in terms of multiplay (the online and network gaming explosion generated by COMMAND & CONQUER and WARCRAFT) and technical  HARPDON HARBOBX is a much better real-time game on the computer than it ever could have been as turn-based (Carl Norman, currently producing HARPOON 4] remarked, \"I don't know what business Peter's in, but I'm perfectly happy to be designing games for a living. It's a pretty good life, and after you reach a certain point they feed you pretty well.\" The irony, of course, is that both men are right. When you consider the number of strategy/war games released each year-more in 1998 than the total number of games, of all genres, released in 1993—you have to go the extra mile, or parsec, or real-time micrometer, to have a chance at a hit. And gaming legends are not excepted. \" I'm perfectly happy to be designing games for a living. It's a pretty good life.'

It was really interesting for a little while. Then you'd get stuck in one city, and by the time you got back to the strategic level, you had no idea where you were in the overall L game. Once I made the Civ design turn-based, I was able to keep the level of detail and the depth of decision-making to where it was challenging, but still manageable enough to be fun.\" In trying to solve the problem of designing real-time or turn-based games, SSG's lan Trout (CARRIERS AT WAR, WARLORDS III, REACH FOR THE STARS, and others) offers a solution—at least, one that seems to work for a small developer: \"We don't like having all our eggs in one basket. And so, now that we're no longer self-publishing, we tend to develop games for a number of publishers-all of which have different criteria for judging a game. As a result, even though we do mainly strategy/war games, we have enough variety in the styles of games we design to keep our publishers happy-and us interested. And if we're interested, our customers will be. GETTYSBURG is Sid Meier's idea of what a real-time strategy game should be complete with great multiplay and excellent tutorials. design techniques used in the past. The most common way of getting that knowledge is studying and playing a lot of games.\" While it's obvious from the number of strategy/war clones that migrate quickly to the bargain bins each year that a lot of \"borrowing\" goes on, it's even more apparent that too many designers never get past reinventing the wheel. You wonder, in fact, if they ever leave their coding cube. Almost every successful strate gy game designer I interviewed kept referring to focus: the importance of having a solid game design concept before the first line of code is written. Watching Steve Barcia work with his team at Simtex, for example, was like revisiting boardgame design sessions at Avalon Hill or SPI in years past. Engineers hashed out algorithms on paper, jotting down formulae on chalkboards, arguing over which would work better with character design or firepower modifiers or whatnot-while Barcia acted as master of ceremonies for the creative circus. \"For me, as a gamer, it has to be challenging and addictive,\" Barcia says. \"But as a programmer, I can also step in and come up with an algorithm to model whatever idea we discuss. You have to avoid the temptation to get so complicated that the user doesn't know what's going on. The gamer has to feel he's in control of the situation.\" Or, as Dunnigan used to say in his game-design seminars, \"The game must have the illusion of movement-of something happening-even if the overall situation remains relatively at equilibrium.\" Game designers increasingly try to give more bang for the buck with more scenarios, bigger and better units, more editing tools, and optional rules out the wazoo. Who can forget Brian Reynolds' abovethe-call-of-duty support of Civ II, crafting one new version of the game after another, even after he left MicroProse for Firaxis? And I can't help mentioning one of my favorites, TOTAL ANNIHILATION, which brought the concept of free downloadable add-on units and maps almost to an art form. Still, more is not always better. PEOPLE'S GENERAL, for example, has «What's important is that your design approach has the cproper feel Everything's Under Control In his classic work, The Complete Wargames Handbook, Jim Dunnigan—designer of more than 100 board and computer games-offers some sage advice: \"The key to designing a game is thorough knowledge of all the and that you don't get distracted from that focus.\" [Rick Martinez.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME  STRATEGY/WAR GBAR production, we showed our first public demo at a press day that Activision held in Los Angeles. The game was received incredibly well, and we were able to get a few months' extension to make sure we could get all the cool things into the game that we had designed in these first few weeks. As the game got more recognition, we could ask for more extensions. In the end, the game took a year to make, but most of the final design elements were hatched in those first few frantic weeks of development.\" While Wargames in particular have a small crowd of fans who crave realism above all else, most gamers I know are more interested in historical feel. It's not terribly important whether the Iron Brigade had 997 men or 1,007, so long as the unit plays like the Iron URES and you might expect to hear rhapsodizing about technical brilliance, but everyone I talked with focused on gameplay and on making the game a fun and, it's hoped, replayable experience. One designer who preferred to remain anonymous said, \"Nothing annoys me more than a game engine masquerading as a game. There's nothing wrong with being an engineer and developing a cool technical concept, but you have to be a gamer, too-or else nobody's going to care about your game when the next cool technotoy comes out.\" Sid Meier, the king of playability, is almost as notorious as id Software for saying, \"The game will be done when it's done.\" The really bizarre thing is that Meier also claims to be able to have a working prototype in just a few weeks. Then he tweaks for more than a year. Go figure. Other games come about in a far different way. \"DARK REIGN had one of the most bizarre development cycles of any project I have been on,\" says Greg Borrud. \"When we first started working on the game, our mandate was to create a fun game and have it out by Christmas. Josh and I quickly assembled a team of designers and we set down to create an RTS game. Because time was not on our side, we worked around the clock and designed the entire game-including all the features, units, story, and missions—in about two weeks. We also started work on cut-scene movies and game music. By the end of that period we took a step back and started to get real excited about the potential of the game. After about five weeks of L9RRIER Even though DARK REIGN was long in the making, you can see here that the art team had a good idea of where it was going in terms of unit design. STIKE a superior game system wrapped around mostly mediocre scenarios, a handicap that all the editing functions in the world can't overcome. Sometimes, according to Carl Norman, putting the power in the gamer's hands can spring from less-than-altruistic motives: \"After listening to gamers complain about different options they'd like to have seen in this game or that, we finally decided in STEEL PANTHERS II to let 'em toggle every damn thing.

"STRATEGY/WAR  BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME \"Modem play should be included because the audience expects it. But that doesn't mean you can neglect the Al.\" (Mark Baldwin EMPIRE DELUXE] NAPOLEON designer David Landrey. \"The research must be solid, of course. Never forget, though, that the game must be playable above all else. What good does it do to have a game that is praised for its realism but collects dust on the shelf? Awards are great, but I listen more to my customers. From a technical standpoint, I've always focused on the operational-level game, because it shows you things you don't get from the purely tactical or strategic viewpoints.\" The value of knowing your audience is just as relevant for fun, fast-paced real-time strategy games from Blizzard and Westwood as it is for realistic turnbased wargames from TalonSoft and HPS Simulations. A lot of the success of these companies comes from the fact that they not only finish cooking their games before they ship them, they also have incredible follow-up. TalonSoft routinely retrofits enhancements onto earlier games in its BATTLEGROUND series, a practice that other companies would do well to emulate. \"I feel sorry for anyone who can't. after a little practice, beat 640K of memory in a strategy game.\" [Mark Herman Great Battles) our \"Take Command\" feature for more on CIV II MULTIPLAYER GOLD.) Meier concurs: \"I'd always thought that multiplayer was more hype than anything else...until i played WARCRAFT II with my son (he always enjoys beating Dad) and it occurred to me that you could balance a real-time Civil War game between novices and veterans much the same way.\" When Meier started working on GETTYSBURG, therefore, he integrated multiplay into the design from the ground up, complete with randomly generated scenarios to give gamers who wouldn't know Little Round Top from Rocky Top a fighting chance against armchair Civil War historians. And it's hardly a coincidence that Reynolds and Meier's next game, SID MEIER'S ALPHA CENTAURI, will also include multiplay-even though it's a classic turn-based design. Then there are the games that try to be everything to all gamers. Interplay's Ali Atabek reminisced recently about MAX and MAX 2, but his comments apply to a number of strategy games: \"We tried to bridge the gap between turn-based and real-time in MAX, and I thought it worked pretty well. But for multiplayer, things have to move quickly, and if you aren't careful you design a game that doesn't satisfy either the solitary gamer or the multiplayer fanatic.\" Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened with MAX 2. Flat Cat, Atabek's development group at Interplay, has apparently learned some lessons, switching to a more cerebral real-time approach for its next strategy game, STAR FLEET COMMAND (see the \"Take Command\" feature in this issue), which seems to work quite well for both solo and multiplay. In any case, Atabek was designing realtime strategy games such as SIEGE long before they were popular, so we're not terribly worried. Is multiplay here to stay? U ndoubtedly it is, but a recent careful It may have been a while since he had a hit, but Crawford could pack more Al in 4K than most current programmers can with hundreds more K of memory at their disposal. All for One and One for All The more check marks there are on the back of the box, the more comfortable marketing folks feel which generally means that they want real-time designs, because that implies multiplayer. Brian Reynolds was very aware of this when working on SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION Il two years ago, and so he put multiplayer hooks in the code. \"At the time,\" Reynolds says, \"we really wanted to focus on the single-player design, since that's how everyone thought of Civ. But I have to admit it was a lot of fun testing the multiplayer against Sid in his own game. To this day, I wish we'd had the time to get (multiplay) in and working for CIV II before we both left MicroProse.\" (After more than two years, we'll soon find out if multiplay in CIVILIZATION Il is still relevant.

Deus ex Machina We could fill a book with discussions about Al, but we won't. Still, it's hard to talk about strategy/war design without asking, \"What exactly is AI?\" First and foremost, it's the computer opponent, which may or may not obviously cheat. Secondly, it's the code that directs the \"wingman\" routines for those units you don't directly micromanage every second of the game. Finally, Al also covers such mun dane routines as pathfinding-like for those ships in AGE OF EMPIRES that can't figure out how to sail out of port to the good fishing spots and back. Jim Dunnigan states it flatly: \"AI routines are not quite as complicated as they might appear, and they need not take up a lot of space in the program.\" While some programmers can write tight Al code, methinks that too many designers are taking Dunnigan's words much more to heart than they should. Graphics are nice, but after a while, you get tired of seeing your Orcs slam into trees time and again. A few programmers were mentioned by their peers for writing elegant algorithms and having strong computer opponents, such as Sid Meier (for the Al in CIVILIZATION) and Steve Barcia (for the diplomatic routines in the original MASTER OF ORION). Most programmers, however, are not that impressed by the majority of the Al work they see. \"There is nothing more obvious and frustrating\" says Greg Borrud, \"than bad Al in an RTS game. having to constantly micromanage can't tell you how many times we their every action?

This is an example of a \"good cheat,\" because it not only added fun to the game, it was also as close as you could get in EASTERN FRONT to re-creating the \"pockets\" historically caused by the rapid advance of the Wehrmacht. The lesson for game designers, then, is to worry less about fuzzy logic, neural networking, or other trendy programming, and to show more imagination and passion. The best strategy games—whether turn-based fantasy, cerebral realtime historical, or hybrid grand strategic sci-fi-are made by these famed designers for one main reason: In every case, it was a game that they wanted to play.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME ADVENTURE/ROLE-PLAYING UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER The World and They That Dwell Therein My preconception in looking at role-playing design was that designers would begin with the universe. Yet, quickly discovered that technological concerns and psychological concerns outweighed the creation of the game world. Zeb Cook, formerly an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons designer at TSR and now working on a secret project at Interplay, says that he'll work in any universe that sounds interesting to him. \"If it isn't interesting to you, why would you want to design a game around it?\" Since Cook was the demented mind behind TSR's Planescape environment for AD&D Creating Worlds for Adventure/Role-Playing Games [by Johnny L. Wilson] oth adventure games and roleplaying games are essentially \"gated\" stories. They are like the old days at Disneyland when you needed separate tickets to ride various attractions. If you only wanted to ride the horse-drawn trolley on Main Street, you needed an \"A\" ticket (originally valued at approximately 10 cents). If you wanted to ride the Matterhorn, you needed an \"E\" ticket (originally valued at approximately 75 cents). Without the ticket, you missed the attraction or had to buy supplementary tickets at the face value. In adventure games and role-playing games, you need \"tickets\" to move the story forward to get through the \"gates\" the designers put up. In both types of games, the tickets to more of the story can be either crucial objects in your inventory (keys, clues, and \"McGuffins\"—the powerful or desirable objects obtained by the protagonist in successful quests) or \"must-do\" activities completed (puzzles solved, rooms explored, characters met, and conversations held). In role-playing, you can add successful combat and character development to the tickets you'll need in order for your characters to get through the designer's turnstile and into more of the story. The design issues in adventure and role-playing games are basically the same. The problem of world creation, character creation and development, story development, and the tickets that gate the story are largely the same. Role-playing games simply use more tickets by having combat and character development to rely upon. So, we talked to four prominent role-playing designers, believing that their insights to RPG design would apply to both adventure and roleplaying games. * Technology is first=. what the game can do.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME  ADVENTURE/ROLE-PLAYING Lord British, keep striving to create richer, deeper worlds. Other designers develop the world merely as a stage setting. All want to immerse the gamer in the game. Know Thyself To immerse the garner in a world, however, requires a populated world. To create the characters for the world requires two systems—one to design the player character(s) and one to design the nonplayer characters. Naturally, the philosophies run the gamut from detail to outline in this part of the process, as well. In the world of MIGHT & MAGIC, the possibilities for attributes, skills, talents, races, and social status are all based on what they can do in the game engine. Jon van Caneghem believes that none of factors is going to make a difference to the gamer unless it can be depicted onscreen. He does express one cardinal rule, though. \"The (character) name has to be pronounceable. I have a mental block that if I can't pronounce it, I lose track of who the character is and where he/she fits.\" In general, the M&M teams build a map-based flowchart which shows how the characters relate to each other on the basis of their start and motiva tion. They connect them all on a big whiteboard in the conference room or JVC's office. Later, they write it down and transfer the details to spreadsheets or Word documents. Then, they erase it and go on to the next detail level. Brian Fargo agrees with van Caneghem. \"I like to think about the situations I want to put the character in, and then back up from there. There are a lot of products that have all of these skills and attributes that have such a minimal effect on the universe that they might as well not be there. To me, the attributes and skill sets are the means to the end, my tool for getting there. I'd rather have an RPG with four attributes used incredibly cleverly than 50 attributes not used very much at all.\" Lord British believes that it is necessary to do background character studies of each principal character in the game. Today, he brings in professional writers to flesh out the characters and dialogue. Raymond Benson (author of the James Bond novel Zero Minus Ten) did this in ULTIMA VII, and Kim Krizan, coauthor of the screenplay to Before Sunrise (the Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy film), is doing this for ULTIMA: ASCENSION. Lord British laughs as he recalls Krizan's first observation about the VP OF GNOMES? Interplay's BALDUR'S GATE uses character studies like this portrait and description of Quayle to flesh out game designs. For example, \"When asked about his past, Quayle talks for a good hour about his worship of Baravar Cloakshadow, how he is well on his way to mastering sorcery, and just generally how incredibly smart he is compared to everyone else in the party.\" CSOLADO URO ILULLOREERDERADE aldetzeletano character of Raven, a female character who assists the avatar in the new game. \"She said it was like adolescent boys writing about a female character.\" \"I didn't have to do this in the early days of ULTIMA because I was lucky enough to know people in the Society for Creative Anachronism who were the characters I wanted to write about. I already knew Dupre and was able to write about the aspects of the real person. My knowledge of the person served me as the backdrop. After a few years, I began to see the results of creating them by choice instead of accident.\" Zeb Cook sees the character design and the market as part of a continuum. \"The world and the market determine the character design. If it's going to hardcore role-players, I'm gonna use numbers. If you want broad-based appeal, you have to figure a way to reduce the numbers as much as possible.\" Like the others, Cook sees the system as being determined by style of play. \"All systems are built in order to create the style of play I want. If it's going to have a rich story and background, you want to spend ULTIMATE UNDEAD An artist adds ghoulish textures to the 3D wire-frame of a zombie for ULTIMA: ASCENSION.

"ADVENTURE/ROLE-PLAYING  BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME the field is there for richness. All we would do today is have that farmer wave to you and make the world come to life.\" Lord British points out that this approach allows designers to concentrate on enriching the principal characters of the story and placing the emphasis on their character development. SPRY & SPLASHY MIGHT & MAGIC VII will feature hundreds of NPCs, who will look something like this. more time in character creation and letting gamers fiddle around with lots of attributes, skills, etc.\" Characters have to develop. The simple answer as to what levels, skills, knowledge increments, and promotions to give the character is: Whatever works. Fargo observes, \"NEUROMANCER could only work with knowledge additions. Password-oriented stuff and obtaining new software was much more interesting than level development or attribute increases.\" Zeb Cook agrees, but points out that it is better to let the gamer make up his/her own mind as to where the character improves. \"The preferred method of character development is to go out and get some general experience and spend it as you will, as opposed to go out to do stuff and blink, you go up a level.\" A cardinal rule for Cook is to make sure the balance is such that evervone can't be good at every thing. \"Everyone will end up being like Conan. I did the Conan role playing game for TSR. It wasn't fun. It had an interesting character development system, but nobody wanted to play the sidekicks.\" possible Unfashionable Is What Other People Wear Another problem for both adventure and role-playing designers is how detailed to program the nonplayer characters. Lord British indicates that his philosophy on this has changed. In the earlier days, we tried to mechanically simulate every possible reaction-getting exponentially harder and harder with less success. The more we tried, the more mechanical they seemed. Also, we were doing work that wouldn't be appreciated. Now, we only try to simulate what is appropriate to a character. For example, a farmer by Lord British does hint, however, at the future of NPC interaction. He talks about intelligent databases In the and successful tests with this earlier days technology in order to suggest a strategy for having rich, intelligent w e tried to NPC conversations in the future. He m echanically doesn't know when this might enter simulate.every into the world of ULTIMA, but he does have his dream. Van Caneghem agrees that you reaction getting shouldn't try to make the NPC sysexponentially tems too detailed. \"Since comput harder and ers don't do personalities and atti harder with tudes that well, it doesn't make less sense to expect them to do what success. they're not good with.\" Hence, you see more reaction than evolution in the NPC characters in M&M. [Lord British, designer of the ULTIMA series and founder of Origin Systems Van Caneghem even tries to keep the game's dialogue simple. \"M&M ASCENSION ROLL-CALL At Origin, artists like to put character has the one-key spew.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME LEGAL ISSUES PROTECTING YOUR kay, you've read the stuff on game design, you've got a killer idea, and you're confident you can be the next John Romero. You're sure that if you pitch your idea to the right publisher, they'll cough up an advance to develop it. But how can you keep your brainchild from getting stolen? ONLINE See an expanded version of this article on www.computergaming.com What You Should Know About Intellectual Property Rights [ by Michael Hawash) My idea There are three other aspects of intellectual property law that game developers should know about:copyright law, trademark law, and patents. Once a game is in development, everything that is created can be copyright protected. Basically, copyright protection arises automatically once an \"original effort has been started and some aspect of it has been fixed in a tangible medium.\" This means that not only is the finished product protected by copyright, but also the various components of the game including the code, graphics, movies, sounds, icons, documentation, and even the box art. Game developers should keep in mind that copyright protection extends only to the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. While copyright covers existing works, trademark seeks to secure a developers' rights in future works by protecting product, line, or company name recognition. Basically, trademarks allow game developers to identify their games with names, logos, or \"service marks\" and prevent their competitors from distributing games that have confusingly similar characteristics. Patents also protect intellectual property, but it is unlikely that patent issues will arise in the context of basic game development To obtain a patent, you must be the original inventor of a \"new and useful process, machine, or improvement.\" I can't stress enough that this information is no substitute for a lawyer's advice and protection. Even if you are going it alone on a shoestring, you must retain a lawyer who is experienced in software contracts and intellectual property rights. On its Web site, the Gathering of Developers (GOD) has posted its Ten Developer Commandments of inside information that all game developers need to know. Commandment Ten is \"Get a good attorney.\" a is sacred. My idea is sacredi. The first thing you need to understand is the concept of a trade secret. Laws vary by state, but all states have two basic requirements for trade secret protection. First, the information must be something that gives the holder a business advantage in the marketplace. Second, reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that the information remains confidential. Typical trade secrets involve not only the specific game idea, but also the means, methods, and techniques the developer will use to make the game a commercially viable venture. Trade secrets arise automatically if the above two requirements are met. The trick is not to waive trade secret protection. One simple way for game developers to make sure they maintain trade secret protection is to use confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. Developers should make sure that anyone to whom trade secrets are disclosed has signed such an agreement. By using confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, developers avail themselves of a host of legal remedies if an employee, independent contractor, investor, or some other signatory to the agreement misappropriates proprietary information. You can find examples—both good and bad-of confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements on the Web; simply search for \"nondisclosure agreement\" or \"confidentiality agreement.\" Many bookstores also carry books with examples of simple confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. One word of caution: Before you use any agreement obtained from a Web site or book, make sure that a lawyer reviews it. If it turns out the agreement is poorly worded or is otherwise unenforceable, it could end up costing you thousands of dollars in the w long run. Some publishers may refuse to sign confiden6 tiality and nondisclosure agreements. In fact, the typical submission agreement is the 5 complete opposite of a confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement. Unfortunately for My idea is Michael Hawash is an attorney with the Houston, Texas, law firm of Meyer, Orlando & Evans. Write him at mhawash@meyerorlando.com. developers, publishers look at so many gaming ideas that if they signed confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, they would expose themselves to numerous lawsuits if they reject ed one submission and published another based on a similar idea. This is a harsh reality for budding developers, but it must be accepted if you want to try to get a publishing contract. Perhaps the best way to protect yourself from publishers is to make sure your game is far enough along that you can complete it before they can. If your demo shows gameplay features, the publisher will think more about buying the game than stealing your ideas. But be wary of showing your coolest graphics or features until a publisher commits. And limit the number of people you show it to-be selective about approaching publishers.

"BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME  LEGAL ISSUES GROW YOUR ave you ever talked with your gaming buddies about starting your own studio? Well, you're not alone. Many develop ment companies have been created informally by a few guys in their den or college dorm room. When a company is formed in this you are creating a general partnership, it can just happen! This is because under the law of most states, whenever two or more people band together for a business venture, it is presumed that a general partnership has been created unless the partners go through the formalities of creating another type of entity. The practical significance of this is very serious. Whereas you and your partner(s) get to split all profits, you are also personally liable for all of the financial obligations of the partnership. This means that if your venture is unsuccessful, anyone to whom the partnership owes money can hold you personally liable for not just your share of the debt, but the entire partnership obligation. ONLINE for advice on getting your first publish ing contract, see the author's expanded article at www.gamespot.com. Legal Issues in Forming Your Own Development Company [by Michael Hawash) partnership, or corporation. Each entity has its own advantages and disadvantages. The main difference between all of these entities is the amount of personal liability you will have, as an owner of the company, if something goes wrong. generally cannot give them any equity in the company. Since most gaming ventures are started by more than one person, successful sole proprietorships are something of a rarity in the gaming business. manner, a general partnership has usually been created. More often than not, no consideration is given to basic partnership issues like who owns company assets (including intellectual property), what will happen if a founder leaves, how much say each founder has in partnership decisions, or how the company is going to go about designing games. This is a mistake. If some of these basic questions are not answered when the company is founded, a serious disagreement could destroy the company before its first game ships. I haven't started my own game company, but as an attorney I've helped plenty of clients form new companies. I've also represented clients who wish they'd been more careful when they founded a company without knowing all the issues. In this article I'll outline the four basic entities you might consider if you decide to grow your own studio, and some of the issues you'll need to think about if you take the plunge. I'll also describe the roles of developers and publishers, and explain the difference between self-publishing and signing a deal with a publisher. This article is by no means comprehensive, but will give you the basics of how to start making your own games. General Partnership The second most basic business entity is a general partnership. A general partnership is basically a sole proprietorship with more than one proprietor. It is very easy to form a general partnership. In fact, you do not have to file any documents or even formally state that Limited Partnership limited partnership is a type of partnership that, as the name suggests, limits the liability of the limited partners. Limited partnerships are designed to allow individuals to invest in partnerships. The liability of a limited partner is restricted to each partner's interest in the partnership (i.e. a limited partner cannot be held personally liable for all of the partnership's debts). However, there must always Sole Proprietorship The simplest entity is a sole proprietorship. Under a sole proprietorship, a single individual operates the company under his or her name or a fictitious name. If you operate the company under your own name, no state filings are required. If you operate the company under a fictitious name, you will need to file a d/b/a (Doing Business As) disclosure in your state of residence. Once this is done, you are officially in business. By forming a sole proprietorship, you can deduct your business expenses from your annual taxes. The main disadvantage of a sole proprietorship is that you are personally liable for all your business' financial obligations, including loans, leases, other contracts, and tort liability (i.e. liability for intentional or negligent acts or omissions that cause harm to another individual or entity). The second main disadvantage to a sole proprietorship is that it is difficult to get investors to put money in your business because you I'd like to start my own game company. but how do I do it?!?!

"LEGAL ISSUES BUILDING THE PERFECT GAME let's see. do 1 trust those bastards enough to form a partnership? formal documents and filings reviewed by your accountant or lawyer. Keep in mind that once a corporation is formed, it must behave like a corporation. This means that certain corporate formalities must be followed, including: corporate record keeping, no commingling of corporate and personal funds, annual meetings for shareholders and directors, and the observation of shareholder voting rights. It you fail to follow any of these formalities, cred itors and others may be able to \"pierce the corporate veil\" and reach the personal assets of the shareholders to discharge alleged corporate liabilities. There are other types of business entities. However, these four are the basic ones from which all others derive. A lawyer or account ant can tell you about other types of business entities that are available in your state. be at least one general partner who is responsible for the entire venture. If a limited partner behaves like a general partner and plays an active role in the business, such involvement can trigger full general partnership liability. There fore, whereas a limited partnership may be a means of getting your Uncle Bob to help you get started by giving him an equity stake, it is not a vehicle to limit liability for those partners who are going to play an active role in the business. because this type of corporation pays no tax at the corporate level Instead, each shareholder reports any profit (or loss) on his individual tax return. The disadvantage of S Corps is that they are limited to 75 shareholders. However, this restriction usually does not pose a problem to a start-up game development company that only has a few founders. Although the requirements for forming a corporation vary from state to state, the process is not as complicated as you might think. Basically, all that you have to do is file articles of incorpora tion with the Secretary of State in the state you want to incorporate. Depending on the state, you may have to pay a corporate tax to stay in business. There are many books and online resources that can assist you in forming a corporation. However, should you decide to go the corporate route, make sure that you have all them. More often than not, these initial roles will change over time. Therefore, create a mechanism by which the roles of founders can be assessed and modified on a periodic basis. Make sure that all intellectual property rights are owned by the company (see the related article on Protecting Your Idea). This way, no one founder can prevent the project from moving forward if he disagrees with how the company should operate. It is also a good idea to include some provision that will allow the founders to \"buy out\" a founder who becomes disgruntled or leaves. If profits, risks, and responsibilities are going to be shared unevenly by the partners, make sure such arrangements are specifically spelled out in the agreement. Any partnership agreement must be signed by everyone who is going to have an equity interest (ownership) in the new company. Your failure to do so will require all profits to be split evenly between the partners, regardless of who provided seed capital, labor, or partn ership assets. We've covered somebut by no means all of the issues faced by new game development companies. If you do decide to form your own company, make sure that a lawyer reviews all the documents you intend to be legally binding. Similarly, hire an accountant to advise you on proper business record-keeping procedures. A mistake made in the business format ion stage could have devastating results down the road. Have fun and good luck. Corporations The other basic business entity that you may want to consider is a corporation. There are several different types of corporations. The main difference between the various types is how the owners of the corporation (shareholders) are taxed. One specific corporate entity, called an \"S Corporation,\" is particularly attractive to small game-development companies Have an Agreement Okay, you've read the summaries of each business entity, and you think you know which one works best for you. What do you do next? The first rule of company formation is leave nothing to chance. In other words, draw up an agreement that addresses all of the basic issues. It isn't easy to have pointed business discussions with friends, but a few ruffled feathers early on is better than having a misunderstanding kill the company after months of hard work. At a minimum, have a written agreement that defines the roles of the individual founders and what is expected of The first rule of company formation IS leave nothing to chance\" www.talen COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 "

If you are going to sell your games, you need to have a basic understanding of how the gaming industry works. In other words, you must know how games go from an idea to production, publishing, distribution, and into the hands of the consumer. You must also understand how money flows from the consumer back to you, the developer. There are several types of play ers in the industry. First are the game-development companies that actually make games. These should not be confused with software publishers. Generally, start-up game developers do not publish their own games. Most developers try to strike a deal with a publisher. Under the typical publishing agreement, developers concentrate on making games; publishers fund development, see to production, arrange marketing/advertising, and set up channels of distribution.

In this year's off-the-shelf UGM roundup, we've got the Burn, Baby Burn (cost is no issue) and Bang for the Buck (if your wallet can't take a big hit) roundups packed into a single issue so you can do a side-by-side comparison of the two classes of systems. Because memory prices have stayed down and Intel has been aggressively driving down Pentium Il prices, both system classes have the same chipset (440BX) and the same processor type (Pentium II). As a result, the performance gap has narrowed quite a bit between the two types of systems. To make the Bang for the Buck roundup a little more interesting, we lowered the price limbo bar from $2,500 to $2,000, and we still got in a well-equipped Pentium 11/400MHz system with 64MB of memory A really top-flight gaming rig delivers not only solid performance, but stable drivers all around and the ability to hit on all cylinders right out of the box. In past UGM roundups, Falcon Northwest's mighty Mach V has been one of the very few boxes to consistently deliver on all fronts. But this year, several challengers have drawn a bead on Falcon, and are aiming their boxes squarely at gamers. So who's got the goods? Is Falcon still the way to go? Who will be this year's king of the hill? To find out, read on. ottle COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 "


"Full Throttle Aberdeen Inverness D49G MEGAT GAM * * * * * 9 PRIMARY: 246 SECONDARY: 688 ** 111 WORLD A new UGM entrant, Aberdeen is Aa Web-direct system maker whose Inverness D49G system is designed to be the gamer's dream box. Aberdeen has a great looking rig on paper, but in testing, we came across some rough edges, including a nonfunctioning mouse and a faulty graphics driver. But despite these glitches, the Inverness' twin Pure 3D Ils do turn in the fastest 3D GameGauge score for secondary 3D graphics. In setting up the box we encountered several gotchas, including a cluster of patch cables held together with a tie-lock that connects the 2D/3D board, DVD decoder, and Voodoo boards together, it also connects the primary sound card to the DVD decoder. It's not a bad idea to group them together, but they were not labeled nor color-coded. The USB Logitech mouse's driver that ships with the box wasn't installed, so there was no mouse functionality early on. Installing the driver fixed the problem, but it was annoying to initially boot without a mouse. Also curious is Aberdeen's selection of Acer's Future keyboard, an ergonomic split keyboard whose key mapping for cursor movement and insert/delete/pagedown/pageup/home/end keys is one of the eeas CPU..

Inverness' SuperMicro 750a case is somewhat confusing to get into initially, but after popping off the front panel, the case features twin swing-out doors that make all of the box's innards readily accessible. Inverness' AMI BIOS allows for many low-level tweaks and is easily navigated. Good notables include a Viewsonic PT775 17-inch monitor with a Trinitron tube that features a four-port USB hub. Also, the Aztec Vortex 2 audio board's mixer has a 10-band graphic EQ that allows for more delicate tonal adjustments of the sound coming out of the Cambridge Microworks speakers. One oddity we found was Aberdeen's having a DVD-ROM drive and Kenwood's new CD-ROM drive using Zen Research's seven-beam laser technology. This combination would allow for DVD functionality coupled with very fast game installs, but neither device can write to CD-R or CD-RW. Aberdeen's was the only box to arrive with two read-only ROM drives. Inverness' performance is a little mixed. While it turned in the best secondary graphics 3D GameGauge score, it delivered the second slowest primary graphics 3D GameGauge score, owing to the fact that it uses Matrox's adequate, but already dated, Millennium G200. In fact, the initial G200 driver that arrived with the system wouldn't complete either the 3D WinBench 99 or 3D GameGauge tests. A driver update fixed these problems, but even with this new driver, Aberdeen's 2D/3D card choice also hurt it in the Fill Rate Torture Test in which it finished last of the systems that completed the test. This card's 3Dfx performance is plenty fast, but a 2D card swap would improve its system, as would a better array of game controllers. Aberdeen's offering has most of the right ingredients, but its rough edges and odd 2D/3D choice keep it out of the winner's circle. Aberdeen Inverness D49G. $5,699.

The slight bump in speed allows both boxes to be a little more competitive on CPU benchmarks, although it has little effect on 3D GameGauge scores. The Area 51's numbers were very competitive, and its overall performance was impressive. In the Area 51 you'll find a great lineup of parts and a box that performs well. But this performance is marred by glitches ranging from minor (shaky drivers) to inexcusable (EIDE RAID utility crashes).

There COMPUTER have been reports of users being unable to get certain upgrade graphics boards to run in Compaqs, and in some of its boxes, Compaq has put the AGP accelerator down on the motherboard without an AGP slot, allowing for no upgrade at all.

Its latest high-end offering still sports a case with that unique look, which MING WORLD 3,11,13, design blunder is that Compaq's case still uses Torx screws, which require you to use a special screwdriver to remove them. Is Phillipshead really so bad? The news does get better once you get inside the box, though, since Compaq has done away with its dreaded mezzanine bus configuration wherein all expansion cards live on this board. Its removal was annoying at best, and a knucklebuster at worst. The Compaq motherboard's layout is actually pretty clean, with a RIVA TNTbased Diamond Viper 550 adorning the AGP slot, and ESS' Maestro2 PCI audio accelerator down on the motherboard. This time around, Compaq's BIOS allows for a few more tweaks than in past boxes, but it's still pretty rudimentary This Presario's performance is actually pretty impressive, placing in the middle across most ZD Benchmarks, the two exceptions being WinBench 99's CPU benchmarks, in which it was about the slowest unit tested. However, it was near the top of the class running 3D GameGauge, thanks by and large to its RIVA TNT-powered graphics card. Its Maestro2 audio chip can accelerate Aureal's A3D API, and we encountered no compatibility glitches during testing. Compaq certainly deserves the award for most improved gaming box, but this Presario doesn't ship with game controllers, nor does it include a Voodoo board.

In a recent meeting with some of the Dell crew, we told them, \"Don't take this the wrong way. but one of the best things you do for gamers is that you don't get in the way.\" In fact, that's one of most remarkable things about Dell's machines is that they are such clean implementations, that what they may lack in flash, they make up for in solid performance and easy upgradability. The new Dimension R450 is no exception. This box arrived ready to rumble, never hiccuped during testing, and performed well. The R450 features a sculpted case that's easily accessed by removing a single thumb-screw. Once inside, all the important plumbing is easy to get to, and the unit's Phoenix BIOS allows for basic system tweaking. This is a well-designed case, be it ever so plain. Other noteworthy components are STB'S RIVA TNT-based Velocity 4400 graphics board, an internal EIDE lomega Zip drive, and Turtle Beach's PCI Montego II sound card, based on Aureal Semiconductor's Vortex2 chip (which means that A3D support is present and accounted for). Dell uses Altec Lansing's ADA-70 speakers, which are adequate, but not outstanding. In terms of performance, the Dimension was solid across the board. In ZD benchmark testing, the Dell rig fared pretty well. The one notable score is its Business Disk WinMark score, which is unusually high for an EIDE drive. This is a result of Dell's diskcontroller driver, which locks down a large chunk of system memory to use as a disk cache during testing. However, when a game's running, this amount of memory for disk caching wouldn't be available, so actual disk performance will most likely be less than this score would indicate. This isn't cheating per se, but it does skirt the line.

Of all the \"gamer\" rigs we tested, the Falcon Northwest system gave us the least trouble. The only real issue we had was carving up the speaker cable for the over-the-top audio system Falcon sent us. But the company supplied us with a reel of premium speaker wire and a wire stripping tool, a testament to the level of detail demonstrated by the Falcon Northwest crew. The Falcon rig posted stellar mass storage benchmarks across the board, aided by the capabilities of the Ultra2 SCSI controller built onto the ASUS motherboard. The Falcon system also posted the highest 3D WinBench 99 scores we've seen. Falcon Northwest also wins the \"out-of-the-box\" award. After unpacking it and plugging it in, it ran without a hitch. All the DOS drivers were there, DirectX6 was up and running, and we had no serious crashes during all our testi ng. About the only odd confiquration item was the USB version of the CH F16 Combatstick. I mention this only in irony, as Falcon Northwest supplied a dedicated CH dual port gamecard along with the game port on the Diamond Monster Sound MX200. About the only thing they left out was a DVD drive and hardware decoder. The Mach V uses Falcon Northwest's standard midtower case, is quite easy to work inside, and comes configured with two additional cooling fans. It's a good thing, since the Obsidian X-24 can run pretty hot. In addition, Falcon overclocks the system bus slightly. running it at 103MHz instead of 100MHz. Still, we noticed no stability problems during testing. As a final note, Falcon Northwest definitely wins the eviction notice award.

"Full Throttle DALAW COMPUTER MING MEGAL GAME. 9 PRIMARY: 479  SECONDARY: NIA Micron Millennia beaner) Micron fired right up and gave us no headaches during testing. For gamers, Micron's Sound Blaster 128 gives it something of a disadvantage when compared to Dell, which uses Turtle Beach's Vortex2-based Montego Il card. If you changed the sound card, say, to a Vortex2-based board or Creative's Sound Blaster Live!, the choice between the Millennia and the Dell Dimension would become almost a coin toss (although the Dell Millennia is cheaper) Micron Millennia. $3,049. Micron, Nampa, ID. (800) 209-9686. www.micronpc.com PROS: Excellent 3D GameGauge performance, clean design, easy access. CONS: Sound Blaster 128, no Voodoo?; no bundled game controllers Speeds & Feeds speakers. For gamers, these choices present a curious trade-off. On the one hand, you've got a sound card that won't support A3D, and only has limited support for Creative's own EAX 3D audio standard. But this sound card talks to a goodsounding pair of speakers that can render two-speaker 3D audio very well. Because Micron and Dell have found the same case maker, both systems' innards are easily accessed, and because they use the same motherboard, system components are well laid out and easily reached The case has a pop-off panel that hides the system's internal EIDE Zip drive, and once you pop the case open, you'll probably never put it back on. Both systems use Intel's standard Phoenix BIOS, which allows for basic system tweaks, but which lacks the detailed settings of an Award BIOS. Staying true to form, the Micron performs well in most of our tests, with the one exception of its slow Business Disk WinMark score, which was the slowest of the lot. But Micron turned in the fastest 3D GameGauge score by a nose, just edging out Compaq and Dell. The M icron is a company that's flirtIVied with doing serious gaming boxes before. Its original Fusion 3D package featured a 3Dfx Voodoobased board, along with basic game controllers. But the company hasn't quite gotten the message across about its offerings to gamers. And with the arrival of nVidia's RIVA TNT chip (which finds a home in this Millennia), putting in a 3Dfx board has become less of an imperative, and is now more important for Glide support. Still, Micron produces a box with a simple, clean implementation that doesn't get in the way of whatever else you want to put in it. The rig features strong components, including Diamond's Viper 550 graphics card, an Intel motherboard, and 128MB of memory. In some ways, this box and the Dell Dimension are becoming indis. tinguishable: They both use the same case, the same CPU, the same graphics board, and the same keyboard. But Micron uses different audio components, including the Sound Blaster PCI 128 and, more notably, Monsoon Multimedia's new MM-1000 magnetic planar BIOS CPU .... RAM .. Motherboard.

"D Full Throttle et's face it, there are a lot of us who'd love to drive a Ferarri, but we wind up making our peace with driving a Ford. Usually, a gaming system with a $6,000 price tag and an intact marriage are mutually exclusive. This year the news on the Bang for the Buck front is very good, indeed. Instead of that \"Ford\" gaming rig being an Escort, it's a Mustang. Thanks to cheaper memory and CPU prices, we have lowered the price limit on these systems from $2,500 to $2,000 and still, the slowest CPU was a Pentium II/350MHz, which ain't too shabby. But the real stand-out here was Dell, whose Pentium 11/400MHz with a 16MB STB RIVA TNT board took top honors, and even nipped at the heels of the big boys. These boxes do cut a few corners, such as smaller monitors, less memory (64MB in lieu of 128MB), or smaller hard drives. The bottom line is that you can get yourself a very competent gaming box-minus some amenities—that won't leave you wearing a barrel. Alienware Hangar 18 AMEGA AUGE GAM * * * * * PRIMARY: 401 SECONDARY: 384 26 di COMMENOS Waw WV Speeds & Feeds in contrast to their well-hung Majestic Binary, Alienware's Hangar 18 offers good value at a reasonable price If it weren't for the headaches we encountered trying the get the S3 Savage 3D-based primary graphics card to work, we'd have liked the Hangar 18 a lot better. On paper, the Hangar 18 seems like a great system: It has a reasonably fast CPU, leading edge primary graphics, Voodoo? and a compelling audio solution. But the Hercules Terminator Beast AGP graphics card, which uses S3's Savage3D accelerator chip, proved to be an enormous headache. One set of drivers wouldn't run the benchmarks. The next set ran the benchmarks, but wouldn't run the games. The set after that crashed the benchmarks again. We finally got it to run, but even then, we saw dropped triangles in 3D WinBench 99. All in all, it's not an auspicious start for a system. The rest of the system seems pretty solid.The Hercules Stingray/2 Voodoo2 card fared better, posting the highest score for a single Voodoo2 of all the systems in 3D GameGauge. The Elan Vital T10-AB case has been modified with an additional cooling fan to keep the system humming along. As an aside, this is a great case that's very easy to get inside when you want to add new peripherals. The audio is certainly among the best of the low-end boxes: Cambridge's four-speaker PC Works setup ties in perfectly with the Sound Blaster Live card. The hard drive and CD-ROM seem a little light next to the 12GB/DVD equipped Dell system, though. But then, tradeoffs are what it's all about in a $2,000 computer, and Alienware's set of choices seems pretty reasonable-except for its primary graphics card. In fact, I'd say that the choice of primary graphics is what really hurt the Hangar 18's scores. On the surface, the Savage3D seems to be a fast 3D performer. (Its 2D performance is lacking, however.) We had so many headaches trying to get the Beast-an apt name if there ever was one running, that we suggest Alienware find another primary card. Only then would this be a compelling system. Alienware Hangar 18. $1,999. Alienware, Miami, FL. (800) 494-3382. www. alienware-pc.com PROS: Strong audio, Voodoo?.

"Full Throttle GAMING GAUS EDITORS CHOICE Dell Dimension XPS400 * * * * * GAMEG 9PRIMARY: 447 PM SECONDARY. NIA lvp3 GAMING ell is the undisputed king of the direct sellers, and the XPS400 is a good reason why it has managed to stay on top. This system was a delight to set up, install, and run, and the price point is astonishing. You get a 400MHz Pentium II, 96MB of SDRAM, and solid graphics and audio—all for under $2,000. The only quibble we have is the lack of Voodoo and the somewhat cheesy speaker system. The combination of the RIVA TNT-based Velocity 4400 and the 400MHz CPU simply blew away the low-end competition in the test scores. Both the synthetic benchmarks and the 3D GameGauge scores were higher than the other sub-$2,000 systems by a fairly wide margin. The downside is that you don't get Voodoo? for the $2,000 price. But if you really came across a 3Dfx-only game you just had to play, you could always add a Voodoo graphics card. As with all the Dell systems, setup was a snap, and the system hummed along with no major glitches. The only concern we have is that the 200-watt power supply may be anemic if you really start loading the How Low Can We Go? Dell down with a second hard drive and Voodoo SLI. (Though the 12GB hard drive should hold you for awhile.) Another concern is that the US Robotics Winmodem is a \"soft\" modem, meaning that the CPU plays a part when the modem is in use, So if Internet multiplayer gaming is in your future, you might consider upgrading the modem on this guy. Most of our concerns are pretty minor. Overall, the Dimension XPS400 is one helluva bargain, offers unmatched performance in its price class, and should serve as a solid platform for most gamers. Dell Dimension XPS400. $1,999. Dell Computer, Round Rock, TX. (800) 999-3355. www.dell.com PROS: Works out of the box; great price/performance value. CONS: No Voodoo', cheesy speakers. Speeds & Feeds f you have a fat wallet, it's easy to get a fast system. But what if you don't have a fat wallet? What if even $2,000 is too rich for your blood? We recently went through the exercise of assembling a couple of systems for under $1,500. One used the 300MHZ version of AMD's K6-2 and the other used Intel's 333MHZ Celeron-A CPU. In both cases, we were able to build systems including a 17-inch monitor that performed reasonably well for under $1,500. Except for the motherboard and CPUs, the systems were identical. Common components included 64MB of PC100 compliant SDRAM, a 5.7GB Maxtor hard drive, a Diamond Monster Fusion AGP board (which uses the 3Dfx Voodoo Banshee chipset), and an Optiquest Q71 monitor. An 10Magic Vortex-based sound card and a set of Cambridge Soundworks PC Works speakers handled audio chores. The K6-2 system ran on an ASUS P5A motherboard, which uses the ALi Alladin V chipset, whereas we popped the Celeron-A into an Abit BH6 motherboard. Both boards have one AGP and five PCI slots, plus a couple of ISA slots, and should have performance that's more than adequate for most games. If we can build these systems for $1,500, then it's clear that the big resellers should be able to offer decent gaming systems for under $1,500-or even less. Most sub $1,200 systems we've seen have some serious compromises somewhere either the graphics cards are terribly slow, the speakers tinny, or the monitor minuscule. Of course, another use for a good $1,200 system would be for that second system in your house. That way, multiplayer becomes that much easier.

"Full Throttle Gateway G6-350 * * * * * or the Bang for the Buck I roundup, Gateway sent us a Pentium 11/350MHz box that's a pretty solid system, except that it marries you to Gateway's graphics card choice by putting the chip down on the motherboard with no AGP slot for future upgrades. To the company's credit, this flaw is mitigated by the presence of an STB Voodoo board, but it's still an unfortunate design decision. The G6-350 is pretty much a garden-variety beige box, but it's accessed easily enough by removing a single thumb screw. Once inside, we made the unhappy discovery that this rig has an AGP RIVA 128zx with 8MB of video memory down on the motherboard. This is unfortunate because there is a design option for graphics called \"3-way AGP\" that allows for a motherboard-down graphics chip as well as an AGP slot for a future upgrades, but in an effort to keep the price down, Gateway didn't opt for this design. The good news here is that right next to where an AGP slot should be is STB's Black Magic 3D Voodoo board, which ably handles 3D graphics chores-although it can't run at 1024x768 double-buffered with a z-buffer. Gateway's audio choices are hit and miss. The hit is Boston Acoustics' impressive BA635s, which are just about the most impressive low-cost speakers we've heard. But the missis Creative's Sound Blaster AudioPCI-a revamped version on Ensonia's very basic PCI audio chip, which supports neither ABD nor Creative's own EAX standard, and it does most of its DirectSound \"acceleration\" on the CPU. Gateway gets clearly outgunned by the other two entrants, due in large part to the RIVA 128zx's underwhelming performance relative to the Dell's RIVA TNT and Alienware's Savage 3D-based parts. Gateway's poor performance is attributable to two things: First, RIVA 128zx's driver doesn't allow V-sync to be disabled, so part of its low 3D GameGauge score is caused by refresh rate issues. Second, RIVA 128zx has about onethird the fill rate of RIVA TNT, and this also shows up in the numbers. However, for secondary 3D graphics performance, Gateway was neck-and-neck with Alienware, which also has a Voodoo2 board and a 350MHz Pentium II CPU. In the Fill-Rate Torture Test, the Gateway's graphics driver gave an error message saying it couldn't get a proper texture format. Despite a few bright moments, Gateway's sub-S2000 offering makes too many compromises to be an effective gaming box. With a few tweaks, Gateway could have a winner on its hands, but until it addresses the G6-350's shortcomings, you may want to pass. Gateway G6-350. 51,698. Gateway, North Souix City, SD. (800) 846-4208. www.gateway.com PROS: Easy access; great speakers; Voodoo board. CONS: Motherboard-down \"permanent\" graphics; RIVA 128zx no longer stacks up well; weak sound card choice. CGW AMEGA S PRIMARY: 181.4 SECONDARY: 381 DED: 392 baw We GAMING Bottom Line Time Speeds & Feeds f you've got the bucks, the prime choice is still Falcon Northwest's Mach V system. This year Falcon Northwest has shipped us a slightly more conservative systemno RAID array, no DVD drive. Instead, we got a solid, high-performance system that ran without any glitches. As a runner-up, the Dell Dimension XPS450 turned out some solid benchmark numbers and ran flawlessly. About the only thing, we'd add to it would be a Voodoocard or two. This year's Bleeding Edge award goes to Alienware. We admire its attempt to push the envelope, but we ran into some annoying glitches. The frequent crashes of the EIDE RAID array were particularly worrisome. Compaq gets the Most Improved award, shipping a serious 3D accelerator for the first time, and it can even be upgraded. On the low end, the clear winner is the Dell XPS400. For just under $2,000, you get a 400MHz CPU, RIVA TNT, 12GB of harddrive space, and lots of memory. Again, Alienware gets some nods for trying to push the envelope a bit, but we were quite disappointed with the performance and glitches exhibited by the Terminator Beast graphics card. Gateway's low-end system was disappointing because its adequate, but aging, primary graphics can't be upgraded. So if you have a healthy budget, then take a look at the Falcon Northwest Mach V. If you're budget is tighter, the Dell XPS400 looks like a real winner-but you may need to add Voodoo. CPU ........

But SLi has IRON WORKS been out of reach for some gamers because of its daunting price tag, which was about $600-700 when Voodoo2 first shipped. Well, it seems that Voodoo2 board-maker Guillemot International is having an SLI fire sale, offering dual 12MB Voodoo2 boards for $229. This fortuitous price drop was precipitated by the arrival of 3Dfx's own Banshee 2D/3D chipset, as well as nVidia's RIVA TNT chipset, which compare favorably to Voodoo. But where TNT and Banshee both trail is versus Voodoo2 SLI. Voodoo2 SLI does have a few limitations: First, it will run only in 16-bit color, which for almost all current games is fine, but 1999 may well be the year game makers switch to using 32-bit true-color artwork, and Voodoo2 will have to dither this down to 16-bit. Also, SLI's maximum resolution is 1024x768, which is plenty for now, but RIVA TNT can run at higher resolutions, and ATI's forthcoming Rage 128 chipset will do the same. What's interesting is that thus far, Guillemot is the only board maker making the $229 SLI proposition. Other Voodoo2 board makers such as STB, Diamond, and Creative Labs have all dropped their Voodoo2 board prices, either by straight price drop or with rebate coupons. Other board makers will probably follow Guillemot's lead this holiday season.Dave Salvator Intel IA-64 This new 64-bit CPU will use a new set of Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) instructions and use a technology termed EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) to execution of instructions in parallel.

"The Lord of the CPU The More Things Change... \"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\" -J.R.R. Tolkien, Lord of the Rings upgraded to a 440BX motherboard with PC100 compliant memory, you can step up to the next generation CPU from Intel simply by swapping CPUs. The Best of Times, the Worst of Times As you read this, Intel is readying its successor to the now-venerable Pentium II. The code name is Katmai, and it ometimes it seems that the PC on my desk is like the One Ring, Sauron's ring from The Lord of the Rings. Over time, it becomes an obsession, sometimes to the detriment of fiscal or physical health. It beckons you late at night when you're best off sleeping, but instead you find yourself wandering over to the glowing screen, as if it is beckoning you in some irresistible fashion. Someone suggests that maybe you don't need that next upgrade and you find yourself snarling, \"My precious!\" Okay, so I'm exaggerating. In fact, these engines of entertainment we call personal computers have become as much a part of our lives as cars were to a previous generation. So it's time to peer into the crystal ball for the upcoming year and try to figure out upgrade strategies. delivers a slew of enhancements to the Pentium II architecture. It's still pretty much the P6 core at heart, but there's a radical enhancement to the old MMX technology known as Katmai New Instructions (KNI). We've written about Katmai elsewhere. Suffice it to say that it should accelerate the kind of math needed for 3D geometry calculations 100-200 percent faster than a Pentium II. The good news is that the first release of Katmai will be a slot one CPU. That means it should plug into most motherboards that use Intel's 440BX chipset. You may need a BIOS update from the board manufacturer, but that's about it. Katmai will initially ship as a 450MHz CPU with a 500MHz part to ship a bit later. This means that if you've followed my past advice, and So Much for the Good News Late in the year, PC technology will change radically. For the industry, it's good news, because it will generate a whole slew of new upgrades. For those of us that feel compelled to keep up with the Jonses, it's bad news, because it means we'll have to shell out more hard-earned dollars. For one thing, the difference in performance between low-end and and highend systems will start to get wider again. In the past few months, tech savvy users have upgraded to Pentium II class systems by getting Celeron or LOYD CASE Katmai can accelerate the kind of math needed for 3D geometry calculations 100-200 percent faster than a Pentium II. The Computer Gaming World Reference System ne of the problems we here at CGW wrestle with is how to present review information in a usable way. One of the other editors pointed out that it was difficult, for example, to choose a graphics card because the system the cards are tested on would vary from one issue to another. That makes it nearly impossible to compare the performance of one product to another. Because of this, we decided it was time to create a baseline system on which all our hardware reviews would be conducted. So I'd like to present to you the Computer Gaming World Reference System. We'll use this for all our performance-oriented product testing over the next 9-12 months. In the list at right is the gear we brought together for the system. Since our performance-oriented testing, such as graphics cards, will be run on this system throughout most of the year, you'll be able to compare performance of different products in an intelligent way. It's just another way of providing you with the information you need to make an informed buying decision.

"LOYD CASE These engines of entertainment we call personal computers have become as much a part of our lives as cars were to a previous generation. HARDW extent, you see this today, but the capabilities will be much more sophisticated Celeron-A CPUs and clocking them up so they glow like the One Ring tossed into a fire. But although the Celeron line will step up to the 100MHz system bus in 1999, there will be no Celeron with Katmai New Instructions. Celeron itself will be changing. Future Celerons will be chip based, and will plug into-get this-yet another socket format. No, it's not socket 7. It's not socket 8. It's socket-A. The Dawning of a New Age in Predictions so it looks like my general advice to build systems with upgrades in mind may change by the end of 1999. At that point, it may be better to buy a new PC than to upgrade an existing one. My big fear is that PCs will become like modern cars. Ever try to \"tune up\" a car with an onboard computer and fuel injection? At any rate, 1999 will be an interesting time for PC users and gamers. The only thing we can do now is wait to see what pans out and how much thinner our wallets will get. Now, where's that damned volcano? CGW Tech Tips The Once and Future PC One discussion at the Intel Developer forum went into great length on the wonders and benefits of software audio. In other words, instead of having a sound card, you'd have the CPU process all audio data. Intel suggested that on a 300MHz Pentium II, \"233MHz will be free after audio processing.\" Gee, and I thought with all these hardware accelerators coming out for 3D graphics and audio, we'd finally have some spare CPU cycles for game Al and physics. Intel thinks otherwise, and would just as soon you use those CPU cycles for sound processing-meaning if you want better performance, you pay more money for a faster CPU. Guess what: Soft audio will be targeted for low-end ($1,000) systems. Core gamers willing to shell out bucks will of course get a Katmai CPU and a PCI sound card with DirectSound acceleration. The performance difference between high end and low end will get even greater. Intel also wants to eliminate legacy hardware-which means no more ISA bus. While this will cause some financial pain for people who might buy a \"legacy free\" system, it means, in the long run, better performance and easier upgrading. This is one change that I'm applauding. Then there's Rambus DRAM (RDRAM). RDRAM is a new memory technology that promis. es to speed up the rate at which data is moved between memory and the CPU. Coupled with Katmai's streaming memory technology, we may see system bus speeds of 133MHz, 200MHz, or more. Of course, it means that if you upgrade to a RDRAMcapable motherboard and you want to use RDRAM, you get to throw away all that SDRAM you bought. There is a bit of good news: Those motherboards should also support SDRAM, easing the transition a bit. As 1999 draws to a close, we'll see the appearance of FireWire (IEEE 1394) as a disk interface in PCs, supplanting both IDE and SCSI, FireWire will be faster than either, and can support hot swappable hard drives. To complement this, a new technology called device bay may start to appear on PCS by year's end. Today, installing a hard drive or CD-ROM means turning off the system, opening the case, removing the hard drive, screwing in the new one, and so on. With device bay, you just pop the old drive out from the front of the case and slip in the new one. Power management will change, too. Today, we have fairly crude setups, with modest abilities to go to low-power state. Future PCs will never be completely turned off (like newer model televisions). Instead, when you hit the power switch, the system will go into a very low-power state. Pressing the power switch again brings the system back up. To some My multiplayer games seem to have some lag over a local area network. Is there anything I can do to improve performance? There are a couple of things you can do. First, if you're using TCP/IP, and you don't have to a network administrator to worry about, hard code your IP addresses. If this is an internal-only LAN, you can set the addresses to 192.168.0.xxx, where xxx can range from 1 to 255. Set the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0. Second, unbind your IPX protocol from file and print sharing. You can do this by going into the network control panel and unchecking the boxes for file sharing and print sharing in the IPX protocol property sheet. If you have TCP/IP enabled (and you should), then you'll still have file sharing and print sharing, but overall performance during IPX net gaming should improve, since the network isn't trying to do two things at once. TCP/IP games don't seem to be affected. aldster Help! I just installed Frontpage 98 and now I have problems connecting with Compuserve! Frontpage 98 has the nasty habit of installing an older copy of Winsock, even if you're running Windows 98. The only thing to do is load the newer version of Winsock off the Windows 98 CD. The Windows 98 WINSOCK.DLL file is in the file PRECOPY1.CAB in \\win98 on the Windows 98 install CD. You can get it by using the extract command from a DOS window: extract /a x:\\precopy1.cab winsock.dll / c:\\windows\\system (where \"x\" is your CDROM's drive letter). www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 281 "

"REVIEW  INTEL PENTIUM II OVERDRIVE PROCESSOR Pentium II OverDrive Processor intel More Power, Scotty HARDWARE by Dave Salvator ntel's Pentium Pro processor enjoyed only a short stint as the company's flagship, getting quickly overshadowed by the Pentium Il onslaught. If you got a Pentium Pro-equipped box when they came out, you're probably thinking about upgrading your CPU and motherboard. Well, Intel has another option for you to consider: a Socket 8 Pentium II OverDrive. Speed grades for 180MHz and 200MHz Pentium Pros are 300MHz and 333MHz, respectively. Intel says that this OverDrive will be the last one in its product line and will effectively turn a Pentium Pro box into a Xeon machine. Like Intel's Xeon, the OverDrive's 512KB L2 cache runs at the CPU's full clock speed, whi things along faster. But also like Xeon, this upgrade option is expensive. In fact, you can find a Pentium || 400MHz CPU and a motherboard for less than OverDrive's $550 cost. On WinBench 99's CPU tests, OverDrive clearly outpaces Pentium COMPUTER GAMING ***** WORLD PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS Pro, with an 82 percent speedup in integer performance and a 66 percent bump in floating-point performance. In 3D WinBench 99, OverDrive was 58 percent in the Transform and Lighting test, a CPUintensive test that measures how fast triangles can be transformed and lit in Direct3D. These numbers seem to make OverDrive a winner, but on 3D GameGauge the 24 percent speedup is less impressive. Theoretical performance is fine, but OverDrive's real game performance doesn't warrant its price tag. After the upgrade, you still have a 66MHz system memory bus, a 33MHz PCI bus, and no way to add AGP. If you can't part with your Socket 8 motherboard, OverDrive will breathe new life into your rig. But you'd do better to swap in an AGP motherboard and a new Pentium Il processor. CGW APPEAL: Gamers with Pentium Pro boxes who want more speed without a motherboard swap. PROS: Ups performance about 25 per cent on games; easy installation; adds MMX CONS: Still uses Pentium Pro's 440FX chipset; no AGP; potential compatibility problems; very expensive compared to other upgrade options.

Getting clean, loud output from satellites with two-inch drivers has COMPUTER GAMING *** ** WORLD become commonplace, with impressive offerings from both Boston Acoustics and Cambridge SoundWorks. But there's another approach. Using magnetic planar technology licensed from Eminent Technologies (makers of the impressive LFT-11s) along with its own manufacturing process, Monsoon Multimedia produces a speaker system featuring flat-panel satellites and a woofer/amplifier that deliver impressive audio for a little over $200. Now, this may seem pricey relative to Boston Acoustics' and Cambridge's offerings, both of which are under $100. However, compared to Eminent's LFT-11s, the Monsoons look like a pretty good deal. Setup is pretty straightforward. The only kludge in the design is the \"hockey puck\" volume control. The sparse documentation claims this control will allow you to control volume and mute the speakers, but I was only able to do the latter, toggling between mute and blastissimo. Even if it had worked as advertised, it's not intuitive. The controls on the front of the woofer cabinet let you tweak overall volume, bass level, and what Monsoon terms \"punch,\" which boosts the 55Hz band 6dB for added bass response. Now we get to the good part. The Monsoons sound terrific, with the very \"tight\" imaging typical of magnetic planar speakers. This makes for a focused \"sweet spot,\" where stereo imaging is precise and well placed—as is 3D positional audio. Overall sound quality is solid throughout the audible fre. quency range, although there's no granular control for treble settings, and the high-frequency part of the signal becomes less discernible if you move out of the sweet spot. Audio CDs ranging from Beethoven to Cassandra Wilson sounded APPEAL: Gamers looking to soup up their audio. PROS: Terrific overall sound; ample volume; boomin' bass; affordable magnetic planar design. CONS: Volume control doesn't work well; still a little pricey compared to Cambridge PC Works and Boston Acoustics 635s Price: 5229 Manufacturer: Monsoon Multimedia (877) PCAUDIO www.sonigistix.com great, and gaming audio was equally beefy. 3D positional audio from a Vortex2 reference board was rendered well. Thanks to Monsoon's 50-watt amplifier, these units can be cranked up pretty loud before there's any perceptible distortionlouder than either the Cambridge or Boston Acoustics low-cost units. Overall, the Monsoons bring a lot together. They have great audio quality, and they make magnetic planar technology more affordable. These speakers are now finding homes in Micron's newest systems. If you're in the market for a pair of solid speakers, maybe they should find a home in your rig too. CGW photo: Michael Falconer 206 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"REVIEW. REVIEW: ACT FORCE RS GAMING Costs Less, More Filling EDITORS CHOICE HARDWARE by Loyd Case magine a force-feedback wheel for under $140. That's not much more than some midrange analog steering wheels. Richmond, BC-based ACT Labs has managed to pull off a real coup with the Force RS. Not only is COMPUTER GAMING WORLD this wheel cheaper than the competition, it's in some ways better. The first thing you notice is the grip. The genuine, simulated fine Corinthian leatherlike wrap around the padded wheel just feels right. There are seven buttons along the front face of the wheel and a pair of paddle shifters. Cosmetically, the wheel is slick, a touch subdued, and even a bit dangerous looking. The wheel plugs into a free serial port, which can be a problem for some users. But you'll be able to upgrade easily to the USB plug-in cartridge, which will be around $25 when it ships. Another big plus is the pedal base. The ACT Labs pedal set is easily the best I've used in a low-cost wheel, and the base never moved on my carpeted floor. The angle and resistance of the gas and brake pedals feels just right, too. I spent a lot of time with EA's NEED FOR SPEED III and can report that the forces generated by this wheel feel about right. They're not so strong that they wrench the wheel out of your hands, but you definitely feel it when you collide head-on. The level of resistance in normal road handling felt good, and the belt-driven motor didn't feel quite as \"notchy\" as the Microsoft wheel. I also boot. ed up the INTERSTATE 76 NITRO PACK and was pleasantly surprised to get some force feedback out of the game since it was tuned for Microsoft's wheel. About the only fault I found is the mounting brackets. While this worked reasonably well on a flat desktop, when used on a folding (** APPEAL: Price conscious gamers looking for a force-feedback wheel. PROS: Good grip on wheel; great pedals; solid feel. CONS: Serial port required (USB version to ship soon). REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 90 with free serial port. Price: $139 Manufacturer: ACT Labs (800) 980-9997 www.actlab.com table I have with supporting ridges under the tabletop. the wheel didn't seat all the way forward, which made it a bit wobbly. Still, the mounting gear is easy to use and should work with most desktops. All in all, the Force RS is a real winner. The only downside is that ACT Labs doesn't have the distribution muscle of a Microsoft, so you'll have to order it direct. If you like arcade racing and even get into racing simulators in a casual way, you owe it to yourself to give this a whirl. CGW Photo: Michael Falconer REVIEW.CELERON 333-A intel. Intel's Baby Pentium II celeron by Loyd Case irst of all, let's dispense with the overclocking question. Yes, you can overclock a Celeron-A. If you do, it will always run at a fixed multiplier of the bus speed. The 300MHz part will run at 450MHz if the bus speed is 100MHz. The 333MHz part will run at 500MHz. It may be stable, but it may not. CGW generally doesn't recommend this degree of overclocking, but if you do, be aware of the risks. If you do want to experiment with over clocking, the 300MHz part may be more stable. Now, let's assume for the moment that we'll be running our Celeron-A at the rated clock speed, 333MHz, and that the system bus is set to 66MHz. How does the Celeron-A compare against the 350MHz Pentium II which costs about $110 more at the time of this writing? for $110 less, it compares reasonably well. As we expected, the CPUMark 32 scores were somewhat less, as were the FPUMark scores from WinBench 99. The big surprise was the 3D GameGauge scores. The 350MHz Pentium II clocked in at 447 for 3D GameGauge, whereas the Celeron-A eked out just under COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 380-about 15 percent slower. Note that everything except the CPU was identical—we simply swapped in the CPU and set the correct clock speed. (We tested on an Abit BH6 motherboard with 64MB of SDRAM and an STB Velocity 4400 graphics card.) In other words, for a third less money, you get 15 percent less performance, which seems like a reasonable tradeoff. So even if you're not into overclocking, the Celeron-A, with its 128KB of Level 2 cache running at the full speed of the CPU, may be a good deal. It will not, however, break any performance records. CGW PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS 3371 566 43B APPEAL: Users on a tight budget looking for near-Pentium Il performance. PROS: It's cheap CONS: Unless you're into overclocking, it's not all that fast.

"REVIEW  LOGITECH SOUNDMAN EXTREME Soundman Extreme-ly Bland by Loyd Case hen I first saw the Logitech Soundman Extreme, the first thought that entered my head was \"Labtech.\" That was a somewhat uncharitable assessment. On the surface, the HARDWARE COMPUTER Soundman Extreme vaguely resembles some of Labtech's speakers. But the Soundman cost more, and they sound better. Having said that, let me add that these speakers don't sound great For $149, you would expect some thing pretty solid. I ran a bunch of music CDs to get a feel for the overall balance and clarity of the Soundman speakers, and I found them wanting for playing musical material. Sharp acoustic guitar attacks sound flabby, and vocal sibilants sound overly exaggerated. Despite Logitech's claims of fre quency response down to 28Hz, the deep bass response was practically nonexistent. All this sounds dismal, but the speakers do excel in a couple of areas. Stereo imaging is very good, which is a must with HRTF 3D positional audio schemes like Aureal's ABD. The speakers seem to have a midrange emphasis, which means that speech material sounds prominent. This is handy in games, where the speech is often mixed down in the mud of the background sounds. So despite the lack of musical fidelity, these speakers don't sound half bad with games. The speakers themselves are very compact. Two satellites take up very little room on your desktop. But the bass unit is almost tiny, so it's no surprise that the bass output is anemic. Setup is easy, and there's no power brick since the power module is integrated into the bass module. Overall, the Soundman Extreme is a decent, though unspectacular first effort from a company known more for pointing devices and WORLD ***** APPEAL: Loyal Logitech customers or those gamers who can't find any other decent speakers PROS: Decent game audio; very easy to set up. CONS: Underwhelming bass output muddy music. Price: 5149 (manufacturer list price) Manufactuter: Logitech (510) 795-8500 game controllers. But there are better speakers that cost less, like the Cambridge SoundWorks PC Works and the Boston Acoustics BA635s. In comparison, Logitech's Soundman Extreme seems like a wan debutante wallflower compared to the prom-queen presence of the BA635's. CGW photo: Michael Falconer www.logitech.com REVIEW PROTON MM7501 Sight and Sound by Loyd Case ultimedia monitors with built-in speakers and microphones seem attractive at first glance. Wouldn't it be great to have PC display, speakers, and microphone all in one compact COMPUTER WORLE package? The Proton MM750i comes close-closer than other socalled multimedia monitors. But it falls short of its aspirations. Unpacking and setting up proved to be something of a chore. The swivel base was a pain to attach. The monitor ships with audio cables, but they are very short. As a nod to the user with gothic taste, the monitor ships in a black version as well as beige. Once past the cabling hurdle, the MM750 proved to be a capa ble, if unspectacular, 17-inch moni tor. With a 15.8-inch viewing area, it offers a fairly low bandwidth supporting a scant 65Hz refresh rate at 1280x1024. At a more rea sonable 1024x768, the Proton managed an 85Hz refresh rate. We did notice a slight moiré pattern in Windows, though not in gameplay. Controls are simple, with the now-familiar \"wheel button\" on the front of the screen. Press the wheel, and the onscreen display pops up. Rotate the wheel, and you can select your option and adjust speaker volume. The good news about the speakers is that they don't suck. The bad news is, they don't sound nearly as good as a pair of standalone speakers. The monitor's bass unit has an odd, vertical tube protruding out of the right rear corner and has its own 14-watt amplifier The satellites share an 8-watt amplifier, but they're side-firing, rather than front-facing and have a \"3D audio\" effect built in that isn't true positional audio. Instead, the effect widens the sound stage; but it can't be disabled, so there's * * * * * always some reverb, and the sound is never completely clean. Music played through the Proton tends to sound artificial. Games fare much better, and the unit pumps out a surprisingly loud volume. Bass came off subdued—there's only so much you can do with a four-inch woofer. If you're tight on dollars and desk space, you might consider the Proton—especially if you don't play audio CDs on your computer. The picture quality is decent, and the audio isn't awful. But if you can, get stand-alone speakers and a separate monitor. Your ears will be most grateful. CGW APPEAL: Users with limited space and modest audio needs who want a 17-inch monitor. PROS: Decent audio for built-in speakers. CONS: Slight, but noticeable moiré pattern throughout the display at high resolutions in Windows Price: 5399 Manufacturer: Proton Cerritos, CA photo: Michael Falconer www.proton-usa.com www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"REVIEW THE INTENSOR CHAIR Ass-inine Peripheral HUARAWDA : by Loyd Case survived the VFX-1 virtual reality helmet, having nearly ripped out my ears straying too far from the PC to which it was tethered. I survived an exploding network interface card, having removed my head from the inside of the case only seconds COMPUTER GAMNG ***** WORLD before it self-destructed. I've even survived lifting 21-inch monitors. But I nearly didn't survive the Intensor. After only a half-hour in this baby, I felt like I had three compressed vertebrae, I had whacked my funny bone three times on the so-called armrests, and I nearly blew out my eardrums when I rolled the chair back and yanked out the all-too-short tether from the amplifier. The result was a huge popping sound that left my ears ringing. If you get the intensor, skip getting the base. The Intensor itself isn't too difficult to set up, but installing it into the five-wheel pedestal nearly reduced two grown men to tears. Attaching the armrests proved an interesting exercise in puzzle solving. Worse, the chair is easier to install in its folded position (since it would fall over any way), but the armrests prevent the unit from unfolding once installed On top of all this, it sounds terrible. The speakers sound tinny and flat, and the bass is pretty pathetic. Even with the subwoofer active, there wasn't a lot of bass rumble, and musical content sounded abysmal. Gameplay wasn't particularly enhanced either. The Intensor may simply be poorly suited for modern PC games. Many games are coming out with 3D audio support via DirectSound3D, Creative's EAX, or Aureal's A3D positional audio, and the Intensor completely screws up the imaging in 3D audio. I played around with A3D settings, even changing to headphones, but the 3D effect was either lost or ren dered incorrectly by the position of the speakers in the chair. Controls are pretty basic, with a power APPEAL: People who buy products based on the way they look. PROS: It looks like an alien chair from a Star Trek episode.

CGW REVIEW  NASCAR SPRINT RACING WHEEL EAMING Easy Rider EDITORS: CHOICE by Jeff \"I Can't Drive 45\" Green hate hardware, and hardware hates me. Take any functioning piece of computer equipment, give it to me, and sit back as springs fly, circuits short, and all sorts of other bad voodoo goes down. This is why I was asked to review Thrust Master's NASCAR Sprint Racing Wheel, an ultra-cheap, low-end steering COMPUTER wheel aimed squarely at first-time wheel buyers. Since a chimpanzee wasn't available, I was the next best thing to the ultimate hardware-impaired gamer. This wheel delivers on its promises. I had the Sprint Racing Wheel set up, installed, and ready to race in about three minutes. It's nearly Plug-and-Play—all you have to do is attach the enclosed clamps to the wheel, fasten the wheel to your desk, and plug the cord into your gameport. Software installation is just as simple. An install CD basically takes care of everything for you, including a superintuitive, visual calibration before you use the wheel for the first time. The Sprint Racing Wheel's footprint is much smaller than higherend wheels, making it a convenient, practical choice for those with a cramped workspace. Happily, the smaller footprint does not in any way lessen the GAMING *** WORLD quality of the driving experience the wheel itself is small but solid and has a rock-steady feel to it as you drive. I've played with much more expensive wheels that didn't feel nearly as good as this one. There are four programmable buttons on the Sprint Racing Wheel (as opposed to just two on Thrustmaster's higher-end NASCAR Pro Racing Wheel). There are two levers underneath the wheel that can be either mapped as buttons or as throttle and brake controls depending on whether you want to use the Sprint Racing Wheel's enclosed pedals. And this leads to the product's only serious flaw—these pedals suck. The pedal unit is small and flimsy, is easily knocked over, and the pedals themselves are so tiny that it's a struggle not to press both at once. Fortunately, the levers on the wheel work quite wellbecause you'll definitely want to use these instead of the pedals. As long as you can handle the compromise of either using no pedals or lousy pedals, the NASCAR Sprint Racing Wheel is a great first steering wheel. It's cheap, easy-to-use, and has the high-quality feel of more expensive ThrustMaster products. For those new to the driving game, it's a solid choice. CGW APPEAL: Newbie PC drivers looking for their first wheel. PROS: Simple installation and calibra tion; small footprint, low price point CONS: Tiny pedals from hell.

"REVIEW  VIEWSONIC VP150 Flat-Out Beautiful PAMING HARDWARE by Loyd Case 've been skeptical of flat-panel displays for gamers, but this one made me a convert. I'm used to laptop displays that either shrink or get horribly distorted when the resolution changes, but this is no longer a problem.

The VP150 is an analog flat panel display that works with any graphics card. It's not a digital flat panel and thus doesn't require a special graphics card. There's none of the usual distortion associated with tube displays, such as pincushioning, misconvergence, or trape zoid adjustments. Setup is straightforward-unpack it, plug in the VGA and power cables, and turn it on. I did have to hunt for the cleverly hidden power switch, though. (It's on the right side.) Although it's only a 15-inch display, it's a true 15 inches diagonally and somehow feels bigger. There's no tube to hide under the bezel, so it's really equivalent to a mythical 16-inch tube-based display. It's so flat that at first it appears concave if you're used to standard monitors. One concern with LCD displays in the past was the limited viewing angle. Viewsonic specs the viewing angle at 140 degrees horizontal, but it does start to fade a bit after being about 45 degrees off center. Still, for most uses that's not an issue. The picture itself is bright and steady, and in a close visual inspection, I noticed no dark spots-pretty impressive for a 1024x769 LCD. Clearly, LCDs have improved a great deal over the last several years. put the monitor through its paces by running QUAKE II and CIVILIZATION II through a number of different resolutions. I was very impressed. Even when running QUAKE Il at 320x240. the VP150 displayed the image full screen.

At 640x480 and higher, there wasn't any noticeable image degradation. The maximum supported resolution is 1024x768 at 75Hz, but there's no noticeable flicker at that setting. The VP150 is a great answer for tight desktops, provided you can afford it and can live with its 15inch size.

The Stalkers are a creepy, spiderlike enemy that can easily dodge most projectile weapons by hopping from the floor to the ceiling. Their trickiest feat is playing dead, so you need to gib them. These pests are pretty much the coolest enemy in the game. by Thierry Nguyen ou gotta love a severed head. Especially the severed head of a Tank Commander, one of the mightiest foes in the QUAKE Il bestiary. Now, before you rush off to stuff and mount that bad boy for proud display in your den, there's something you'll need to do-pick up that bloody melon and use its lifeless eyes to get past a retinal scanner in the Stroggos base that you've infiltrated. That's what I call good, clean fun, and it's just one of the cooler things you get to do in the new QUAKE II MISSION PACK: GROUND ZERO. 1020 1722 23 DIRTY FIGHTER With his rail gun, machine guns, and grenade launcher, it almost isn't fair that the Carrier also has nasty Flyers that he can launch to kill you. Smart Monsters Deadly Monsters The biggest improvement to the single-player game is the Al. Rogue COMPUTER GAMING WORLD ***** Reach Out and Kill Someone The rest of the improvements are tuned specifically for multiplayer (see \"Multiple Mutilation\" sidebar for specific goodies). For one thing, there are three all-new weapons. The first is a chain saw, à la DOOM. In single-player mode, it's effective only against the soldiers, but it makes for a nice\" have bragging rights\" kill during a multiplayer game. The ETF Rifle is essentially a nail gun that shoots explosive-tipped fléchettes. It's pretty mediocre in the single-player game but shines in a DeathMatch; its armor-piercing rounds completely ignore armor and pound at your enemy's health, weakening the tactic of getting 200+ armor. The Plasma Beam, which shoots a concentrated light beam, is the last new weapon and the best of the lot. It's similar to a lightning gun although it chews up cells a bit slower than its QUAKE inspiration and has unlimited range. One gun that didn't quite make the cut was the Disruptor (the negative-light gun), which was demonstrated in preview versions of the game. However, Rogue has said that the Disruptor is still being tinkered with and will probably be offered as a free download once the designers work out the kinks. For now, the only place you'll see the Disruptor is in the hands of the game's final boss. The other additions are really modifications. There's the aforementioned Tesla Mine as well as Entertainment took QUAKE II's core a Tesla Mine, it's set to shoot a Al and tweaked it to make enemies lightning-type bolt at any nearby more effective.

"QUAKE II MISSION PACK: GROUND ZERO  REVIEW Multiple Mutilations Rogue has added quite a few items to the DeathMatch menu. Here's a quick guide to what these items do: ACTION. Defender Sphere This sphere gives support fire via a modified blaster and absorbs half the damage from any attack directed to you. Vengeance Sphere When your heath drops to 25 percent, the Vengeance Sphere fires on your attacker enough that the attacker reaches that 25 percent figure. 1111+ AR121* KILL BUGS DEAD The spiderlike Stalkers will play dead. So make sure you blow them to tiny bits lest they play dead and attack you once your back is turned. Hunter Sphere The best one of the lot, it can also be called the Mutually Assured Frag Sphere. If you die while this is active, the sphere homes in and obliterates whoever just killed you. Revenge is sweet, indeed. Antimatter Bomb The \"Up yours, everyone!\" nuke. Drop it, and it starts beeping; after about five seconds, it explodes, heavily damaging-if not outright killing-any. one within the blast radius. Best used in a crowded room where people may not notice the beeping. IR Goggles They give a reddish tinge and make items such as weapons, power-ups, and enemies, bright red. It's usefulness is limited and is chiefly good for spotting campers who hide in dark corners. Doppelganger This is an improvement on the DUKE NUKEM 3D model. Not just a mere replica, this clone image will instantly kill anyone who attacks it. They're generally well designed, but have one common flaw: They're too big. You can tell Rogue had the Internet crowd in mind by creating maps that cater to crowds of 8-16 players. It's IT SLICES, IT DICES The best new weapon, the a nice thought Plasma Beam, is perfect for neatly cutting through enemies, such as the Medic but impractical Commander. for those on a local network with a few buddies. You spend too much time just trying to find each other. Despite that, levels such as The Razor's Edge, The Road to Nowhere, and Rogue's own version of The Edge make for fun fragfests. MORE GUNS, LESS FUN While the Turrets are a nice addition to the Stroggos world, there are too many of them in most of the levels. The result is a less enjoyable game. within each unit.

And then there's GROUND ZERO is kind of a mixed that lovely severed head. bag.

The Carrier seems to have a ARMOR DIVISION, and STARCRAFT. Here We Go Again The single-player game could use some work, though. For one thing, it's a bit too much QUAKE II. That is, you're still running around various warehouses, hangars, and storage depots while shooting up the populace. With textures that are generally the same as those in the original QUAKE II, the game gives you a \"been there, done that feeling. The design itself is basically equal to QUAKE II, although it's less linear, since you must run back and forth among the various levels proximity grenades, which made an appearance back in SCOURGE OF ARMAGON. One nice detail about these is that they explode when placed near a respawn point in multiplayer, so you can't get any cheap frags that way.

"Multi MCA Mayhem Here's a quick guide to the different MCAs and how they handle for multiplayer purposes. Akuma The fastest but frailest of the four, this is the MCA of the lurking one. If you favor hitand-run tactics and can reasonably dodge incoming fire, you may like the Akuma. LCTLON Enforcer 1000 1350 PUT ON YOUR LEAD SUITS The weapon effects, such as from this nuke, are much more visceral and aural than in UNREAL One of the midline MCAs, this is the basic, all-purpose MCA for the player who isn't picky. If you want a mecha that does everything well without any of the tradeoffs that come with doing one thing extremely well, this is the one for you. Ordog The other midline MCA, but with the advantage of a faster vehicle mode than the Enforcer. The Enforcer's vehicle handles better, but the raw speed of the Ordog's vehicle rivals the Akuma's. If you want a midline MCA that can make quick getaways, get this one. Predator This is the big, hefty MCA. It's slow, but it can take more punishment than any of them. If you value raw durability over speed, you can't go wrong with this hulking menace. size as you stomp on foot soldiers more realistic, although there are and tanks in the city levels.

On foot, QUAKE is still king, but the MCAs give you great weaponry and the toughness to dish it out and take it. Monolith has taken these issues to heart and is promising a point release that will clean up the AI and make the multiplayer game more efficient. What this means is that SHOGO was slightly rushed to stores. Other than the technical issues that are being covered by the patch, I only have minor issues with the game. What we ultimately have is a game that could have gotten an Editors' Choice had it been tested thoroughly. By the time you read this, however, the patch should be out-assuming it's not vaporware (but I have some faith in Monolith). So, if you're willing to download a patch, you'll find SHOGO a shooter filled with lots of style, substance, and charm. Those without Internet connections or who just don't like patches will find a game that could have been great, but was premature in birth.

"REVIEW  KLINGON HONOR GUARD Way of the Warrior Joining the Klingons Isn't Quite the Honor It Should Be training, it's your job to hunt down the ringleaders of the plot for your Honor Guard mentors. it sounds like the perfect setup for a stellar first-person shooter full of gore, Klingon expletives, some sparsely populated bars and clubs, an Andorian space station, a polished Andorian tradeship, a crimson-hued Klingon cruiser, and the ruined moon of Praxis. The level design on the later levels is by Elliott Chin lingons and 3D shooters are a match made in Skorvakor, right? After all, who can argue with a 3D shooter based on the violent Klingons? The best of the breed are the Klingon Honor Guards, highly trained and tasked with the protection of the Klingon High Council, but recently, treachery has entered the ranks of these once incorruptible warriors. With the Klingon High Council all but destroyed by an assassin's bomb, the Honor Guard has sworn a blood oath to exact swift vengeance on the masterminds of this traitorous plot. As the epitome of Honor Guard were confusing. I lost lots of time trying to figure out what to do on the space station level since there was no indication that I could walk off the path of the outer hull and scale the steep walls of the station to a rooftop elevator. Many times, because the computers or download terminals all looked the same from room to room, I had no ideal was in the mission objective room until the mission-ending screen popped up.

"Basic Weapons Training ALCATULON DAGGER DON'T GO INTO THE LIGHT The particle dispersal cannon is the BFG of KLINGON HONOR GUARD, and it's strong enough to scare off our friendly neighborhood Ro'Ped. BAT LETH The dagger and Bat'leth fly in an arc. Remember this when using them as throwing weapons. Aim high and only throw at medium range to short range. DISRUPTOR RIFLE be much variation in military dress. but it would have been nice if they had ultra-elite guards or fantastic alien monsters. The Nausicaans (bothersome weaklings) and Lethians (impressive, ethereal attackers) do spice up the action. Another disappointment is the lack of large, menacing beastsaside from the gargantuan Ro'PeD. This rock-hurling brute is imposing, but he only appears on Rura Penthe. Nothing quite his size or demeanor appears for the rest of the game. The other nonhumanoid creatures are the guard beast, the Targ, and the Tar Chop. What are they? A white dog, a Klingon pig, and a scorpion. Yawn. In fairness, the water creatures are very nice-quick, sleek barracudalike monsters with rows of teeth and a tendency to attack in packs. Enemy Al isn't that great. Some enemies just stand still, and I had to push them before they would attack. There are some winners and some losers in KLINGON's formida ble arsenal. The disruptor pistol and rifle are serviceable, but look utterly uninspired-an unfortunate by-product of MicroProse's obligation to faithfully represent Star Trek weaponry. I switched to the assault disruptor as soon as I acquired it and kept using it for most of the game. Its secondary fire mode disintegrates opponents. turning them into red ashes. The ding pach spits a spinning disc that chews apart its target before returning to the gun. Very nice. Strangely, the Sith har blaster, a late game weapon, was effective at taking out Klingons with one shot but couldn't even dent certain tar chops. The final weapon is a BFG-like cannon that can also create a mini black hole as its secondary attack. Two melee weapons round out your arsenal and are among the cooler weapons in KLINGON. look good, but get close to them and you'll find they aren't anywhere near as detailed as the beautiful creatures in UNREAL. MicroProse says it opted for this lower texture detail to boost frame-rate. For the most part the game runs along at a nice clip, but in some areas the game would chug along before coming back to full speed. This was on a Pentium Il 400 with 64MB of RAM. Some of KLINGON's special effects are very nice, most notably the transparent Lethians and their translucent balls of blue energy. Similarly striking is the shimmering energy in the various warp cores and clear tubes throughout the levels. Nearly as impressive are the death scenes for zero-G kills-zap an enemy and he'll float away, bubbles of blood spinning around him. However, the explosions aren't spectacular and the blood is too blurry. The detail on objects also suffers greatly at extreme close-ups. I encountered some clipping problems, the most egregious being a dead Klingon that spun backward and became halfway lodged into a wall. Multiplay isn't as fast as in QUAKE II, but level design for the multiplayer levels is pretty good and the frame-rates aren't too bad. Still, before rushing into KLINGON deathmatch, remember that KLINGON uses the UNREAL engine, so look for the latest patch. MicroProse was onto something with KLINGON HONOR GUARD, and the end result is a fairly good game with a split personality. The great premise starts out slowly but improves the longer you play. Some weapons and monsters aren't too hot, others are pretty cool. The problem is that it could have been much better. Still, if Star Trek and shooter fans can forgive the game's plodding start and keyhunting mission design, KLINGON HONOR GUARD could provide a rewarding, if uneven, experience. CGW GRENADE LAUNCHER The disruptor rifle, assault disruptor, and grenade launcher all require reloading each time you switch between primary and secondary fire modes. Even when you return to a weapon after putting it away, it won't default to primary firing mode but rather will remain at the setting you left it in. ASSAULT DISRUPTOR The assault disruptor is a powerful weapon, but has a short range. Its more powerful secondary attack has an even shorter range. For long-range sniping, use the secondary attack of the disruptor rifle or the rocket launcher (shown below). ROCKET LAUNCHER Engine Ups and Downs The graphics, like everything else in this game, are a mixed bag. Beginning levels are boring and monotonous, but the later levels-from Rura Penthe to the Andorian ship to the Klingon cruisers--are much more impressive. Most enemies DIE WITH HONOR This curved blade is the Bat'leth, a vicious melee weapon that can also be thrown. Two undocumented powerups you'll find are the blood wine and bowl of gagh. Blood wine increases your attack damage, and gagh gives you 100 bonus health. Elliott Chin has read almost every Star Trek book published, but still likes classic Trek the best. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 317 "


"REVIEW. TRESPASSER Veloci-Craptor TRESPASSER Is Knee-deep in Something and It Sure Isn't Fun by Robert Coffey s bad as genetically reengineering dinosaurs turned out to be in Jurassic Park movies, TRESPASSER definitely tops them in the \"good idea gone horribly wrong\" department. A first-person shooter that desperately wants to be an adventure game, TRESPASSER is an ugly mishmash of uncertain identity, crippled by ill-conceived ideas, a technically promising engine that screws up gameplay, and more horrendous glitches than 10,000 men could shake 10,000 sticks at. NICE RAPTOR, PRETTY RAPTOR With obliging dinos that occasionally freeze in their tracks TRESPASSER is a better prehistoric petting zoo than it is a game. Be Scared, Be Very A-scared The game's premise is simple. You, as a young woman named Anne, find yourself stranded on a COMPUTER dinosaur-infested island and quite reasonably decide you'd be better off back home. You explore the island, searching through the rubble for a phone, a radio, anything to contact the outside world. Gamers expecting a first-person shooter with T-Rex's and Raptors providing the targets will be the first (but definitely not the last) to be disappointed, since TRESPASSER is no run-and-gun shooter. Instead, it tries really hard to be an adventure game, emphasizing puzzle solving and exploration. It's not that either. So what is it? It's thuddingly dull and totally frustrating, that's what. Operating under the misguided notion that an actionpacked, thrilling shooter was some thing to be avoided, Dreamworks barely sprinkles dinosaurs across the gaming landscape, keeping your weapon supply woefully low so that often the best course of action is to avoid action. Doesn't that sound like fun? This wouldn't be so bad if TRESPASSER lived up to its selfdeluding high ideals and served up loads of challenging puzzles in a rich and fascinating environment that rewarded exploration, but it doesn't some levels are puzzlefree. Most of the puzzles involve stacking boxes into impromptu staircases so you can reach higher areas. When a new puzzle does crop up-like lobbing stones to make a teetering plank create an accessible ramp-expect to do it at least three times in a row. leaps. You die frequently, but there's no quicksave or quick-load option. Level transitions are seamless, but you lose all your weapons when a new level loads. Dinosaurs may inexplicably freeze and not respond. With more problems too numerous to list, the brevity of the game is most noteworthy. Not because it's the most egregious gaffe, but because its mere eight levels GAMING WORLD * AWWA MAW APPEAL: Gamers who value tedium and frustration over gameplay and fun. PROS: Physicsbased engine isn't too shabby; it's mercifully short. CONS: Game engine complicates play, ridiculously high system requirements yet is still sluggish; convoluted controls, graphic glitches, simplistic puzzles/key hunts. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166. Windows 95/98, 32MB RAM, 120MB hard-drive space, 4x CD-ROM, 1MB video card; supports Windows-compatible sound card 3D SUPPORT: Most Direct3D cards. MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: None. Price: $49.95 Publisher: Electronic Arts Redwood City, CA (650) 628-1900 thus ensuring a quick death by dino. And while the physics-based engine is commendable in creating an environment full of objects to be pushed and picked up (but not destroyed), it makes dealing with those endless box staircases a repetitive grind-boxes fall every time you breathe on them. The engine is also slow. Movement is never fast, but once a few objects or creatures start filling up the screen, man alive, does the frame rate tank. And this is on a Pentium II 300 with 3D acceleration and scads of RAM—who knows what it'd be like on the game's alleged minimum system (a Pentium 166). This slowness is especially aggravating when you're traversing a huge enclosure, futilely searching for a white keycard. The list of bad design elements and botched technology goes on and on. Collision detection is a joke, letting your character get snagged on walls and in bridges, and letting dinosaurs get tangled in fences until they die. Since you can only store one item on your body, you must always carry a gun in your hand, further bogging down the frame-rate. Your character can lift crates with one hand but can't make simple jumps and HEAD IN THE SAND Bottom of the barrel collision detection will stick you to walls and dump this dead dinosaur underground. Engine Trouble Solving the same puzzle repeatedly is bad enough, but it's even more maddening thanks to the game's engine and interface. A tangle of keyboard commands lets you raise and lower your arm as well as bend and turn your wrist. All these options do is make aiming that occasional gun less precise, ensure that anyone unfortunate enough to play TRESPASSER can make the hurting stop sooner than most games. CGW Robert Coffey has actually dreamed about playing TRESPASSER. He's not sleeping much. www.ea.com 318 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"Miss-less Missiles SIMULATLONISPACE Ithough the missiles in these games were toned down in the first patch, they still home in with all the tenacity of a six-year-old girl after a Beanie Baby. If you thought the student loan agency was bad, try the business end of Novalogic's AMRAAMs. The patch, which is downloaded automatically when you connect to NovaWorld, will also make your life a little easier by adding a red line to the Attack Display. This line connects the missile to your location in the center of the display. Zoom in the display and you'll get a clear picture of an incoming missile's distance and bearing. The best defense against these pests is several thousand tons of God's good eartha mountain. When a missile is launched at you, try to duck behind the nearest mountain or dive into a canyon. But since there's no way to determine the missile's relative altitude, this can be tricky; a launch from on-high may clear any obstacles. The next best defense against missiles is speed. Put the missile at a right angle to your aircraft, kick in the afterburners, and dive. If you have time to build up enough speed, the missile will sail right by even if you're out of countermeasures. Forget the conventional wisdom of pulling a highG turn at the last minute. In these games this will just slow you down and make you easier to hit. This \"fun with physics\" wouldn't be as hard to swallow if it weren't for Novalogic's continued insistence that its games are realistic sims. Note the first bulleted point on each box's feature list: \"Authentic Lockheed Martin GLASS COCOON Reflective canopies in Approved Flight padlock mode help you keep up with your Model and Avionics\" plane's orientation. and \"Authentic Form heavily loaded aircraft.

"REVIEW  F-16 MULTIROLE FIGHTER/MIG-29 FULCRUM STIMULATIONS ability to fly blithely past missiles. The most significant challenge in these games is trying to stay out of the firing range of enemy planes and SAMs; once a missile is launched, the fun is quickly sucked out of the game. Missiles operate by some kind of alternate-reality physics, in that they seem to decide they're going to hit you 75 percent of the time no matter what you do (see sidebar, previous page). Short of a realistic flight model and a 300-page manual, can't imagine a quicker way to turn off casual gamers than to send them down in flames every time a missile targets them. The games ship with a roughhewn mission builder to extend their single-player life beyond the roughly 100 missions. But Nova logic's Fixed Wing Mission Editor is more complicated than the mission builders in complex sims such as JANE'S F-15 and HORNET: KOREA. From the confusing treatment of vehicles and their waypoints as separate objects to the lack of graphical feedback on the map, it's obvious it hasn't been honed for ease of use. You'll find far less flexibility than in more user-friendly mission builders. And the documentation isn't much help. deeper gameplay. RAW divides players into two sides and allows pilots to choose a fighter or bomber loadout. Unfortunately, these hard-coded configura tions exclude some of the more interesting air-toground toys.

There's no doubt that new pilots will flock in droves to Novalogic's simplicity, but they'll have little frame of reference to know what they're missing. These games' repetitive gameplay, frustrating combat, wasted detail, and disregard for their subject matter do not make for a good introduction to the world of flight sims. Instead, FIGHTERS ANTHOLOGY and ISRAELI AIR FORCE would have offered new pilots ample variety: JOINT STRIKE FIGHTERS does an excellent job of making the details of jet combat accessible to beginners; there's gratifying and simple combat in RED BARON II; and TEAM APACHE is a great example of an easy sim with an obvious affection for its subject. But the developers at Novalogic don't seem to have a proper appreciation for the mechanics, the machinery, or the miracle of flight. In fact, this is hardly flight. This is a hollow pageant with airplanes—as thin on substance as the air itself. Novalogic's bundle is like biting into a pretty cake and getting a mouthful of icing: sugary, insubstantial, and terribly unsatisfying. CGW Tom Chick blames flight sims for dragging him into a life of computer gaming. His latest addictions are RED BARON 3D, JANE'S F-15, and anything with a Messerchmitt.

"REVIEW. COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR SIIMUTANTE:14 World War Toolkit Impressive in Its Own Right, Unsurpassed Expansion Potential Makes This Sim Shine kan Erol by Denny Atkin fter a long drought with no new WWII flight sims, Microsoft's COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR (CFS) is the first drop in the upcoming deluge of prop simulations. Not only is it the first to hit the shelves, it's likely to be the last to head to the bargain bin. The game is not only a superb simulation of what it's like to fly a WWII fighter, it also features unparalleled expansion capabilities. Buy it now as a WWII Europe sim and you'll probably be able to play it later as a Pacific, North Africa, Russian Front, or even Korean sim. The key to this flexibility comes from the fact that CFS is an evolution of the engine used in FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 (FS98). However, CFS completely random mix of opponents at you. The Training Missions introduce you to basic flight and air combat through AVI demonstrations and an interactive instructor. These are nicely done but would have been even more useful had the instructor demonstrated each maneuver once before turning over the controls. Many of the 25 missions in Single Mission mode have a 60s WWII action film feel. While some are historically accurate, others involve tasks such as destroying a staff car parked under the Eiffel Tower, killing a French resistance spy as he escapes in a speedboat, or shooting down a Hurricane over London as it performs an air show for Churchill. Finally, there's the cream of the simulation-Campaign mode. There are two campaigns, the Battle of Britain and the Battle for Europe, each of which can be flown from either the Allied or Axis perspective. The 72 campaign missions are historical in nature and do an excellent job of conveying the changes in the air war from 1940 to 1945. In the Battle of Britain missions, allies are primarily flying KILL AND BE KILLED This P-47 is about to fall victim to your FW190's guns. But the flames coming from your nose indicate you have problems of your own. COMPUTER GAMING **** has little resemblance to its pacifist predecessor. Along with the requisite guns, damage model, and AI, Microsoft has pumped up the engine with a dramatically faster frame-rate, top-notch terrain graphics, working instruments in virtual cockpit view, and a host of other improvements. The result is a program that-with a couple of notable exceptions-feels like a whole new sim. Admiring the Scenery CFS includes five modes of play and multiplayer. Free Flight lets you take to the skies without fearing attack-think FS98 in much cooler planes. A full-featured Quick Combat mode lets you face wave after wave of various enemy planes over an airfield of your choice. You can select specific types of enemy craft to face, such as Axis Fighters, or let the computer toss a WORL Multiplayer: So Much Potential... APPEAL: WWII air combat fans; Combat Flight Simulator FLIGHT SIM 98 pilots tired of playing nice. PROS: Amazing expandability: excellent mission design; top-notch flight modeling. CONS: No exterior plane damage: no wingman commands, shallow multiplayer support. DIFFICULTY: Moderate. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 133, Windows 95/98 or NT4/SP3, 16MB RAM (32 recommended), 230MB hard drive space, 2x CD-ROM, SVGA graphics. 3D SUPPORT: Direct3D. MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: Modem, direct cable, IPX or TCP/IP LAN (2-255 players), MSN Gaming Zone (2-8 players): 1 CD per player Price: $54.95 Publisher: Microsoft Redmond, WA (800) 426-9400 OMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR's multiplayer mode is frustrating because it's almost very good. We played a number of aerial deathmatches with smooth performance and little warping. In addition to LAN and TCP/IP support, you'll also be able to find other players on the MSN Gaming Zone. What's there in multiplayer mode works well. The problem is what's not there. You can't fly any of the sim's built-in missions with other players. You're limited to free-for-all and team deathmatches, which eventually become boring, Worse even these modes aren't fully realized. With melees all starting at about 2,000 feet, combat almost always ends up as turning fights on the deck. In addition, while you can disable unlimited ammo (which we quickly did here at the CGW offices since the QUAKE Il crowd was spraying .50 caliber bullets as though from a fire hose), once you run out of ammunition you can't land and reload. Your only alternative is to crash into the ground, giving a kill credit to the last person to get a bullet into you. This game desperately needs the ability to repair and reload upon landing at an airfield. It's a shame that multiplayer isn't more thoroughly implemented because the ability to set up dogfights like Sabres vs. Sopwiths is a sim pilot's dream. www.microsoft.com/games 330 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"SIMULATION SPACE STUKA AT 10 O'CLOCK! The virtual cockpit and padlock views are much improved from the version we previewed; both feature working instruments. defense for various British cities and factories. By the time you reach the latter Battle over Europe missions, you'll be flying long-range, high-altitude escort missions for bombers attacking Germany. In general, the missions are his torically accurate (save perhaps the appearance of Stukas during the Normandy invasion) and include random enemy waypoints, which keep them from being predictable during replay. Nicely done battle chatter helps add to the atmosphere, but the lack of wingman commands (especially \"help me!\") sometimes makes you feel as though you're tagging along with the mission rather than being an integral part. I appreciate not having to refly missions over and over until success-after all, in real life many combat missions fail. But perhaps the designers should have at least required you to survive to move on. There are incentives in the form of medals and promotions-for successfully completing missions. Campaign missions are always flown from takeoff, but an optional \"time jump\" key lets you advance to the next waypoint if you want to jump right into the action. You can also accelerate time; but with no autopilot, it can be tricky to handle planes at 4x speed.

All of the usual 3D special effects, such as sun glare, unsurpassed cloud depictions, transparency, and image smoothing are here, with surprisingly fast frame-rates. Even a relatively modest machine, such as a Pentium 166 with 64MB of RAM and an original Voodoo card, has no trouble handling the video demands due to the lightly detailed landscapes. The entire United States, Western Europe, and a few cities in Canada are included in the terrain modeling using U.S. Geological Survey data to model elevation. Most of this terrain is pretty generic, with predominantly green landscapes: 35 major cities receive relatively \"highdetail\" environments. But \"highdetail\" is in the eye of the beholder. Most major landmarks are here; famous buildings, statues, and stadiums are easily recognized. But overall, there aren't many structures in these areas.

You're not going to GAMING **** WORLD locate the neighborhood gas station in any city in this sim.

There's no doubt that flight instruction is the strongest point of PRO PILOT '99. There's no other program that even comes close to delivering the detailed information available here. It begins with the excellent Flight Companion Manual, a good overview of the basic components of general aviation. With chapters on basic maneuvers, aircraft, navigation, and much more, this book is an easily understood asset to the beginning student pilot. Next, the animated video tutorials of the 31 Ground Lessons (also carried over from the previous version) systematically take you through the various tasks required in flight training. Averaging about two minutes each, this hour's worth of information is time well spent and is interesting to boot. After this \"ground training,\" you'll be ready for the new tutorial flights. The National Association of Flight Instructors worked with Dynamix to develop 48 step-bystep \"flying lessons\" that take you through maneuvers and procedures in the various aircraft. Lessons are selected from a new pop-up Pilot's Operating Handbook that can be moved TWILIGHT ZONE This King Air is over Topeka, Kansas, at about 2,000 feet on approach to Billard Airport. Alas, if you live outside the 35 areas modeled in detail, this is what downtown will look like. 332 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JANUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"SIMULATION SPACE around the screen. The text-based tutorial can be scrolled as you fly the mission. This displays all necessary keyboard commands-a really nice touch. Aircraft instrument panels and controls are precisely represented, and the equipment is easily operated with the mouse or the keyboard. The lessons increase in complexity as you move on to more sophisticated aircraft. You can even create your own tutorials and share them with others. Once you've mastered the basics, the improved Flight Plan Wizard gives you the opportunity to generate some realistic crosscountry flights that will hone your basic flying, navigation, and instrument procedures. The Wizard has a simple, effective interface that gets you in the air quickly. Informative. accurate, and easy to use, the ground instruction and procedural pilot training aspects of PRO PILOT '99 are absolutely unequaled in a computer program selling for less than $50. recorded from the actual specific aircraft you're flying. These sounds are almost perfect from the engine cough on start-up to the sound of the gear coming down. An audio air traffic control system provides weather, clearances, and other flight information that's pretty realistic. This should make student pilots much more comfortable upon their entry into today's crowded skies. If you fly a filed flight plan, air traffic control will give you clearance to each waypoint along the route. If you are flying without a filed flight plan, you'll receive air traffic control instructions near airport areas. You can select a talking copilot to handle the radio calls, greatly simplifying approach procedures. The air traffic control Al is much improved as well-you'll no longer receive repetitive instructions to do something you've already accomplished, like to climb to a certain altitude. THE FUTURE IS CLOUDY No other sim can match the cloud quality in PRO PILOT '99. The shapes, translucency, and subtle blurring of the rivet heads as the clouds sweep over the wing are unequaled. Flight Modeling Made Easy While the ground and procedures training features lead the pack with regard to other flight simulations, the flight model trails the herd. Available aircraft include two models of the Cessna 172 trainer, three Beechcraft (the Baron, Bonanza, and King Air), and a Cessna Citation biziet. There are well-documented performance data available for all these aircraft, and, in general, the aircraft meet those parameters fairly well. Control response can be easily tweaked in the menu to give the proper \"feel\" to each aircraft. The problem is in the general flight modeling, which lacks the refinement that the focus-on-flight training requires. While drag effects have been improved, and pitch power relationships are better than in the previous release, some old problems remain. There's no torque effect to create yaw when you fire. wall the throttle for takeoff; you won't need to use your rudders in these aircraft. When practicing slow flight in a single-engine craft (where your rudder is less effective because of slow speed), you can also firewall the power without any resultant yaw. Fail an engine at max power on a twin-prop and there's an incredibly gentle drift into the dead engine. Stalls are amazingly mild with any pitch or power setting, and there's no way to get these aircraft to spin. Generally speaking, this is all \"negative training\"; students are led to believe that they can leave their feet on the floor in a prop and that a 50-degree nosehigh/turning full-stall at takeoff power is easily recovered. It's one thing to encourage people to fly with a good instruction program. It's quite another to make them think flying is a simple, forgiving pursuit based on a simplistic flight model. Graveyards are full of people that failed to give aviation its due respect. This program begs for a realistic flight model in addition to the present overly simplified version. It can be done; there are several air-combat sims available with fairly realistic flight models. Given the focus of PRO PILOT '99, this needs to be done. Buy Now, Save Later PRO PILOT '99 should have been the first release of PRO PILOT. Unlike its predecessor, it's a usable, finished product that sets new standards for inexpensive computer flight instruction. In this area, there is no equal at anywhere near its price. In almost all other respects, however, this is an average, three-star civilian flight simulation. The outstanding, comprehensive flight instruction earns the extra half star. CGW On the Bright Side A few other aspects of this sim deserve special mention.

"REVIEW  MORPHEUS Pleasant Dreams ADVENTUREZRPG MORPHEUS Isn't Great, but It's a Welcome Diversion by Scorpia or those not already aware, Morpheus was the god of dreams. So, you would expect dreams to play an important role in Piranha's MORPHEUS, and in fact they are the focal point of the game. This adventure drama opens in 1952, with our protagonist, Matthew Holmes, searching the Arctic for his father, Theodore, who vanished from there 25 years earlier. What Matthew actually finds is the fabled ship Herculania, whose remaining passengers lie locked in eternal nightmares. They don't just dream, either. As you explore the vessel, ghostly scenes are replayed in certain locations. They can be a fleeting glimpse of someone slipping through a doorway or extended conversations among two or more passengers. It's hard not to think of this game as being subtitled \"MYST Meets 7TH GUEST on the STARSHIP TITANIC.\" Like those three games, the setting of MORPHEUS is basically deserted. Aside from the phantom flashbacks, you meet no people during your time onboard the ship. The story of what happened is pieced together from various sources: diaries, notes, kinescopes, recordings, and, of course, the re-enactments.

In fact, you can't carry more than one object at a time. That said, this is an adventure game, and there are definitely puzzles to solve. The difference is that you must be extremely observant, take good notes, and use deductive reasoning in a number of situations. Aside from the relatively minor chores of getting into the ship and restoring full power, the bulk of the game consists of figuring out the private codes to the passenger staterooms and entering the four dreamworlds, which have their own sets of puzzles to figure out. Many of the puzzles CLAIRE MOON Without giving too much away, we'll just say that are not difficult, prothis lovely lady is what the game is all about. vided you've been thorough in your explorations and have taken good notes.

"DREAMING IN COLOR If you're interested in the god of dreams, Morpheus is the central character in Neil Gaiman's Sandman series of graphic novels, which has nothing to do with the MORPHEUS game but offers some of the best fantasy available in any medium. After nearly a decade, the series is no longer published. But all of the more than seven dozen Sandman tales are widely available in collected editions. The following are some suggestions on where to start. Keep in mind that these \"comics\" are serious art, intended for adults; don't buy these for your 10-year-old niece. ADVENTUREZRPG No Nightmare to Play The interface is simple. The cursor is a pointing arrow for directions, with which you can move; a magnifying glass for close-ups; a hand with forefinger extended for manipulation; and a ship's wheel which indicates when you can turn in place for a full view of your surroundings. A button at the bottom of the screen takes you to the control panel. At the panel, you can save, restore, and quit, and also make adjustments to the sound volume and some graphic elements. Saving is done in the old-fashioned way, in which you specify a regular file name in DOS-convention format (e.g., morpheus.sav). Unfortunately, you can't be too descriptive with only eight characters. But you can save to any directory you wish and thus have as many save positions as you would ever need. Graphically, MORPHEUS is gorgeous. On the ship in the dreamworlds everything is beautifully rendered. Even the ghostly replays look good. For all that you don't need a high-powered machine; the game ran just fine on a Pentium 166. In fact, it ran perfectly throughout with only one technical problem. This is a known bug that occurs in the PC version (there is also a Mac version of the game) in the bazaar. If you touch the drum there, the game will crash. Piranha has a patch for this on its Web site (www.piranhainteractive. com). You can also avoid the crash by simply not touching the drum; it isn't necessary for solving any of the puzzles. While the game has no notable game-design flaws, there are some minor drawbacks. For one thing, you can only boot the game off the initial CD, instead of any of the three. This means shuffling disks every time you want to play since most of the game files are on the second and third CDs. Part of the game is learning what happened to the passengers, but you can do this by simply viewing the four kinescopes. That tells you 90 percent of the story at the start. Anyone can fill in the remaining blanks. Also, the characters are unpleasant people. I'd have felt better about \"saving\" them if they'd been a bit less harsh. The most annoying part is the end, which is ambiguous and Dream Country This isn't the first Sandman, but it's where Gaiman really hits his stride. Learn about imprisoned muses, view the dreams of cats, and hang out with Will Shakespeare. NOMAN A Game of You More bizarre, yet likable, characters than you'll ever meet this side of a Lewis Carroll novel, featuring a blonde heroine named Barbie, a female rock star (who just wants to settle down), a chillingly practical witch, and a weird villain, the Cuckoo, who AN attacks victims in their dreams. syur The Doll's House This can either be read as a fairly straightforward story about serial killers or as a parable on what to do when you make the wrong choices in life--it's enlightening, uplifting...and creepy as hell.

Wilson etrayal, carnage, and sorcery abound in Monolith's RAGE OF MAGES, a missionbased role-playing game with real-time combat. The 3D terrain affects line-of-sight and impacts travel. The spell effects are delightful. The story makes sense in an epic way. Natural catastrophe has set off a cycle of endless war. And your hero must travel through a magical portal to the mysterious island (or alloid in the Russian version) of Uimoir to recover the artifact, which will stop the suffering.

"REVIEW  GRAND PRIX LEGENDS SPAU Blast From the Past Papyrus Takes Racing Simulations to New Heights of Realism, Difficulty by Gordon Goble apyrus Design Group has a history of developing games targeted squarely at those who will accept only the most realistic PC racing available. The fact that titles such as NASCAR RACING and INDYCAR RACING—with their hypercomplex car models, realistic tracks, and sophisticated garages-have met with huge critical and commercial success proves that there really is an audience for the serious racing simulation. Recently Papyrus has relented somewhat on the strict authenticity of its products, adding \"arcade\" features, numerous driver aids, and an omniscient crew chief/spotter to the latest NASCAR. Is this a sign of things to come? Not bloody likely. I MEANT TO DO THIS Handling the cars in GRAND PRIX LEGENDS is going to take every ounce of talent that you have. Plan on spending a lot of time sideways or on fire. COMPUTER GAMING GRAND PRIX LEGENDS (GPL) is the latest in the Papyrus/Sierra racing collection, and it is anything but dumbed down. Instead, it will in all likelihood elicit one very serious question from even the staunchest of the Papyrus faithful: Has this realism thing perhaps been taken a bit too far? WORLD ***** APPEAL: Serious Pomp y racers craving FRANTABRIK realism; historical racing buffs. PROS: Authentic physics modeling: excellent Al; big M time crashes and 52 outstanding replays; ultradetailed cars. CONS: Car dynamics may be perplexing for many possible frame-rate problems; collision detection questions. DIFFICULTY: Advanced. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166, Windows 95/98 with DirectX5 or later, 32MB RAM, 59MB hard-drive space, 2x CD-ROM, 2MB DirectX-compatible SVGA video card. 3D SUPPORT: 3Dfx or Rendition. MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: Internet, LAN (2-20 players), modem (2 players). serial (2 players); 1 CD per player. Price: $49.95 Publisher: Sierra Sports Eugene, OR (800) 757-7707 Glory Days Now, make no mistake about it, GPL may well be Papyrus' finest hour. Dave Kaemmer, Matt Sentell, and the usual suspects at Papyrus have fashioned the most astonishing physics model ever to grace a racing game. They've coupled it with heretofore unseen levels of artificial intelligence, intricate graphics, typically bloodcurdling Papyrus crash effects, and a compelling sense of history that focuses on one highly interesting era: 1960s Grand Prix racing. But at the same time, GPL is so rigorous that even the most skilled sim driver may well find himself several hours into the game before he's managed to turn his first suc cessful hot lap, never mind getting moderately competitive.

The game does come with a thorough strategy book, but it stops short of spelling anything out for you. Coca-Cola track adhesion of period cars (Lotus-Fords, Ferraris, and the like), which were far too fast for the stick their bodies and tires could provide. There's no mistaking that the power is applied through the rear wheels, and there's also no mistake that Papyrus has removed virtually every safety net. Sure, braking and throttle assistance and automatic transmissions are available, but even with these aids drivers are constantly on edge from green flag to checkered flag. And don't be thinking you'll have some magical on-screen HUD to convey pertinent information. Back then, everything was manual, with the simplest of cockpit instrument panels and no pit communication whatsoever. So it is in the game. Heck, I still find myself going back to the \"arcade\" rear chase view over and over again, despite knowing that the truly fast times will eventually come through the in-car perspective. I certainly can't perceive subtle in-car sensations quite as well from back there, but it does give me a better grasp of space restrictions, momentum, velocity, and skid intensity—important aspects to consider when you can't confidently regulate the advanced GPL car model. But those who do manage to come to grips, so to speak, with the complexity of the physics will find their job far from complete. You see, no matter how good you get behind the wheel, it's going to take some extensive mechanical tinkering just to get past midpack, much more so than any other Papyrus product to date. For that of course, there's the GPL garage, a facility that allows you to tweak virtually every tweakable aspect of these vintage cars. Yet having the necessary tools and knowing how to use them are two completely separate issues. Unlike previous Papyrus titles, the GPL garage does not stock any \"Fast\" or \"Ace\" setups and is brain-numbingly involved, featuring a number of esoteric modifications whose combined effects can be fully understood only through time, experience, and lots of AIRBORNE! One of the upsides of racing a car that you can barely control is that you'll spend a lot of time doing things you never would survive in real life like flying, for example, and a panoramic perspective from side to side-a great idea for a driving sim. And in quintessential Papyrus style, multipositional replays are both TV-quality and a great learning aid. Saving Grace GPL features some of the finest artificially intelligent drivers ever plunked in a racing game. I mean, these guys are smart-bobbing and weaving and showing off their collision avoidance time and again during my unimpressive initial forays. I know it's hard to believe, but they'll even veer calmly off the track and back on again should the situation be severe enough. Odd then that a completely motionless car may force an entire field to a full stop: The cars line up behind the stalled vehicle just as they did in both INDYCAR RACING games. Visually, GPL will seem a bit stark at first. Lighting effects are nonexistent and incidental trackside objects are often very 2D and appear to be no more complex than previous Papyrus games. But play the thing a bit, and you'll notice that the game developers have funneled their artistic talents into the things that really matter. Other critical perks include amazingly intricate cars that are solid and perspectively correct from any angle, suspension that jitters and jumps at all four corners of the car, varying degrees and shades of gritty engine and tire smoke to suit each circumstance, and a lovely assortment of sound effects. Most notably though, GPL is widescreen with black bars across the top and bottom of the screen game just isn't set up to handle crashes at a combined speed in excess of 350 mph. The frame-rates, meanwhile, seemed just fine under normal racing conditions but far less so should mangled cars and smoke fill the screen. Fortunately, Papyrus has included an absolutely enormous graphic options menu. Time to Die If you enjoy a little slice-'n-dice with your wheel-to-wheel action, Papyrus hasn't forgotten about you either. These cars blow apart into a shower of strewn chunks that acrobatically flip through the air It's an all-too-real ode to the danger of mid-'60s Grand Prix racing, but one that's muted slightly by collisions that should have happened but didn't. You see, sometimes cars can contact without any noticeable result. In fact, I've watched several replays where the wheels of one car have merged through wheels of another like they weren't even there. Of course, I was backtracking at the time hoping for yet another episode of horrific carnage, and maybe the Hard Sell Papyrus is to be praised for its commitment to authenticity and the know-how and creativity involved in concocting yet another landmark simulation. However, many will find GRAND PRIX LEGENDS to be almost too realistically tough and will give up before the game's many joys can be uncovered. It's a great game, but the question to ask yourself is: Do you have the talent and patience to handle it?

"REVIEW  NEED FOR SPEED III: HOT PURSUIT CAMING EDITORS CHOICE US PORTES Speed Freak Beautiful, Realistic, and Intense, NFS III Takes Arcade Racing to the Limit by Kenneth Johnson EED FOR SPEED III: HOT PURSUIT (NFS III) is the latest addition to Electronic Arts' longrunning series of driving games, and it takes the series' reputation for excellence to new heights. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous-perhaps the finest I've seen in a racing game to date. The texture maps used on the cars accurately reflect the surrounding environs. Reflections of trees, buildings, other cars, and tunnel lights flicker across the surface of your car. The effect is really intense at night and in Hot Pursuit mode-flashing blue and red police lights adding to the tension of the chase. EL DIABLO Y LA POLICA If your vice is the desire to speed past the cops in a Lamborghini, NEED FOR SPEED III can help you legally fulfill it. But, fortunately, NEED FOR SPEED III is a lot more than just pretty graphics. and dangerous. If your speed drops below 55 mph and a patrol car is close enough, you're stopped and either sternly warned or, after repeated violations, arrested and taken off the street. The complete rush of being involved in a high-speed pursuit is certainly one of the most compelling aspects of the game. COMPUTER police interceptors. The small town cops of Hometown talk and drive like they're straight out of Hazzard County. On the Red Rock Ridge track you'll encounter rangerlike officers driving soupedup utility vehicles. The Al here is the most advanced I've seen. The police set up roadblocks with tire spikes and use realistic tactics, such as trying to box you in and slow you down. They are also not beyond running you off the road-since after all, you're probably armed GAMING WORLD Circuit City The game comes with four basic tracks each with its own distinct challenges and ambiance.

MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: Modem or serial connection (2 players), LAN (2-8 players). Drive-by NFS III provides several singleplayer modes and supports multiplayer action over a local network. The most basic mode lets you drive a single race against a single car or a full grid on any of the unlocked tracks. Tournament mode pits you against a full grid of other highpriced road racers across a series of tracks. Knockout mode is similar except that the car placing last is eliminated at the end of each race-until it's just you and one other driver The full-featured multiplayer mode can make for some seriously competitive white-knuckle driving sessions. Playing against the Al is okay for getting familiar with the tracks and unlocking the secrets, but the gameplay really takes off when you go up against other real drivers. Hot Pursuit mode is where you get to see whether you've got what it takes to run from the cops-or to chase down speeders if you prefer to play the long arm of the law.

"REVIEW  NEED FOR SPEED III: HOT PURSUIT SPORITIES a good force-feedback wheel. Using a force-feedback wheel lets you really feel the road. When the road surface changes—when you drive over a cobbled bridge, for example—the effect is extremely realistic. You also feel the vibration of the car's engine, and each car has a distinctive response. The amount of feedback for road effects, collision effects, engine vibration, and road grip can be adjusted until the balance feels right. Finish Line What distinguishes NFS III from other arcade racing gamesbesides the sheer visceral thrillsis just how realistic it feels. The combination of near-photorealistic graphics with a relatively accurate and detailed physics model really captures the experience of highspeed road racing.

Hometown track is set in farmland located in middle America and features a wicked 90-degree turn right in front of the county courthouse. Redrock Ridge is set in the painted deserts of the southwest and is a roadrunner's paradise. Atlantic offers a futuristic high-tech cityscape by the sea, while Rocky Ridge provides the classic Alpine road racing course with steep climbs and hairpin curves. If you win in Tournament mode, you unlock extended versions of these basic tracks, which leverage the experience you've gained with each track but are more challenging and expansive. (It will also unlock the Jaguar XK8 or the Mercedes SL600, depending on the difficulty setting.) The attention paid to small details is what really makes these tracks stand out. The environment is completely interactive-anything you might knock over will remain that way the next time you pass. These tracks are real 3D environments, not just pretty backdrops that flash by your car. Each one also offers secret shortcuts and cool jumps to keep things interesting. Sounds-such as barking dogs--as you scream through a Auto Shop NFS III offers a very cool selection of cars. There are offerings from Aston Martin, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Italdesign, Jaguar, and Mercedes. From the fabulous handling Ferrari 550 Maranello to the powerhouse Lamborghini Diablo SV, the entire gamut of high-priced, high-performance automobiles is well represented. Particularly interesting is the Italdesign Scighera, which is a prototype interpretation of an Alfa Romeo sports car and is not for sale. This could be the closest thing you can get to actually driving one. EA is also going to periodically provide new cars for downloading from the game's Web site (www.needforspeed. com). The first car made available at the time this review was written is the experimental Spectre R42— an English supercar with lots of power. The Lamborghini Diablo SV is the fastest car in the game and has the best acceleration. Although the curvy nature of most of the tracks makes it difficult to maintain top speed, the ability to accelerate past the pack makes it the best car to use in the singleplayer modes. In Knockout mode it is always one of the other Diablos that you will be dueling on the final Empire City track. the game's force-feedback support is excellent, and owning this game is reason enough to purchase driving in the mountains. As cruised along narrow, twisting roads, I kept thinking about how much the experience reminded me of playing NEED FOR SPEED III-at least as far as handling the car went. I wasn't being chased by the police, and I wasn't pushing my Lamborghini much past 60 mph. Okay, so I don't own a Lamborghini. But after playing this game, sure wish that I did.

"REVIEW  MADDEN 99 GAMING SPORTES Maddening No More EDITORS CHOICE EA SPORTS Finally Gets (Almost) Everything Right ROUD! by Brett Todd o close yet so far away. That simple sentence just about sums up the checkered history of the MADDEN football series on the PC. MADDEN 96 had so many problems that it never shipped. MADDEN 97 made it to the shelves but basketball-like scores caused a lot of buyers to wish that it hadn't. MADDEN 98 went out the door incomplete, and required a 10MB patch to bring both the gameplay and the graphics up to par. This year, however, it's a whole different ballgame. Just when you were ready to throw in the towel, COMPUTER EA Sports and Tiburon Entertainment have produced the Vince Lombardi (sorry, John) of football sims. And I don't use the 's' word lightly. MADDEN NFL 99 is a true simulation that brings virtually every aspect of the pro game to life. Want a pile of current and classic teams? You can pick from more than 120 provided here. Sick of the way that Jim Fassel has been running the Giants into the ground this year? Replace him and draw up your own playbook. Need TV-quality visuals? The Broncos' Bill Romanowski looks almost as mean here as he does on Monday Night Football. Up for guiding your favorite club through multiple seasons? Key up franchise mode and you too can have the pleasure of cheating the salary cap. As John Madden says in the intro: \"You want big time football? The hits, the boom, the doink, the whap? It's all here.\" M. BRUNELL GAMING ***** WORLD JAGUARS RIPPED MY FLESH Those sad sack Colts aren't much of a match for the powerful Jags this year on the computer screen or anywhere else. Oh, and accuracy fans should note that Mark Brunell does throw left-handed in MADDEN 99. She's a Beauty The gorgeous graphics are what you'll first notice about MADDEN 99. After stumbling badly last year, the designers have responded by crafting perhaps the most gorgeous visuals ever seen in a PC sports game. It's certainly the most stunning-looking football game ever. EA SPORTS boasts that each of NFL Films. Instead of the standard \"touch 'em and fall down\" approach of football games past, MADDEN 99 players haul down their opponents with textbook wrap-and-rolls. MADDEN APPEAL: PC pigskin fans who want a good mix of action, simula tion, and manage ment options. PROS: Accurate on-field action: franchise mode; gorgeous visuals and sound. CONS: A few problems with the computer interceptions and running game; Internet play too laggy. DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Intermediate, REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166 MMX with Direct3D compatible graphics accelerator card (P200 MMX without), Windows 95/98, 8x CD-ROM, DirectX6compliant sound card, 16MB RAM. 3D SUPPORT: 3Dfx, second-generation D3D-compatible cards (all major chipsets) MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: IPX-compliant network (2-8 players): modem (28.8Kbps or faster required, one CD per computer), or serial play with null modem cable (2 players): TCPAP internet connection (2-8 players).

Thanks to excellent use of 3D acceleration (Direct3D and 3Dfx modes look virtually identical, by the way), the players are almost as rounded and as lifelike as what I watched on my TV last Sunday. The little touches, such as authentic weather effects, really make this game something special. Dorsey Levens pants hard after every tough run, and you'll even see each puff of his frosty breath if it's cold enough at Lambeau Field. All the atmosphere of stadiums like Soldier Field and 3Com Park (Candlestick) is brought to life courtesy of some beautiful artwork. Uniforms are reproduced in exacting detail, right down to the last shoulder patch. Animation is equally superb. Players walk, run, juke, and dive exactly as they should. Tackles are as authentic as you'll get this side Let the Good Times Roll MADDEN 99 is much more than a pretty face. Quite frankly, this game plays more like NFL football than anything I have ever seen. Where past MADDENS leaned so far toward action that they left realistic football behind, this one successfully walks the fine line between arcade and simulation. You really have the best of both worlds. Gamepad pushers get full 10-button support for jukes, stiffarms, spins, and swim moves, along with a new one-button mode to simplify things (get the timing right and the PC handles everything else) and a directional pass method (point the D-pad BACK TO SCHOOL \"The hits, the boom, the doink, the whap\"?

Strategists can switch over to coach mode and call all the plays with a mouse. Both modes work great I've also been delighted with the intelligence of the computeroperated clubs. Whenever the PC has a chance to bury me inside the 10 with a well-angled punt, it does so. Clock management is very good. You can usually count on the computer to work the ticker with all the experience of Mike Ditka in the waning moments of the game (although you'll occasionally see some wasted time). Perhaps most impressive is the way that the Al learns from its human opponent. If I call a half-back push up the middle on first down too often, the PC makes me pay for it with a rather prescient defensive call. Same goes for pump fakes. These smarts also mean that teams generally behave as they should. Thanks to custom playbooks that mirror the real-world originals, MADDEN 99's Dallas Cowboys run out of the 'l formation a lot, the 49ers favor a wide open aerial attack, and the Redskins commit ritual suicide on the sidelines after the coin toss. Virtually all of the decisions made by the digital coach are proper ones. UP AND OVER Terrell Owens makes like Jerry Rice (or should that be Willie Mays?) with a dynamic over-theshoulder snag. effective ground assault, it's overly tough to run to the outside particularly at the higher difficulty settings. Blocks rarely materialize when you run a sweep, with the result being that even the likes of Barry Sanders has a tough time making it back to the line of scrimmage. The PC sometimes can't accomplish anything on the ground. Even the better running teams like Green Bay and Dallas have it tougher than they should. Porous defenses (that of Carolina, for example) can often completely shut down the Emmitt Smiths of the league return to the Mistake by the Lake.

"REVIEW  NCAA FOOTBALL 99 SPORT.SK College Try NCAA FOOTBALL 99 Is Better Than Last Year's Model, but It Could Still Use a Tutor by Dennis McCauley eteran sports gamers will recall EA Sports' NCAA FOOTBALL 98 as one of the few bright spots in last year's computer football debacle. Despite its throwback graphics and poor viewing angles, gamers were enamored of the NCAA's fluid player animations and authentic college football flavor. Small wonder, then, that the football crowd was expecting big things from the NCAA franchise this time around. Does the game deliver? Yes and no. The Gang's All Here The old school flavor is still there—with every Division 1-A team represented in authentic uniforms. There are also 123 different stadiums provided, although their level of detail is rather simple way to switch between cameras. If you're forced to punt, for example, and you'd prefer a perspective from the defensive side of the ball you'll have to back up to an options menu, cycle through the views, and then return to the playcalling screen.

"NCAA FOOTBALL 99. REVIEW SPORTS TOEFENSE recruit will sign on. It's an overly abstract system. Other than their position, you know nothing about the seniors-not even their names. Is it satisfying? A little. Could it be improved? Definitely. For example, if I'm recruiting 18year-old horse flesh, I want to know his size and weight and also where the kid is from. I'd like to know his SAT scores and whether he'd even consider my school before I waste precious recruiting time on him. For an example of how this is done, I'd refer the NCAA 99 design team to GTE's NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL from a couple years back. Of course GTE is out of the game business and EA Sports is kicking butt-So what do I know? However, there are some nice touches of recruiting realism. It seems harder, as it should be, to entice blue-chip prospects to downtrodden football programs such as Temple. The service academies, with their high standards and military commitment, also seem to reap a less-talented harvest. Along with recruiting, the game generates an annual report on players who have left the team-be it for the NFL draft or simply because their eligibility has expired. Returning players are rated for their improvement or lack thereof. Using this information as a guide, you can adjust your roster accordingly. WATCH OUT FOR THAT BAND NCAA FOOTBALL includes 40 historic real-life matchups, including the infamous Cal-Stanford game that took down a few marching band members in the end. without responsibility for carrying them out. Defense is particularly hairy since you have only five seconds to enter your play before the ball is snapped. Play calling involves selecting a formation and a play from a limited set of choices. Each team has a default offensive and defensive scheme. Navy, for example, offers a Wishbone. Tennessee features a pass-oriented attack even though Peyton Manning has moved on to NFL glory. Within offensive forma tions, you can choose several looks and can run a dozen plays from each. While the selection of plays is certainly enough to get you through a typical Saturday afternoon, the lack of a play editor severely limits your ability to tweak the Xs and Os. Despite these shortcomings, NCAA 99 is one hell of a lot of fun to play. Although the interface has rough edges, the game action is right on the money. In particular, the Al does some very nice things, such as having a pressured quarterback throw the ball out of the end zone rather than risk a pick. As mentioned, the player animations are excellent. Running backs duck and cut in an effort to avoid tacklers, and blitzing linebackers sometimes slam quarterbacks to the turf. Penalties, in particular, feel rightboth in timing and presentation. It's incredibly frustrating to see your left guard forget the snap count and jump out of his stance just as you were anticipating a big play. Say, can I yank his scholarship? A BUG'S LIFE NCAA FOOTBALL has a lot On the other hand, of camera angles to choose from, but the Al does some none are very good-including this strange things, too. view from way back.

CGW Good Game Once you've set your roster, play options include arcade, sim, or coach-only. Sims are lightning fast, with scores in the accurate range. An entire week's slate of games can be handled in a matter of seconds, and the game system seems to account for intangibles, such as home-field advantage. Scheduling itself is handled well. The game generates an authentic slate of opponents, including the odd Division 1-AA team. Arcade play is quite challenging, particularly since it's constricted by the camera angles. For the tactilely impaired, coach mode offers the chance to call the plays modem, or serial options for multiplayer. Perhaps EA can recruit some Net play for next year's edition.

"REVIEW  CAESAR III GAMING EDITORS Hail Caesar! CHOICE TRATEGYZWAR Friends, Romans, Countrymen—CAESAR III Is a Resounding Success! by Tim Carter ome. The very name conjures images of grandeur and might the dominator of the world, the conqueror of vast armies, and truly one of the world's greatest empires. Now, fortunately (and finally), the greatness of Rome has been reflected in a truly impressive game. Rome, if historians are to be believed, was unique in its era; and while CAESAR III probably doesn't stand alone among strat titles, it surely is one of the best, cleanest, and most fun computer games to come down the pipe in recent years. CAESAR Ill is a game of city construction and defense in ancient Rome. SIMCITY fans (and fans of CAESARSI and II) will no doubt be familiar with the basic concepts of designating land for housing, various economic and social functions, tax collection, and education (schools, libraries, and academies). Of course since land is usually at a premium, good planning is a must. Each building you construct sends out a related worker--for instance, markets send out food vendors—who services a limited \"route.\" If you structure your residential neighborhood in such a way that your medical clinics are located too far away from the housing, your physicians will be unable to reach the people, and you'll end up with a health crisis on your hands. When planning, integration and overlap are two concepts that aspiring emperors will want to get familiar with. Sold och Damascus IR of 40 2 24 of 25 THE ROAD TO SYRIA Trade is a key to success, and this map view lets you observe and manage your trade routes. and military defense. As you might expect, your city will also depend on an effective transportation grid (more on that later) and a working economic base of taxes and trade with the rest of the empire. COMPUTER space, workshops, and the like. Residential areas, on the other hand, require considerably more planning. All Roman homes must have access to roads and water, and all but the most simple homes must also have access to food. A fully functioning city will require large neighborhoods of high-value, high-density housing, which will, in turn, require health care (baths, doctors, barbers), commercial goods (furniture, oil, pottery), a variety of foods, places of religious worship (a number of different types of temples dedicated to various gods), entertainment (including venues and performers), policing, GAMING Imperial Edicts The city building core of this game is nice and well executed. What elevates CAESAR III to greatness, however, is the campaign structure within which players operate. (You can build cities just for the sake of building, but I can't see why you'd bother.) The campaign takes the form of a series of assignments, each with specific objectives set out by Rome. At each step in the campaign, you're given the choice between a dangerous city site and an economically challenging one. Even if you repeatedly select the same WORLD Rome Zones Cities in CAESAR III revolve around the concept of neighborhoods. In each neighborhood, you must allocate space for the area's primary function (for instance, housing) as well as various related buildings. For the most part, the game makes the process of building a working industrial area quite straightforward, and most gamers will have little trouble arranging the flow of raw materials, storage * **** Population Explosion APPEAL: HardCAESAR core strategists.

"RAWAL scenario type, your path through the campaign will present you with an impressive variety of situations and planning challenges. This overlay of plot and game direction lends, in my opinion, a much needed storyline to the august series of \"building\" games that comprise CAESAR III's lineage. Instead of building city after city along the same lines, you must tailor your efforts to the requirements of the scenario. CAESAR III will require different goals from you in terms of how your city looks, while the local situation will present obstacles to be overcome and, if Rome's enemies are around, throw some nasty curve balls at you. (Those Carthaginian elephant troops can be a real problem, if your walls aren't thick enough.) At each new level the designers also throw in some twists (natives, wolf packs, increased dependence on trade) that go a long way toward keeping the game fresh. On the whole, CAESAR III is a magnificent accomplishment. It comes with a thorough manual, a good tutorial, and useful online help functions. The game ran smoothly on my Pentium 166, even when the large cities created a fairly complicated graphical screen. It never crashed once, which for any program running on Windows 95 pretty much amounts to voodoo as much as solid programming, Fighting in Ancient Rome as you wait for your peace and prosperity levels to rise.

"REVIEW AGE OF EMPIRES: THE RISE OF ROME When in Rome The AOE X-pack Is More Than the Sum of Its Parts ONLINE by Ken Brown GE OF EMPIRES is essentially a game of rock, paper, scissors. A good human or computer player can counter any unit or strategy with something else. There's no silver-bullet strategy, and that is, in part, what brings gamers back time and time again. For the RISE OF ROME, Ensemble Studios sought to add new civilizations, units, and technologies to those of the original game, while at the same time improving play balance. The design team's goal was to add new counters to strong units and to make some of the weaker units more attractive. They've succeeded and, with a few interface enhancements and Al tweaks, the game is now easier to play. It isn't AGE OF EMPIRES II, but HANNIBAL'S MARCH One of the campaigns lets you lead Carthaginian war elephants against the Romans. SEE ELLIOTT CHIN'S X-PACK CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES ON www.gameguides.com like, but you'll only build as many as your resources will allow. You cannot queue more than one type of unit within each building, and there are no gathering points, which is unfortunate. If you play solo, the heart of the game is still the random maps. Several new map types freshen up the field, especially the Mediterranean map, which requires that you control the water to win. Ensemble tweaked the pathfinding and unit Al to make units respond faster to threats. Despite this units still get stuck sometimes and enemy units occasionally slip by unmolested. Salty AOE vets will find plenty to dig into here. RISE OF ROME isn't a quantum leap over the original game, but it freshens the experience, improves the mechanics, and beefs up the computer opponents. I certainly recommend it to any diehard AOE player—it'll keep the Hun fires burning until AGE OF EMPIRES II. CGW it delivers enough cool new fea tures to rekindle your jones. and armored elephants inflict damage on adjacent units. Once you upgrade to the scythe chariot, you can build them with just food and wood. This can be a major advan tage as gold supplies dwindle in the Iron Age. Last, the fire galley is a devastating naval unit that eats triremes for lunch. It breathes fire onto anything next to it, and serves well in coastal defense, although it is susceptible to siege weapons. COMPUTER WORL * * * * * Queue Ball RISE OF ROME's new unit queues made me wonder how we got by without them in the first game. You can queue up as many units as you Friends, Romans, Countrymen... The biggest features in RISE are the new civilizations and units. The Romans aren't as strong as you might expect, although they do have a construction advantage and fanatical swordsmen. The Carthaginians, however, can open up a giant can of whup-ass on the Romans-or any other civilization, for that matter. They get more of the new units, special naval advantages, and +25 percent hit points for academy and elephant units. The Macedonians offer a new counter to the dreaded priest strategy, with units four times more resistant to conversion. But Macedonians can't research the wheel, limiting their units and productivity. The Palmyrans have uber villagers, but they cost 50 percent more than other civs, rendering them vulnerable early on. The five new units add interesting counters to the units of the original game. Stone-throwing slingers have an attack bonus against archers and fortifications. Camel riders enjoy a +8 attack vs. Cavalry and other horse-mounted units. Both the new scythe chariots Ken Brown is an avid priest hunter and a master of the phalanx rush. He's also the Executive Editor here at CGW. APPEAL: AGE OF EMPIRES fans who can't wait for ACE II. PROS: Enough new stuff to revitalize the game; unit queues make a big difference.

With a classic plot like that and an entertaining display that turns the computer screen into a miniatures playland, this import from Germany's Topware Interactive is not without its charm.

Another oddity is the constant reference to corn rather than wheatsince corn is indigenous to North America. Players looking for verisimilitude between the game and actual Medieval village life will be disappointed. The characters and landscape details give KNIGHTS AND MERCHANTS a charm that's hard to resist.

"REVIEW  WAR ALONG THE MOHAWK French and Indian Ware STRATEGYZWARE Neither the French, the Indians, nor the English Fares Well in This Loser FL I L IKUS by Bob Proctor she French and Indian War took place in North America about 20 years before the American Revolution. Europe was embroiled in the Seven Years War, and English and French colonists each saw an opportunity to expand at the other's expense. Had this war remained an affair between professional armies it would have been little noticed. But both sides enlisted the aid of natives who took the war to the civilian populace. This should make for a fascinating game. But nothing about WAR ALONG THE MOHAWK will excite history buffs or gamers. Neither Fish nor Fowl Despite the copy on the box, MOHAWK is hardly the game \"where role playing meets realtime strategy.\" The game is sort of an RPG in single-player mode and sort of a real-time strategy/ wargame in multiplayer mode. The concept for multiplayer is that all players select up to eight characters and fight a war of attrition until only one is left. But in practice it's totally unplayable; as soon as the game starts, all the characters run away and the game ends. The single-player mode has some elements of an RPG but is nowhere close to X-COM or IMPLAUSIBLE MISSION Here is our party of five soldiers (and a woman) leaving for their mission.

"REVIEW CREATURES 2 They're Dead, Jim SSICS/PUZZ Natural Selection Goes Awry in This Depressing Update by Dawn Jepsen evoted fans of Mindscape's CREATURES artificial life program have anxiously awaited the arrival of CREATURES 2, which promised Norns genetically complex enough to appeal to the likes of Dr. Moreau, as well as a genetic splicing machine for all your mad scientists' needs. I confess I had visions of my own little Galapagos; the strongest and smartest not just surviving, but flourishing, within their changing environment. How little did I realize that these darling, some times devilish Norns had minds of their own. And this stubborn independence was going to lead many of these cute little creatures to their demise, despite my best efforts to help them. THE ROAD TO HELL A Norn finds its way into the Grendel's lair, a dangerous place. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD The Norns are now far more structurally complex and, as a result, more delicate. The environ. ment is less friendly for dynasty building, but certainly proves more interesting after hours of gameplay. Albia now has seasons, complete with seasonal plants, animals, and variable temperatures that affect Norn activity and health. The addition of these varia bles does not come without its price. I lost 27 Norns within five Albian hours. CREATURES 2 is touted as an artificial life program. After several frustrating hours of play. I was bitterly referring to it as an artificial death program. I learned the hard way that the new Norns now possess organs, including hearts and lungs. Norns are curious by nature and unfortunately few have little fear regarding the exploration of *** APPEAL: Fans of the original CREATURES looking creatures for a greater fiets A Better place The overall premise of CREATURES 2 doesn't differ tremen dously from the original; hatch some eggs, help your Norns explore their world, and get down to breeding your very own biodiverse, genetically mutated Darwinian dynasty. What does differ is the effort needed by the gamer to make all of this happen. The Norns are darling little animals resembling the Mogwai from the film Gremlins. Each Norn contains its own \"digital DNA,\" which sets its distinct characteristics-personality, intelligence, and even physiology. While basically sweet-natured, some Norns possess a mischievous side. They're extremely affectionate and often even attempt to befriend the likes of the Grendel, a diseasecarrying and rather violent little monster. In CREATURES 2, the Norns continue to live in lush and Edenesque Albia. This time, though, its surface has been destroyed by a violent volcano. What remains is a much more primitive and challenging arena in which to raise Norns. for a greater challenge, sadists. PROS: The everchanging and adapting Nors keep gameplay from becoming predictable, despite the constancy of situation and environment. CONS: Death-prone Norns make game play difficult and frustrating: annoying scrolling problems; limited viewing areas make locating Norns challenging. DIFFICULTY: Advanced. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166, Windows 95/98, 16MB RAM, 2MB video card, 2x CD-ROM drive, 16-bit sound card. 3D SUPPORT: None. MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: None.

"REVIEW  CREATURES 2 Digital DNA 2007 SWISS Me eat bab water. With several lake and pond areas present in the vast expanse of Albia, it's not difficult to lose a few Norns to drowning. They look quite happy moving about in the water, with no real signs of distress Eventually however, a drowning Norn will curl up in sleep position and develop little stars over its head. At that point, the science kit can be opened and your Norn can be injected with defibrillate to restart its heart. Usually, a Norn can be resuscitated in this way, but often they seem \"off\" for a while. ended up exporting them from the program while I learned how to help them. Obviously, I was relieved to learn that I was not a terrible parent. Cyberlife apparently had so many complaints about stupid Norns that the company created new eggs that could be downloaded from the Web. Since I was losing about half of my waterhappy Norns to the lake, I also downloaded electric fences for the periphery of all the water in Albia.! named my first new and improved Norn \"Hope,\" on the off chance that her fates may be guided by her name. Alas, she was dead in just 20 minutes. Survival of the Fittest A rare sighting, (right) of a baby Norn actually eating; you'll lose many generations of Norns with Ally McBeal-like eating habits early in the game. ondering how later generations of creatures will differ from their forefathers and mothers? Because of distinctiveness of each individual Norn, the genetics in the game mimic real life. Each creature (including the Grendel and the new Albia inhabitant, the Ettin) has its own DNA. With 550 individual genes to manipulate, there are countless potential Norn varieties. As in life, stronger traits do seem to be passed on to future generations. Once I had several very healthy Norns, many of their babies would begin eating whatever was nearby without ever being shown to do so. Norns also come in different colors, sometimes with a contrasting hair color and length. Others have cute little knee boots or unusual hairstyles. These variables all get passed on to create a myriad of distinctly different Norns. CREATURES has inspired a community to rival that of pet breeders. Some of the most popular CREATURES Web pages offer Norn adoption centers. Here, gamers can exchange Norns of unusual colors, personality traits, breeding abilities, or life spans. Also available on many pages are COBS (CREATURES OBjects). COBS are items created by both Cyberlife and individual gamers. Players will find toys, food, and many objects designed to make life in Albia easier or more interesting. You'll find links to dozens of sites at www.creatures2.com. Lemming-like Behavior Albia now has gravity as well. Some Norns appear to have a rather low self-preservation instinct and have little problem stepping off a cliff. While it's not likely that a Norn will die from this, it may injure him and alter his health status. The average life span of a Norn is supposedly about 10 hours, but they can, and do, die in any number of ways much earlier in life. Certainly the most frustrating way in which this happens is from starvation. While most Norns learn to feed themselves at a very young age, approximately half of my initial babies never learned to eat To make matters worse, because of their increased brain capacity, CREATURES 2's Norns have improved speaking skills. They also now understand concepts, and have an increased variety of facial expressions. So imagine, if you will, your beloved Norn looking right at you with its big, sad eyes and turned-down mouth and saying \"Emmie extrmly hngry. Get Mamma,\" all the while dying next to a big piece of cheese. I thought about naming all my Norns after ex-boyfriends to prevent becoming too attached, but eventually I just Hope in the End Eventually, I did get several seemingly healthy Norns out of the new batch. The \"natural birth\" second generation of Norns possessed greater survival and communication skills, and started living longer and healthier lives. Several generations later I had very few starving, sleepy, or bored Norns. But I wonder how many people will have the patience to watch generation after generation of cute little Norns die before achieving a species with the basic capability to survive? At a point, CREATURES 2 does evolve into a game that's a richer, more challenging, more living version of the original. But the Norn graveyard will be so littered with corpses by then that many adult gamers will have given up in frustration—and young children playi ng the game will probably need counseling after the experience. Get past that point, though, and you'll find that the new, larger Albia does make for a more interesting place to raise Norns. CREATURES 2's 16-bit color graphics are gorgeous. Exotic plants and animals abound and change with the seasons. Just be careful—the way to Eden is not as safe as it may seem at first. CGW READING IS FUNDAMENTAL You'll use the computer to teach baby Norns words. Once they have a vocabulary, you can converse with them by typing.

With the lives of innocent hostages and the members of your team hanging in the balance, every move must be executed with fore. thought and precision. To help you new recruits rise to the challenge in RAINBOW SIX, we will run through some of the fundamental skills and tactics you must master to succeed in both campaign missions and multiplayer battles.

Nonetheless, there are many ways you can improve your hit percentages in various situa. tions. For example, when sniping from afar, kneel down to improve your aim. And when using an M-16 or CAR-15, always fire short, oneto three-round bursts. The accuracy of these powerful weapons deteriorates so rapidly on full automatic (see \"Gun Control\" sidebar) that longer bursts are a waste of ammunition unless the target is at point-blank range. How you move also influences the effectiveness of your fire. Stopping, starting, and changing speeds will all temporarily upset your aim. Accuracy does return if you continue the movement (though the larger and heavier the gives it a huge advantage over assault rifles during close-range combat.

"Adventure/RPG FINAL FANTASY VII Simulation/SpaceSim INDEPENDENCE WAR 2:51 BYRNE. THE CPU ON THE DOEN SHOULD STOP MANUFACTURING HEA TER Fun and Games at the Gold Saucer re you finding that the more realistic physics of INDEPENDENCE WAR are cramping your spacefar ing style? During flight, enter cheat mode by typing darkgoat, then type in one of the codes below. As always, you should make sure to back up your save-game files before you try using any cheats. -Terry Coleman Code Dock with any vessel Explode targeted ship Force next mission event Freeze target Invulnerability Jump to lagrange point Jump to target Match target's velocity Superspeed View previous movie Win the mission Result Left-shift + k Left-shift + 0 (zero) Left-shift + S Left-shift +; Left-shift + i Left-shift + j Left-shift + 8 Left-shift + 9 Left-shift + a Left-shift + backspace Left-shift + w elcome to the famous Gold Saucer, where adventurers come from all over Sorpigal to race thoroughbred Chocobo. If you breed a gold Chocobo and ride your steed to victory in the S-class races, you will be rewarded with Counter Attack materia. Each Counter Attack entitles the wearer to-you guessed it-one potential counterattack in normal combat. So, grabbing a number of these instantly boosts the firepower of your party. When you win enough races in the S-class, you'll get a prize package that includes a pair of Sprint Shoes, which grant automatic haste in battle. And for our runners-up, there's always Rice-A-Roni, the multidimensional retreat. (Yes, we're kidding; buy your own vermicelli --Ed.). Worthy heroes should also prove their prowess in the Battle Square, earning battle points to buy Speed Plus and Pre-Emptive materia, Cloud's Omnislash manual, and W-Summon (which allows a character to cast two summon spells per turn). Once you have purchased Omnislash and W-Summon and have killed the Ultimate Weapon, have Cloud learn Omnislash, and equip him with his ultimate weapon and W-Summon. Then enter the Battle Square for a special series of battles. If you win, your prize is the Final Attack materia that lets you cast a connected spell before dying: Attach it to Phoenix or Revive. When you're fighting in the Battle Square, be sure that you have Big Guard, White Wind, and some attack spells; spell effects will carry over from battle to battle. A Ribbon is very helpful in protecting you against most status effects, and you should cast Big Guard fairly early on, then cast Regen when you become worried about hit points. Other useful materia to equip are Restore, Counter Attack, HP Absorb, and MP Absorb attached to Deathblow or other materia. Steal Mime, HP Plus, MP Plus, and Speed Plus are also helpful if they fit with your fighting style. Remember that all ill effects from fighting in the Battle Square (including death) last only while you're in the arena. -Petra Schlunk he two patches to SSI'S PANZER COMMANDER have given us more accurate vehicle modeling, better pathfinding, more aggressive Al combat, and even two new vehicles. The most significant change, however, is in how the game system deals with gunnery. You can now toggle the Al gunner and the illuminated reticule, which lets you use the Mark I eyeball to spot a target instead of relying on a glowing beacon. What used to be an intimidating 102-percent difficulty shot thus becomes a manageable 76 percent. Gameplay is improved, because you have to scan the field more carefully and pop out of the cupola more often than in PANZER COMMANDER 1.0. The restricted width of the magnified gunner's position (the F7 key) and the time used to adjust for range makes the previously little-used F5 position, with its broader field of vision, invaluable. Even when firing the coaxial machine gun, you can now find the range much more quickly than before. The greater aggressiveness of the computer opponent means that Al tanks open up at longer range, and this, combined with enemy vehicles that sport improved armor means that your fire discipline becomes more important. Banging away at a target when you first spot it will merely exhaust your limited ammunition. Learn to use cover to close to an effective range, and maneuver for a shot at a vulnerable enemy point. In short, the 1.2 patch adds a lot to an already good game, and I heartily recommend it. Jim Cobb COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JANUARY 1999 311 DS Tips TODS Tios COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  JANUARY 1999 377, "

"The First Annual Greenspeak Awards Or, My Big Excuse to Loudly Shout, \"I'm the King of the World!\" you know, they're archaic now. Brilliant, guys. Next year, try leaving out the monitor, hard drive, and CD-ROM drive too. That'll make the machines easier to lift when we toss them into the garage. \"I've got a flying machine!\" almost named my daughter \"Zug Zug.\" So the cancellation of the WARCRAFT adventure game hit me hard. I actually plan on remaining in a permanent bad mood about it until WARCRAFT III comes out. So until then, just keep away from me. gamers can learn to play your games after buying them, okay? think you can afford it. And while you're at it, slip Bill an extra $50 to get a decent haircut. Geniuses of the Year WizardWorks, for making DEER HUNTER. They saw a void, they came, and they filled it. And, appy New Year and welcome to the first annual Greenspeak Awards, hosted by me, Billy Crystal. Let me take a second, before we get to the awards, to apologize for My Giant. I won't make any more movies now. I promise. The Greenspeak Awards were created to recognize significant achievements in computer gaming over the past year-or at least the ones we can make fun of. Winners will receive absolutely nothing. So, without further ado, here's the creator of the Greenspeak Awards, Jeff Green. Please, everyone, stay seatedthe exits have been sealed. Thank you, Billy-nice haircut. First off, please note that these awards should not be confused with any official, important CGW awards. This is just another blatant attempt to draw attention to myself in hopes, once again, that someone will notice me. Should anyone want to put this award on their game box, rememberI'm cheap and easy. Okay, on with the awards. Worst Trend of the Year Big-breasted gun-toting babes. You know, if we were talking about real big-breasted, gun-toting babes, I might have called this the best trend of the year. But guys, Lara Croft and all these other computer chicks? They're not real. Please stop drooling over them now. It's pathetic. Let's all make a resolution right now to talk to some real girls in 1999. I know they're Please Put Your Clothes Back on and Go Away Award Gillian Bonner, the former Playboy Playmate responsible for RIANA ROUGE, the most embarrassing, awful game of the year. Imagine Janet Reno in a butt thong, and you're just beginning to get an idea of what a cold shower this supposedly erotic adventure game was. Yeeeesh. Pathetic Weasels of the Year All the jerks who got on battle.net to play STARCRAFT JEFF GREEN Let's all make a resolution right now to talk to some real girls in 1999 boy, did they clean up. Everyone in the industry spent the first half of the year making fun of it, then the second half trying to copy it and cash in. You don't have to admire the game itself, but you gotta love anything that makes the entire gaming industry, press included, look stupid. scary and are shaped different than Lara Croft, but, on the plus side, they'll actually talk back to you, and they'll always know where your keys are. pretending to be newbies, for the sole purpose of padding their rankings by beating on real newbies who were trying to learn how to play the game. This is called being a bully. This is called being a coward. You hear me, \"Sean Yves\"? I hate you. CGW Boneheads of the Year Apple Computer. It takes Apple's perfected blend of arrogance, stupidity, and flat-out delusional thinking to top themselves year after year, but hey, you don't reduce yourself to a sub-5 percent market share with out a lot of effort! This year's Darwinian move was releasing the otherwise kinda cool iMac without a floppy drive. Because, Bummer of the Year Blizzard's cancellation of WARCRAFT ADVENTURES: LORD OF THE CLANS. I admit my bias: I am a WARCRAFT freak. I dream of being in Azeroth. I have been known to wake up screaming Cheapskates of the Year Microsoft, for failing to include written manuals in a number of its games, including MICROSOFT GOLF, 3D BASEBALL, and MOTOCROSS MADNESS. Hey, guys, now that you practically own the entire world, try taking a crowbar or stick of dynamite to Bill Gates' giant money vault and pony up for manuals so that What Jeff doesn't realize is that \"Sean Yves\" is actually the pseudonym of his mother, who enjoyed routinely kicking his butt in STARCRAFT all year long.
