If you're not sure how to shop for those of us who have been virtually good all year, I hope it emboldens you to action. Finding the right game is rewarding in itsell, but you'll be amazed how enthusiastically the recipient wants to share his/her new toy with you. magine you had a gift list full of celebrities, and you wanted to give them the right computer game. How would you go about doing it? The whole process of choosing the right computer game is essen. tially a game of matching needs and interests with good games. he has an old 68020, 68030, 68040 or Power Mac processor. You need to know that, because if you buy him VIRTUAL POOL (so he can rack up balls without suffering from second-hand cigarette smoke), he'll need a Power Mac. You'll also need do know the speed and memory of the individ ual's computer. Say Ronald Reagan hasn't upgraded his machine since his presidency. Even with a 386 machine and less than 2 MB of memory, he could still play an old version of PRESIDENT ELECT '88, but you might have to find a budget package of older games like THE DEFINITIVE WARGAME COLLECTION to meet his other gaming needs. Meanwhile, Nancy wouldn't even be able to consult the latest version of CYBERTAROT with that machine. Of course, if you're buying for a Stephen Spielberg, an individual who upgrades his machine pretty regularly, loves action games and flight sims, and plays a lot of QUAKE, you've got an easier task. Just get him X-WING VERSUS TIE FIGHTER or the latest first-person shooter. You may set back shoot. ing on his next film, but you'll make him happy. question is how FAST the CD-ROM drive is. A single speed or 2x CDROM just doesn't cut it with today's games. You need 4x or faster. If, for example, you buy Hillary Clinton a copy of THE NEVERHOOD CHRONICLES (it's not a village, but a \"neverhood\"), it may play on a 2x CD-ROM, but the delightful animated cut-scenes will hang for a few seconds while the drive access tries to catch up with the onscreen action. The first lady may feel like a third-world lady because of the slow disk drive. Does the gamer have a joystick or gamepad? Some games, like 1943: EUROPEAN AIR WAR, which we picked out for George Bush, require them. Other games, like the NBA FULL COURT PRESS we picked out for the often retired Magic Johnson, benefit from gamepad control. Another significant peripheral you'll need to know about is sound card compatibility. If the individual's sound card is not Sound Blaster or Sound Blaster-compatible, you may wish to stick with Windows 95 products (assuming the gamer has Win 95). Windows handles most sound card drivers transparently and enables easier installation of games, as a result. Without this assist, there are still nightmares with such cards as the Gravis Ultrasound. Fortunately, all Sierra products take advantage of Win 95, so you can easily set up Supreme MAC OR PC? First, know something about the individual's computer. Bill Gates may own a Mac or two, but it's unlikely that he uses them as his game machine. Somehow, I think buying a game in the Windows environment is more likely to please him. We'll probably buy him a copy of Internet capable MONOPOLY OR CAPITALISM. Ralph Nader probably only has a Mac, and probably considers the PC to be unsafe at any speed. He believes in truth in labeling, so he'd be willing to tell you whether PERIPHERAL CONSIDERATIONS You used to need to know whether the gamer had a CD-ROM or not. Now, if they're gaming at all, they undoubtedly have one. The CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH THE UNBEARABLE RIGHTNESS OF BEING CONNECTED I just finished reading your October issuc. and I had to write to say you guys hit the nail on the head with this issue. I have been playing computer games for about eight years now and I have come to the point where will not buy a game unless it has multiplayer (modem specifically) built into it. The games I now own are NHL 96, NHL 97, MADDEN 97, FIFA SOCCER 96, WARCRAFT II, COMMAND & CONQUER, TOP CUN, DUKE NUKEM 3D, LINKS LS (excellent modem playd), CIVNET, and QUAKE. The only (new) game that I have that doesn't support] modem play is CIVILIZATION 2, which is a good game, but man would that be good with modem and Internet play!!! My point is that game publishers have to start to realize that they are throwing away a great deal of customers because they have no modem play. I am a huge fan of EA Sports games. I was so excited when I saw that NBA LIVE 96 was out! When I saw that it didn't have modem play, I didn't even bother with it. Same thing with Virgin's POWERPLAY 96, a fantastic game with two players, but boring with one player, and no modem play. Game publishers take note. Not only do gamers not buy your games without modem play, but they remember that you didn't have it before. Camers do hold grudges! Mike Frame Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA LET'S PLAY THE BACKWARDS GAME I just picked up the 15th anniversary issue and I must say sections devoted to the best, worst, etc., games are interesting and amusing to read. My favorite article was the 150 best games section. All my picks were there including the grandaddy of all first-person shoot-em-ups — MOOD (pg. 65).

"LETTERS So I'm stuck with one of the biggest game lemons of all time. I hope Sierra gets a free copy of the review. Thanks for the honesty! Mike Howes via the Internet Sierra did indeed see the review We'll see in the future if it had lasting impact. BIBLE OR BADASS? I was sorry to see the word \"baclass\" on the cover of your October 1996 issue, if for no other reason than the fact that I had to explain to my kids why it was all right for you to put the word on the cover. and all right for me to read the magazine, but that it was not all right for them to use the word in conversation. I am not objecting to \"mature\" content in your magazinc. I am merely disappointed that it was fcatured on the cover. CCW is clearly no longer the magazine that included Bible references in the masthead, and not all of the changes over the past 10 years have been positive. Jamie Adams via the Intemet sports section in your magazine; it has always been a game type ignored by lots of gaming magazines. The game type sections you use help keep a broad coverage of all types of games. On to the real reason I'm writing, your review of FPS Baseball 96. Your review was right on the money and brutally honest. Something other gaming magazines and most other mainstream magazines in general won't do. Sierra obviously pushed a beta version of a game out the door with FPSBB 96 and then spent forever not talking to their costumers and eventually releasing a patch that, while fixing a long list of bugs, clid not get the game to a fully playable sound like on another soundboard. And you've got to believe me, gamers who haven't heared MIDI sounds yet are urged to have a look at that site. When! first played the IM/OPL-3 sound and then let the Roland and Yamaha rock, I was swinging my butt all over the room bcfore I could say \"wow!\" Anyway, to make a long story short, I'm very keen on buying the Yamala SW50XG now. Good choice? Or better buy another SB16 and stick the SCD-15 on it? If you prefer another card, please tell me. Like I said, I would probably value your opinion above any other! T'or those who are also interested, here are some of the sites: http://www.rmplc.couk/mplc/md/m ustech/intsou.html http://www.yamaba.com; and littp://pulweb.acns.nwu.edu/-il1544/s ndsmpl.html Well now, about how brilliant your magazine is. I don't think I'll begin to praise you because I fear I won't stop. But for the record, you and your magazine are great! Eric Smalley Amstcheen, The Netherlands BILIER FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL PRO '96 SEASON SH Schwol teachers often say that course language is a placebo fora limited vocabulary. They may hane had a point, but somehow using cover lines like \"Saren Prodigious Fighting Games, \"\"7 Powerful Pugilistic Experiences,\" or \"Saven Sanguine and Stimulating lighting Games\" just didn't fit the message. For better or worse, we thought that \"badass» fit the tone of the games better than some more sesquipedaliem adjectres could have. The cover line was intended to shock or stimulate rather than offend. As for the Bible references, believe it or not, we used to receive offended letters on those too. And we also agree that change is a mixed bug. Of course, we believe most of the changes have been positive or we wouldn't have instituted them. CONSUMER RESEARCH I, like many gamers, am trying to tell my computer that the sky is the limit. Yet it will not agree with me, since don't have a top sounding wavetable. So I've done some researching on the Intemet and found some really valuable information, not only on the boards themselves but on MIDI, XG and other Icms as well, which are all such vital clements for a sound card to have. I read everything and came to the conclusion that the market has practically been dominated by the Roland and Yamaha products. Although Roland isn't focused on the computer world anymore, they still have one offthe-top-sounding wavctable daugliterboard: the Roland Sound Canvas SCD-10/15. Unfortunately I cliscovered that my Sound Blaster 16 Value Edition doesn't have a waveblaster connector So if I don't want to buy a new SB16 with connector, I'm stuck...I thought Luckily, I discovered the Yamaha products: Yamaha DB50XG and Yamaha SW50XC. Although the DB50XG is a daughtercard, the SW50XG is a stand-alone wavetable card that produces the same quality as the DB50XG and can be plugged in next to the already present Sound Blaster 16 or Sound Blaster-compatible card. Talso came across this great site: http://pubwebancs.nwu.edu/111544/sm dsmpl.html. Here, samples of different sound cards were clownloadabole. So you can actually hear what a tune would We think you're right. The XG chip sets are the high-end choice now that Roland hus unilaterally alsdicated the market. Corrections BASEBALL BANDAID Since our review, Sierra released a patch for FPS: Baseball Pro '96, which fixes many of the statistical and AI problems. You can download the patch at http:// www.sierra.com. In last month's issue we attributed the #5 vaporware title of all time, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, to Reichart von Wolfshield. Although Wolfshield was involved peripherally with the project, Jim Sachs was the game's designer. Also, it apparently wasn't Disney's legal department that torpedoed the game's release, but a planned tie-in with a 20,000 Leagues feature film that never came to fruition. Wolfshield said there's still hope that the game could eventually see the light of day. state. Now, rumor has it that Sierra won't release another patch for this game. Can you say, \"Outpost?\" They made eye candy and that's it. and it is by far the most disappointi ng game I've ever purchased. In waiting for the patch, my 30day money back guarantee ran out. TALKIN' BASEBALL Gushing in a letter always seems a little strange, but your review of Front Page Sports Baseball 96 bas pushed me over the edge. I'irst, a big thanks for having a regular CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"READ.ME Battlecruiser Captain Makes Last Stand BC 3000 Designer Protests Game's Release, Citing Bugs ** even years in development, Derek Smart's BC 3000 final. ly shipped in mid-October but not without a last-minute fight from the game's embattled creator. According to sources within Take 2, designer/programmer Smart was removed from Take 2's Latrobe, PA, production facility following a heated dispute over the company's plans to release the game. Smart was subsequently banned from Take 2's offices, and the company reportedly hired a security team to guard their offices for the last week of production. Officially, Take 2 had no com. ment on the incident. Privately, however, sources within the company indicated that Smart was removed by police and that he attacked a Coca-Cola machine during the incident. Smart confirmed that a blowup had occurred, though he denied any physical violence. According to Smart, the confrontation occurred as a result of Take 2's intention to master and ship the game in spite of a number of known bugs in the final copy. \"They just wanted to make their release date, and instead of waiting two weeks (for patches) they are shipping the game without a bug test,\" he said. \"Seven years of development went into making this game and now it is going to ship with bugs. It is stupid not to take two more weeks.\" Smart did not refer to his online comments of last year at this time that all that was keeping the game from shipping was \"the manual.\" BATTLECRUISER has a long and interesting history in the industry, having gone through numer. ous revisions and changes of personnel and producers before being signed by Take 2. Smart confirms he has acquired a rep utation of being \"eccentric and difficult to get along with.\" A source near the development team who refused to be named said that working with Smart was like being in the movie Apocalypse Now. \"You're on a boat ride and you can't even imagine what is lying at the end of the ride,\" the source quipped. Smart, for his part, maintains that his reputation is simply the result of dedication to releasing the best game. He added that he will be working on creating and distributing patches, on his own if necessary, to ensure that the game works as originally designed and lives up to its potential of being, in his words, \"the best game of the centu. ry.\" -John Withers Derek Smart ere are some of the hottest prod. lucts on the market, as well as the ones that frankly ain't so hot.

This is the first game from actor Robert De Niro's Tribeca Interactive, and it features a bunch of Hollywood names, which makes the mainstream press think they're looking at something important. Which isn't to say that this game isn't worthy of attention. It's just that, for experienced adventure gamers, there's not much new here-other than some impressively bizarre psychedelic artwork by Mark Ryden, and voice acting by such talents as Jim Belushi and Cher. The story is that you've inherited a rundown resort from your uncle (Christopher Reeve). that needs to be restored. Once you enter the resort, you find it has become a nightmarish, Dr. Seuss-on-acid funhouse, full of odd gadgets and a pair of sinister, flying creatures (Aerosmith's Steve Tyler and Joe Perry) who taunt you as you explore the place.

"READ.ME SSI's New Order Of Battle Pacific General and Panzer 97 Lead New Gaming Assault fter the runaway success of PANZER GENERAL SSI received dozens of sug. gestions for future games in the series. According to SSI's Bret Berry. the most requested site was the Pacific theater of WWII, which, with its emphasis on naval and amphibious operations, poses some unique problems for the classic PG system. SSI took on the challenge anyways, and the result will be called PACIFIC GENERAL. The naval rules for the upcoming game are totally different from PANZER GENERAL, from ranged off-shore bombardments to the ability to stack multiple naval units in a single space. You'll even have a simple, efficient method of refueling your naval aircraft and setting your combat air patrols. Lest you think that the game should instead be called \"Pacific Admiral,\" keep in mind the ferocious ground fighting on the island of Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima; the Japanese invasion of digitized 3D tank models, the crisp, clear rivers, and the stately European towns. The game sys. tem has also been revamped, with smoke, craters and even a little range fire. In addition, the campaigns and battles have all been redesigned, and they will be playable from the Allied side. But don't expect STEEL PANTHERS style realism; the emphasis here is still on fast, furious fun. If your battle plans run more toward real-time, SSI's fall 97 lineup tackles a lot of time periods.

"EAK PREVIEW STARFLEET ACADEMY Throughout the course of the game you'll encounter around 30 different ship types. The development team did stick close to Trek lore when setting specifications for these ships. For instance, in the origi nal series, the Gorn were able to sneak up on a Federation outpost and wipe it out. Thus, look for Gorn ships to be both powerful and stealthy. Similarly, in the episode \"Balance of Terror,\" the Enterprise was unable to outrun the Romulan plasma torpedoes by backing away from them. If the torpedoes were \"dumb\" weapons, all the ship would have had to do would be to move to the side. Thus, ACADEMY's designers figured the torpedoes had to have some tracking abilities. Look for all the other expected capabilities in the classic ships. Romulan and Klingon Birds of Prey can cloak, but they have to come out of hiding to fire. The Reliant has the fast-action \"chain-gun phasers\" seen in action in Star Trek II SHIELDS UP The Excelsior's shields glow as another torpedo prepares to strike: still screen shots can't properly capture the dazzling shield shimmer effect. pilot a starship. While the game's fast-action combat sequences will likely have the WING COMMANDER Crowd jumping for joy, they're likely to disappoint Trek purists. Much of the early hype about STARFLEET ACADEMY centered around the game being a starship simulator, instead of an arcade game that had you flying the Enterprise around with a joystick. Alas, that's not how the combat design evolved. Although there's more strategy to the combat sequences than the typical WING COMMANDER-style arcade action, the action is nothing like what you actually see in the Trek series or films. Designer Rusty Buchert says the team had originally considered a setup more faithful to the series, where you'd issue combat orders to your crew members. However, the developers determined that the pacing of the game would be slower than the typical submarine sim if they'd gone for that design. Although many of us-Trek fans, sim play ers, and strategy gamers alike-would have preferred such a design even with a slower pace, Interplay apparently was concerned about mass appeal. It's a shame they didn't offer both a strategy and arcade combat as an option. That's not to say combat in this game isn't fun. Although battle sequences are essentially 3D arcade-style combat with a sprinkle of tactical flavor, joystick response is crisp, and the wide variety of poten. tial opponents will force you to develop varying attack strategies. Attacking an unshielded ship armed with fast-firing torpedoes is sig. nificantly different than trying to destroy a cloaked cruiser that reap pears only to take potshots at you. Combat isn't just point-and-shoot, despite its action orientation. You can use your sensors to target specific systems on enemy ships. You might aim at sensor banks if you just want to blind an opponent to get them to stop shooting and negotiate. Conversely, targeting the \"neck\" of a tenacious Klingon D7 is the quickest way to destroy it. Around 20 different systems can be targeted. Locking on a particular subsystem isn't a guarantee that that's what you'll hit, though. If you're going for precision, you'll want to stick with phasers, as photon torpedoes aren't pinpoint weapons. ENGINEERING LEVEL Cadet's Log, Stardate 8124.1. Graduation is approaching. Throughout this training course, I've had to master diplomacy, strategy, and scientific investigation. Starship combat is a bit more fast-paced than I expected, but it's exhilarating once you get used to it.

I took Bill to the vel to get him fixed and the Doc filled me in on the species. Stop feeding them, and they stop breeding. Unfortunately, I had 2,495 of them by the time she told me. There was no way I was going to take Ll. Finney's sug. gestion of selling them to that Rigelian restaurateur, but I'm not sure their final fate was much better.

"THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE: PART | Gaming The fastest recent Gaming P P-2011 P U S camere Cmale 7 Major Computer Makers Vie For The Ultimate Game Machine Title P-200 BY DAVE SALVATOR C makers have finally come to a realization: There's gold in them thar gamers. While a handful of small vendors have made game-optimized systems for sev eral years, the big manufacturers haven't really played in our backyarduntil now, that is. With the likes of Micron and Compaq jumping into the fray, it would seem the industry's larger players have taken a sudden interest in supplying your next gaming system. The good news is that all these new entrants make for a more competitive market, driving the price of a new killer gaming rig down. With memory prices bottoming out at unprecedented low levels and Intel continuing to aggressively price faster Pentium chips, this year's entrants all pack at least 200 MHz CPUs, 32 MB of EDO DRAM, and a minimum of 256 KB of Level 2 cache. The other notable addition to gaming rigs this year is 3D graphics, with three vendors using Diamond's Monster 3D based on 3Dfx's venerable Voodoo chip set, and one opting for the NEC/VideoLogic PowerVR chip. Some entrants opted for S3's ViRGE, while one punted on 3D hardware altogether. This year, we take a look at seven hot new systems, and also give you the lowdown on the optimal laptop gaming rig. We used an array of tests in both DOS and Windows 95, and present the results to you graphically to better tell the story. There are a lot of performance num. bers to consider before deciding on a system, but more importantly, who packs the biggest wallop without emptying your wallet? Let's get down to it and see. tower system include audio CD transport controls-Play, Stop, Next Track, and so on-located at the top-front of the system unit. There are also controls to enable/disable Presario's telephony functionality: yes, it's not just a game machine, it's an answering machine, too. Rounding out these controls are the curious 0 button, which invokes Compaq's extensive help engine to answer questions you may have about the system, and a button to enable/disable the 8712's sleep mode. Other nice ergonomic touches include a volume knob on the monitor that controls the master volume level in Windows 95. Compaq tapped speaker veteran JBL to design the 8712's speaker system. The two powered satellites and one woofer sound terrific for music and gaming audio as well. Compaq includes ThrustMaster's new gamepad with this system, though final drivers weren't available at press time. Another interesting component is the NEC/VideoLogic PowerVR 3D graphics chip, a 3D-only chip that shows promise, though little firm performance data is available yet. Installation and assembly were painless, since Compaq color-codes of all their wiring and includes a large, illus. trated installation guide.

"THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE: PARTI ZEPHYR COMPUTING ONYX SPEED DEMON PROS: Good bang for the buck, solid scores almost across the board. CONS: Unimpressive 3D graphics performance. Price: $3,800 ourworld.compuserve.com /homepages/zephyr_computing_corporation (800) 448-8806 DE BONE ZEPHYR COMPUTING ONYX SPEED DEMON S B. 0923 ILI 2011 O We took a look at Zephyr's Onyx earlier this year, and after some initial glitches, wound up reviewing a pretty impressive system that was competitively priced. The successor to that system, the Onyx Speed Demon, follows the same path, delivering solid performance (except in one key area, 3D graphics) and hitting a price point of about $3,800. Setup went off without much difficulty, with some labels on the The Fastest Gaming PCs Let's Do The Numbers ud prising somewhere up the road. What Toshiba has done is smoothly integrate an FM receiver, cable-ready TV tuner, speakerphone, and telephony system into a PC. The first thing you notice sitting in front of the Infinia is the control panel on the front of the monitor, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) device that includes controls for the above-mentioned AV devices as well as a volume knob to control the master volume level in Windows 95. The volume knob doesn't work under DOS, though. Using these controls, you can drive the AV applications while hardly touching the keyboard or mouse. Also included is an infrared remote control which also has these functions, in addition to mouse functionality. Installation is painless, with good documentation, and color-coded cabling helps get Infinia up and running in minutes. The AMI BIOS offers minimal but sufficient access to system-level adjustments. Infinia's case opens sans tools, and its motherboard layout is such that all components are readily accessible. I know what you're thinking: \"Hey Shakespeare, shut yer pie hole and tell it: Is this is a good gaming rig, or what?\" So let's move on. For gamers, the first thing that's missing is a game controller of any kind. Second, the audio system-ported for better bass response and integrated into the monitor-sounds pretty good, but lacks any serious strength at the low end and goes into distortion somewhat early. Turning to the performance numbers, Toshiba fared pretty well in DOS tests, placing anywhere from second best to mid-pack. Its Windows 95 performance, however, didn't really follow suit. Though its disk and CD-ROM scores were respectable, its CPU scores were smack in the middle, and its 3D graphics performance was the slow. est of the lot. Toshiba has come up with an intriguing rig for early adapters hell. bent on blazing the convergence trail. But does this a killer gaming rig make? Not really. Its numbers are respectable, most notably in DOS, and its ease-of-use with the embedded AV devices is com mendable. But certain key performance areas are lacking-specifically, 3D graphics performance-and its performance otherwise in Windows 95 is unremarkable. The benchmarks in this article concern several key performance areas, and give a good indication of what you can expect out of these systems. In addition to the graphs on these pages, we have posted some additional performance data on our web site. Some of the numbers are pretty straightforward, like frame rates from DOS and Win 95 games, but others are a bit more esoteric. In Winbench 96, the Graphics WinMark score is derived from performing graphical tasks similar to those performed by real-world busi ness applications, ranging from word processors to graphics design programs. Speedy execution of business application tasks may not be directly relevant to gaming performance, but this kind of performance can be important for, oh let's just call it the Spousal Rationalization Factor. In testing Direct3D performance, we used Microsoft's Direct3D Test application that ships with their DirectX SDK. This tool is far from perfect, and in some ways isn't very \"game-like, but it does give an indication of a system's Direct3D performance. We look at two types of performance from Direct3D Test: pixel throughput and polygon throughput. Polygon throughput is the number of rendered polygons the card is able to generate. More kilopolygons per second means greater scene complexity. Pixel fill rate is a measure of how fast a graphics card can write pixels to its local memory. Higher pixel fill rate numbers will also probably yield better overall gaming performance. All of the numbers here combine to tell the story. If a machine does well across the board, you can be it'll move things along smartly on your favorite power-hungry game. CG DECEMBER 1996 "

The Speed Demon uses an Asus motherboard and an Award BIOS, which gives detailed, low-level control of system settings, most notably on memory timings. The mini-tower case makes all components easily accessible, though it appears that Falcon and Zephyr have happened upon the same case supplier. In fact, given the number of similarities, the Speed Demon almost appears to be a Falcon Mach V clone. These similarities extend to the audio subsystem: both rigs ship with standard Sound Blaster 16s and have the Altec Lansing ACS55 speakers. The only difference here is that Falcon uses Yamaha's DB50XG daughterboard, whereas Zephyr opted for Roland's SCD-10 board. Both sound terrific, by the way. The Speed Demon was a solid performer in just about every area except one: 3D graphics, where it performed poorly. But its DOS performance was nipping at the heels of Falcon's, and its WinBench scores continued this pattern, actually nudging past Falcon on the 800x600 Graphics WinMark test. Using Diamond's Stealth 2000 3D, which is based on S3's VIRGE chip, Zephyr posted very good 2D performance, but its 3D performance wasn't nearly as impressive. These scores were second-to-last across the board, beating out only Toshiba. The addition of a solid 3D-only board would quickly remedy the problem, but the lack of one here leaves Zephyr's 3D performance wanting. Zephyr has put together a good package of hardware components, all of which con. spire to deliver very good performance in most departments. If the one glaring shortcoming can be addressed, Zephyr could have a winner on its hands. January We'll show you how to build a killer gaming machine from the ground up.

"THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE: PARTI Gaming On The Run A Guide To Finding The Right Laptop For Portable Gaming Video output, great if you want to play your favorite PC games on the family big-screen TV. Also, we recommend a system with a pointing stick or trackball. GlidePoint-style touchpads don't provide the precise control necessary for gaming. Consider a PS/2 port splitter that will allow you to plug in an external keyboard and mouse simultaneously, for those games that make heavy use of the numeric keypad. most of today chines. Multimedia units with The Ultimate Portable Game Machine P-200 by Denny Atkin ith Pentium 100 laptops now the entry-level, most of today's portables make at least service. able game machines. Multimedia units with sound and CD have dropped into the $2500 range. That's still $1000 more than a similarly equipped desktop unit, but it beats the $5000 prices for similar units only a year ago Here's our rundown of the various specifications you should check out before dropping a few grand on a high-performance gaming lap P-200 top. The Fastest Gaming PCs e tested some of the hottest notebooks on the mar. ket in an effort to find a unit with all the features a gamer looks for Our runners-up were all good machines in many respects, but all suffered at least one fatal flaw. Micron's Transport is incompatible with joystick cards, and its screen-stretching feature causes 640x480 games to look ter. rible; Toshiba's Satellite Pro units are good entry-level laptops, but without L2 cache they can't provide the necessary perfor mance for action games and sims; and HP's Omnibook 5500CT fails only in having a very short battery life and a very high street price. Toshiba's Tecra 510 and 730 series units are top-notch technically, but chronic shortages make them nearly impossible to find in-stock. And the winner is...Compaq's Armada 4130T. This modular unit does nearly everything right for the gamer. A fast 133-MHz Mobile Pentium is backed up with 256K of L2 cache and 16 MB of RAM. The 11.8-inch TFT screen is sharp and displays 65,000 colors in 800x600 resolution with no screen stretching. The floppy drive and CD-ROM can be used simultaneously (a rare feature in portables), the touchpad can be replaced with a slick little trackball, up to three batteries can be installed to provide over eight hours of on-the-road gaming, and an NTSC output lets you play games using your television The Armada's gaming strength comes from its Mobile CD Unit (MCDU), a two pound add-on that fastens to the bottom of the five-pound base unit. This not only contains a CD-ROM (an anemic 4x drive-the system's only weak point, which will hope. fully be upgraded soon) but also a joystick port, room for an extra battery, and two crisp-sounding speakers. The MCDU also adds support for wavetable MIDI sound, a feature found on none of the other note books we tested. Prices range from $2499 (100 MHz DSTN Armada 4110) to $4499 (133-MHz TFT Armada 4130T); the MCDU is $429. 002d Processor: 100 to 133-MHz Mobile Pentium. Although 150 MHz units are now available, they run at a slower bus speed (60 MHz vs. 66 MHz for the 133) and provide little or no performance improvement. Also, the 150-MHz chip uses slightly more power than the 133. Avoid units that use desktop Pentium chips-these use much more power and run hotter. Cache: 256K synchronous burst L2 cache. Cache memory is vital to game performance, especially with 120 MHz and faster Pentiums. RAM: 16 MB is minimum for Win 95 gaming. CD-ROM: A must. Some systems still ship with 4x drives, but 10x and faster drives should be available by Christmas. Screen: If you primarily play turn-based games, RPGs, or adven. tures, a DSTN passive-matrix screen will do. If you play simulation, action, sports, or real-time strategy games, you'll want a TFT active. matrix screen. DSTN screens have a slow update rate and leave ghostly trails in fast-action games. Note also that most newer TFT screens support 16-bit color, while DSTN displays are limited to only 256 colors. One feature to avoid is \"screen stretching.\" Some notebooks stretch 640x480 screens so they fill an entire 800x600 display Although this avoids the squashed, letterbox effect of displays without this feature, it also results in a jagged, \"messy\" display. Sound: 16-bit Sound Blaster compatibility. Creative Labs and ESS chip sets provide the fewest compatibility woes. Joystick Port: Built-in. If you get a unit that has a standard joy. stick port, or one on a docking station, you'll save yourself many headaches. There's only one fully Win 95 and DOS game-compatible joystick port card available (JC Designs GameCard II, a PCMCIA card available from Flight Sim Central at 800-477-SIMS). And some machines, such as the Micron Transport, won't work with this or any other joystick game card due to the way they allocate motherboard resources. Batteries: Lithium-Ion (LI). Older-technology Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries have a shorter life and suffer from memory effects that can reduce charge capacity over time. Other Considerations: Many portables support NTSC and S. or CG DECEMBER 1996 "

Jill, you grab his CD-ROM. Doc, cut off his power strip. It's time for some serious action.\" Three hours, 36 Chips Ahoy and six glasses of milk later, Santa sat soberly looking at a long scroll. \"Ho dear. It's almost Christmas and I barely have enough time left to make my list and check it twice of who's been naughty and nice! There's no way I'm going to have time to pick gifts for all these millions of kids! Why, we haven't even gathered the coal and sticks for the bad kids yet!\" \"I've got it, Santa!\" said Ken the Organizational Elf. \"We'll give the bad kids Alanis and Hootie CDs instead.

Some 16 hours later, Mrs. Claus showed up with cookies and warm milk and insisted he get some sleep. \"Ho, that was certainly fun,\" Santa said, dozens of campaigns and three weeks later, \"but a bit stressful on the old ticker! I'd better stick to Chutes and Ladders!\" Terry the Turn-Based Elf dropped a laptop on Santa's desk and suggested he give MASTER OF ORION 2 a shot. \"It's a thinking elf's game,\" the mus. tachioed elf snickered, giving a superior sideways glance at the group of elves enthralled in QUAKE (ostensibly to test the discs before loading them on the sleigh.) \"Ho, well, plenty of time till Christmas, eh? Why shouldn't I try out the sci-fi game all those kids have requested for Christmas?\" A month later, after hearing Santa shout that he was now supreme ruler of the universe, Mrs. Claus sat him down for a talk. \"Kris, don't you think you've been spending a bit too much time playing these computer games? I haven't seen you this involved in anything since the guys came up with the Kung Fu Grip version of GI Joe.\" \"Sorry, Mrs. C,\" Santa said, \"you're right. But I have to test these things if we're going to give them to all the good little boys and girls. A few more days and I'll stop, I promise.\" He hugged Mrs. Claus, thanked her, and sat down for just one more session of DAGGERFALL. \"He's sure been sittin' at that computer for a long time,\" said Jeff the Adventurous Elf, \"I think his arse is going to get stuck in that chair.\" Denny the Flighty Elf looked at Santa worriedly. \"Yeah, I'm worried, too. You know he asked me to build him a ThrustMaster F-16 cockpit when I gave him that copy of JETFIGHTER 111?\" \"Ho, this is cool!\" Santa shouted. \"I wonder \"So that's the story, Johnny,\" Santa said, admiring the 15th.floor view of San Francisco. \"Well, leave it to Ken to come up with a magic solution during a crisis,\" Johnny chuckled. \"Sure, we'd be glad to help.

"ACTION #1: Quake HOLIDAY UAKE is easily the number one action game of the year, even though it isn't the most innovative or original effort of the past year. What it does have are the best multiplayer options, true 3D environments, dark atmosphere and truly fun gameplay. Some would argue that QUAKE doesn't advance the first-person shooter genre like DUKE NUKEM 3D does, but at the CGW offices, QUAKE is king. Gameplay is similar to DOOM: you run around levels, killing monsters and finding the key to open the door that leads to the next level of monster thrashing. Technologically, though, Quake is amazing. All the environments and monsters are composed of true 3D, texture-mapped polygons. That means you can run around the level or creatures with complete freedom, since everything is rendered using 3D polygons in real space in real time. ACTION by Elliott \"The Action Figure Elf \"Chin his holiday season, action games are breaking new ground, both in technology and gameplay, and while you'll still play QUAKE, it definitely won't be the last action game that seduces you. There are first-person shooters that will take you into the sinister underground of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, 3D shooters that will strap you into a muscle car and transport you back to the '70s, and games with technology that showcases true 3D, real-time environments, ghostly transparency, dynamic lighting and texture mapped polygonal graphics. This winter also marks a renaissance of the non Doom games. With these games, you'll wreak havoc in isometric hallways without regret, hunt for ancient artifacts in breathtaking third-person view, and decapitate rival skaters in gorgeous thirdperson 3D in a brutal take on futuristic sports. So if you hunger for visceral gameplay and fast action, then any of these 10 games would make the perfect gift for you or the action starved. Level design also takes advantage of the 3D engine, with levels composed of catwalks above floors on top of sewers on top of graveyards. Many times, you'll swim through underwater levels, fire rockets at enemies perched on balconies above you or drop down on unsuspecting death matchers below. The dark colors and textures and scary ambient sounds also elevate QUAKE from a simple game to a truly frightening experience. If you play this game at night, with the lights turned off and the speakers cranked up high, be prepared to jump out of your seat when a ferocious Fiend plummets down on you from above with a guttural roar. The 3D graphics, sounds and dark textures all combine to create the most realistic and convincing environment of any first-person-perspective game. It's a realism unmatched by DUKE or any other first-person shooter. Finally, what make Quake a truly standout game are its multiplayer features. You can play it over null modem, modem, IPX local area network or the Internet, without the aid of a gaming service. Any owner of Quake is free to start his own server, to which any other Quake gamers can log on. QUAKE also supports dynamic entry so that gamers can join deathmatches in progress. And once you join a deathmatch you might never come out, because the gameplay here is so addictive and absorbing. Play QUAKE deathmatch and you will be caught in the ultimate \"just one more frag\" spell. If you're expecting more from QUAKE you might be disappointed, but for what it sets out to do, QUAKE is the number one action game and should be on the top of any action gamer's must-have list. $50.00, id Software, (800) idgames, www.idsoftware.com CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"ACTION #2: Duke Nuker SEOF CRITIES any would consider DUKE NUKEM 3D the true heir to Doom's throne, and it would be hard to argue with them. SECURIT DUKE isn't a clone, but an advance ment for the 3D first-person shooter genre. DUKE gives you interactive environments, so you can blast holes in a wall with your shotgun, and an open world, so you can revisit that past level to find your shotgun blasts still burned into the wall. For those gamers tired of games that take themselves too seriously, DUKE also offers a hilarious, cartoon HEALT, AKKOR S ERPONS like style and irreverence, with snide remarks HEUS 47/200 S: 5/50 : 0799 and rude curses spewing from Duke's mouth at 9/2001: 0/500: 8/99 the most appropriate times. Duke also has good multiplayer features, though it doesn't offer free Internet play or multitude of cool and interesting weapons, Duke should satisfy the dynamic entry for entering a deathmatch in progress. Also, its engine Doom urge in any action fan. isn't a true 3D engine like QUAKE's, but is a deceptively good \"two-and$39.95, FormGen/Apogee, (800) APOGEE1, a half-D\" engine.

CRUSADER: NO REGRET, the follow-up to No REMORSE, is just as good, and many CRUSADER fans agree that it's an even better challenge. Though it is much harder than the first CRUSADER-beginners should play No REMORSE first-No REGRET will not disappoint any action fan who loves big explosions, gory death sequences and challenging level design and traps. In No REGRET, you'll guide your armor-suited agent on screen through 10 levels of deadly traps and tough robots and soldiers as you attempt to destroy an evil conglomerate. Anything and everything in No REGRET blows up, in incredible and explosive detail. So if you have a penchant for excessive destruction, a need for a break from the Doom crowd, and a mind for navigating sin ister levels, then you'll definitely want to prowl the halls of No REGRET. $39.00, EA/Origin, (800) 245-4525, www.ea.com/origin.html CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"      #4: Tomb Raider idos' TOMB RAIDER is breaking new ground this winter with a different kind of character and a different look. In this game, you aren't a masochistic, gun-toting brute, but a gun. toting, tough woman of adventure. As Lara Croft, you'll pack pistol, Uzi, grenades and shotguns through the ruins of Egypt, Greece, South America and sunken Atlantis. And to better see the new and unique lead character, TOMB RAIDER also sports a third-person perspective look, unlike QUAKE or Duke. This is great news for gamers, because it offers a beautiful view of the lush graphics and 3D muscle of the TOMB RAIDER engine. Even without a 3D accelerator card, TOMB RAIDER delivers incredibly detailed textures and effects, such as murky, wavy water and convincing lighting and shadows. The backgrounds and creatures look exquisite, as does Lara. She has thousands of frames of animation for everything from back flips to swimming to hauling herself onto ledges. Unfortunately, TOMB RAIDER only has solo play, but the gorgeous environments and the beautifully animated star make this a solo mis. sion worth having. $49.99, Eidos, (415) 513-8929, www.eidos.com #5: Descent to Undermountain arallax Software's DESCENT TO UNDERMOUNTAIN is the real heir to DESCENT, but this new game descends even deeper-to the dungeons. Using a fully polygonal, 3D engine like QUAKE's, Parallax has created a world of interlaced cavernous dungeons in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons world of Waterdeep. Unlike pre. vious DESCENT games, you aren't flying through these caves in a spaceship. Instead, you are an adventurer who must venture into the dark dungeons of Undermountain to battle evil beasts and creatures on your quest to slay the Dark Elf goddess, Lloth. Combat is visceral and in your face, as you clash with enemies in melee wielding ax, sword and bow and arrow. There's also a touch of role-playing in UNDERMOUNTAIN, as your character grows in strength and you travel with freedom throughout the world, secur ing different quests and acquiring spells. At its heart, though, UNDERMOUNTAIN is a true hack-and-slash action game. Any fan of DESCENT or AD&D will enjoy this game, as will action gamers who enjoy combat in realistic environments. $42.00, Interplay, (800) 468-3775, www.interplay.com CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"    *C thay anh #6: Hyper Blade #8: Interstate '76 f you remember SPEEDBALL 2: BRUTAL DELUXE, then you'll recall a game of futuristic sports that was fast, fun and incredibly violent. Fans of this type of ultra-bloody, ultra-entertaining action gaming will be pleased to know that a worthy successor to this venerable game has arrived in Activision's HYPERBLADE. HYPERBLADE takes you into the next century, where roller hockey has become a deadly and popular sport. Each comprising three members two strikers and a goalie-the teams of this violent sport compete in vast, curved arenas, rushing through power-up points and bodies to slam pucks (or severed heads) into enemy goals. The production values are as smooth as some of EA Sports' best NHL HOCKEY products, with extensive stat tracking, player info and great interface graphics. The game itself is not only fast and fun but beautiful and brutal. Graphics are all texture. mapped poly gons and, with 3D acceleration, are smooth and gorgeous. The violence, though, is amazing, with bone-crunching body checks and even decapitations. If you want to play something different, and fun, strap on a helmet (and watch your head) and dive into a game of HYPERBLADE. $49.95, Activision, (800) 477-3650, www.activision.com hough MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES will be the last MECHWARRIOR game from Activision, it won't be the last time you see the game's incredible engine in action. The same team that brought you that clan battle royale is bringing you INTERSTATE '76 this winter. This 3D, polygonal shooter employs the next-generation MECHWARRIOR 2 engine, but is set in 1976 Earth, in an alternate past where law and order have degenerated so far that mer. cenaries have outfitted their own cars with weapons to protect, or rob, the coun tryside. You'll drive in old '70s muscle cars, ride with people who wear Afros and fire off rockets and machine guns at evil, mustachioed masterminds in lounge lizard suits. The game definitely has personality, and it also has a spectacular 3D engine, with dynamic lighting and a real physics model governing the motion of the cars and gunfire. If you dig excellent graphics and action, then you can groove to this gaming gig. $49.95, Activision, (800) 477-3650. www.activision.com #7: Virtua Squad smash hit in the arcades, where it was called VIRTUA COP, VIRTUA SQUAD puts you behind a badge against some of the most realistically simulated criminals in computer gaming. It's a basic rail shooter, like CYBERIA, but VIRTUA SQUAD has touches that make it incredibly fun. Everything here is rendered in real-time 3D with plenty of polygon details, which makes for incredibly realistic gunfights. If you blast away at a criminal's hand, his gun will fly out of his grasp and he'll stop and gaze in surprise at his wrist. Shoot his knee and his leg will buckle, then he'll tumble over. This level of detail makes it seem like you are in a shootout with real gang members rather than enemies with scripted movement and death scenes. Although the movement is on rails, the action changes its pacing so frequently and brilliantly, between furious gunfights and deliberate stalking around corners, that the business of rails never really bothers you. VIRTUA SQUAD won't replace Quake, but its graphics, pacing and detail guarantee that it won't disappoint. $44.95, Sega Entertainment, (888) SEGASALES, www.sega.com DECEMBER 1996 "

"    CLIDAY #9: Virtua Fighter PC 3D Stocking Stuffers CHEMPOH R15 TIMER WOLF Ithough this fighting game is a part of a two-year-old arcade fight er, it is undeniably the best fighting game for the PC this holiday season. It takes wonderful advantage of the PC's hardware, with quick, 3D, texture mapped polygons and otherwise excellent graphics. The gameplay in this game is outstanding, with eight players to choose from and a raft of special moves and strategies to be discovered by any who devote even a few hours to the game. However, it does have a high system overhead-you'll need at least a Pentium 60 to CHRLLENGER 2010 run the game. KAGE Aside from that, though, VFPC's 3D graphics require no spe cial hardware to run. If you like fighting games, this title definite ly belongs in your library. If you aren't a fighting fan yet, this game's looks and playability might just hook you. $49.95, Sega Entertainment, (888) SEGASALES, www.sega.com ere are a few other good games that didn't quite make the top ten list. SKYNET, the sequel to Bethesda's TERMINATOR: FUTURE SHOCK, is a 3D first. person-perspective shooter that is completely polygo nal like QUAKE, and offers good graphics with plenty to blow up. Unlike its predecessor, it offers multiplayer gaming and SVGA graphics. ERADICATOR is another 3D Doom clone, but it offers enough twists in gameplay and look to stand out from the crowd. This game has three selectable characters with different abilities, over a dozen unique weapons, a DUKE like interactive environ ment, and a third person or first person look. NECRODOME has a similar design and also gives you an interactive environ ment. You can ride in a vehicle and obliterate enemies or get out and blast them on foot. OUTLAWS, from LucasArts, uses a modified DARK FORCES engine to deliver Wild West gunfighting in the old Spaghetti Western tradition. The game's animated cut scenes tell a good story and the gameplay is a little dif ferent, with smart enemies, the need to reload weapons, and a simpler health system #10: Syndicate Wars rocks and metal. The original SYNDICATE was the game that spawned CRUSADER and its many clones, and SYNDICATE WARS looks ready to give the game that started it all the recognition it deserves. $59.95, EA/Bullfroy, (800) 245-4525, www.bullfrog.co.uk YNDICATE WARS, the sequel to one of Bullfrog's most beloved games, has finally arrived after a four-year wait. The original SYNDICATE was an isometric action game that put you in charge of four vicious cyborgs on a killing rampage through futuristic Earth. SYNDICATE WARS still has the same isometric look, but this time the characters are larger in the old version, you had to practically squint to see your tiny commandos). The plot is a little different as well, as you are now in charge of the Syndicate and not gunning after it. SYNDICATE WARS also adds multiplayer gaming to the mix, and has even more explosive and violent weapons, including a mini-nuclear detonator that brings huge skyscrapers tumbling down in a shower of CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"ADVENTURE 41. The Pandora Directive 100 HOLID ADVENTURE by Jeffrey \"The Adventurous Elt\" Green he biggest mystery in adventure games this year was, unfortunately, wondering where they all went. Thankfully, Santa, after sitting on his duff all year eating pork rinds with Mrs. Claus, now appears to be working overtime, as a slew of adventures are poised to hit the shelves in time for the holidays. It also seems as though Santa is going to be handing out pink slips to many of the B-movie actors who have been starting (or ending) their careers in interactive movies, as the new crop of games shows that animation is making a big-and welcome-comeback. This isn't to say that we don't appreciate full motion video-our top two picks, in fact, revel in it-but many of the newer games on the list are animated adventures positively brimming with creative energy. And this is just the kind of spark needed to breathe life into the genre and get us all excited again. henever someone utters the phrase \"interactive movie\" around the Computer Gaming World office, it's usually accompanied by a face like the one you'd make if someone handed you a week-old sandwich with something smelly and dead in the middle. We want to like them-really--but for the most part, once you get past the marketing hype, they almost always turn out to be 90 percent Hollywood chrome and 10 percent actual gaming. Last year's UNDER A KILLING MOON was a very popular, high-profile game, but epitomized-to us, at least-this problem of glitz over gaming. That's why we're as surprised as anyone that we've chosen THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE-the sequel to UNDER A KILLING MOONas our number one adventure pick for this holiday season. Access has surpassed our wildest expectations for this game, providing an experience that is better than the original in every way. This time around, the year is 2043, and Tex Murphy is hired to find a missing person, which leads him onto the trail of a serial killer and eventually envelops him in one of the great paranoid mysteries of the 20th century-the alleged UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Can Tex find the killer and outwit the evil government agents trying to stop him in his tracks? Will he solve the Mayan calendar rid dle without Scorpia's help? Part detective story, part campy scifi movie, part X-Files ripoff, PANDORA AS a big (six CD), enter taining and challenging title with puzzles that should appeal to adventure gamers of all types. Access did a particularly nice job of increasing the playability (and replayability) of this game by offering two play modes. Newbies can play in Entertainment mode, which offers a detailed hint system so you never have to be stuck too long, while more experienced gamers can play in the harder Game Player mode, which lets you earn extra points by solving additional, more complex puzzles. More impressive are the game's multiple paths: depending on the choices you make, and the way you interact with others, you'll follow three different paths, leading to seven different endings. In this way, conversations with others are more than just information dumps-they're moral litmus tests that challenge you to consider the consequences of your words and deeds. Finally, there's that Hollywood chrome. The acting throughout, including appearances by Kevin McCarthy and Barry Corbin, is first-rate--with the notable exception of Chris Jones, who plays Tex again, and who is fast becoming the Pauley Shore of computer games. So, what the heck. Maybe interactive movies aren't all bad. If they must exist, let them at least be like THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE. $79.95 Access Software (800) 800-4880, www.accesssoftware.com DECEMBER 1996 "

"ADVENTURE EAEAR COMLINK COMLINK CloseFGR #2: Spycraft: The Great Game XPOND 10 POCAS HOR2 SAT: MILSTAR VI CLICK FOR OPS MOR COLBY *SECURE ARCHIVE he Great Game\" is an appropriate subtitle to this spy story from Activision, because that is exactly what it is. Like THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE, SPYCRAFT took us by surprise; what appears to be a lightweight, newbie game is actually one of the most original adventures of the year, with a rich, com: pelling plot; clever gameplay, and outstanding use of fullmotion video You assume the role of a rookie CIA agent assigned to investigate the twin assassinations of a Russian politician and your CIA instructor-and to prevent the possible assas. sination of the president of the United States. The game begins slowly but, like all good thrillers, gets tenser, better and scarier as it goes on with enough double-crossing intrigue to please even discerning Le Carré fans. Perhaps best of all, and this is a real rarity for an adventure game-is that every single puzzle is integrated into the plot and REPORT atmosphere of the story. As you hunt for the bad guys, you'll analyze voice prints, break codes, doctor photographs, and-in one memo rably creepy scene-torture a suspect (if you choose). Real-life spying may not be as fun as SPYCRAFT, but then again, neither are most adventure games. $49.95, Activision, (800) 477-3650, www.activision.com #3: Star Control 3 aktaklakpak! Warning! Daktaklakpak! STAR CONTROL fans, alert! All your favorite aliens, from the spineless Spathi to the ugly Vux, are back in the third installment of Accolade's epic, comic sci-fi adventure. STAR CONTROL 3, developed by Legend Entertainment, takes place in 2178, about 20 years after the close of STAR CON II. This time, you play the senior commander of the League of Sentient Races, who must command a star fleet to explore and colonize the Kessari Quadrant as you attempt to restore a breakdown in hyperspace travel and prevent the destruction of all sentient life. The STAR CONTROL games have always defied categoriza. tion, and this one is no exception, with adventure gaming mixed in with equal parts resource management, strategy and combat sequences. Traditional adventure gamers might find more here than they bargained for, but those up to the challenge will find themselves engrossed in a universe of amazing depth, while hilarious dialogue and voice work keep it all from getting too ponderous. Also a blast is the HyperMelee combat mode, probably the funniest ASTEROIDS knockoff you'll ever play.

"ADVENTURE #4: The Neverhood he first computer game to be released by DreamWorks Interactive, a joint venture between Microsoft and DreamWorks SKG (that's Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen), wins-hands down-as the coolest looking adventure game on the list. THE NEVERHOOD is a clay-animated fantasy adventure designed by Doug TenNapel, creator of EARTHWORM JIM, and it's the kind of game that's so incredible looking you can't wait to show it to your friends The story finds you in the role of Klaymen, a flexible clay hero who must save the land of the Neverhood from being overrun by the evil Klogg. The game is rela. tively short and easy for experienced gamers (maybe 20 hours), and some of the more Myst-like button-and-lever puzzles may try your patience, but ultimately THE NEVERHOOD is a winner because it has so much fresh, imaginative charm. In fact, not solving a puzzle is almost as much fun as solving it, because the animation, no matter what you do, is always a pleasure to watch. Add a funky, bluesy musical score to the mix, and you wind up with a sure-fire entertaining package for the whole family. See the Adventure section in this issue for a full review. $54.95, DreamWorks Interactive, (310) 234-7000 #5: Toonstruck GIPTOVAL CONCEPTO CATE THE FUTURC irgin's TOONSTRUCK, which seems to have been in development forever, is an edgy comic adventure in the grandest tradition of LucasArts games like SAM AND Max Hit THE ROAD and DAY OF THE TENTACLE. Those are lofty comparisons, to be sure, and if TOONSTRUCK isn't quite in that class, it is in fact a memorably goofy experience, loaded with genuine out-loud laughs and fine state-of-the-art animation. Christopher Lloyd (a human cartoon if there ever was one) stars as Drew Blanc, animator of the sickeningly sweet Saturday morning cartoon series \"The Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun Show,\" who finds himself transported to a cartoon world in desperate need of his help. Along with Christopher Lloyd, TOONSTRUCK boasts an all-star lineup of comic voice talent, including Dan Castallanetta (the voice of Homer Simpson), Tim Curry, David Ogden Stiers and Dom DeLuise. Though it may sound and look at times like a kid's game, it most definitely is not something you'll figure out when you see the sheep dressed in dominatrix leather $59.95, Virgin Interactive Entertainment, (714) 833-8710, www.vie.com ABUSE ZEWNLOC DECEMBER 1996 "

"AD VENTURE #6: Leisure Suit Larry 7: #7: Titanic: Love for Sail Adventure Out of Time hen we first learned that the title of this game had been changed from \"Yank Hers Away\" to \"Love for Sail,\" we were concerned that maybe Al Lowe had decided to tone down the now 10-year-old Larry franchise after all these years, so as not to offend. Hey, it could happen. People mellow. But no, not to worry. Larry Laffer is back in all his lascivious splendor, guaran teed to offend all the usual parties in his endless, pathetic quest for female compan ionship This year's model finds Larry on a luxury cruise, hoping to, uh, set sail with the beautiful Captain Thygh. Others on-board for Larry to pine over include such characters as the mom-and-daughter country-western duo The Juggs, first names Wydoncha and Nailmi. Obviously, this is not a game for everyone, but if you like your adventure games sea. soned with bawdy humor, LLL is the classiest tasteless act around, with a proven track record, and the puzzles in these games are always just as challenging as they are amusing. Just keep it away from chil. dren and Those Who Are Not Easily Amused. $49.95, Sierra On-Line, (206) 649-5862, www.sierra.com he most famous luxury liner in history is going down again, and this time you're going with it. TITANIC, developed by Cyberflix, boasts one of the best plots on this list. You are a British secret agent aboard the doomed ship, and you've been assigned to retrieve a priceless book that's been stolen by a German spy, and that is to be exchanged for British naval secrets. The game plays like a standard adventure game at first, as you explore the ship and talk to passengers. Once the ship hits the iceberg, however, TITANIC really picks up steam, as it shifts into a realtime mode in which you have exactly 2 1/2 hours-the time it took the real ship to sink-to finish your mission. GTE has been hyping the accurate 3D rendering of the ship, and it is indeed quite beautiful. Many gamers will probably be content to wander around the ship and gaze at the spectacular recreations. But those who just want a good game should be quite satisfied, too. STBA, GTE Entertainment, (619) 431-8801, www.im.gte.com #8: Circle of Blood sugar his animated adventure game from Virgin Interactive Entertainment doesn't break any new ground, but it's FANAR a solid, traditional adventure game à la Sanctuary Woods' THE RIDDLE OF MASTER Lu that should provide many hours of entertainment for adventure game fans. The story takes you to Paris in the role of American George Stobbart, who witnesses a bomb blast at a cafe and finds himself plunged into a mystery involving a medieval manuscript created by the Knights of Templar, a notorious military and religious order founded in Jerusalem during the Crusades. As George investigates the mystery of the Knights of Templar, he begins to uncover a plot to take over the world by a sin ister group of nogoodniks. CIRCLE OF Blood's plot is quite good, and the puzzles are, if not wholly original, at least cleverly constructed and fair, but where the game really stands out is in the animation. COB was designed by artists formerly with Don Bluth Studios, and their talent is evident in every beautifully detailed scene. Thankfully, the game also maintains a nice sense of humor, includ i ng ample cheap potshots at the French. C'est bien, ça. $49.95 Virgin Interactive Entertainment (714) 833-8710. www.vie.com CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"ADVENTURE #9: Lighthouse More Holiday Adventures his game shipped on the day we submitted this article, and the online debate was raging already: Is it or isn't it a Myst clone? Our definitive, professional answer (because that's what we're here for) is this: Well, in way, yeah, sort of One thing it has over Myst, right from the start, is a discernible story line to set you in the right direction. You are a writer renting a beachfront property on the Oregon coast, and are suddenly summoned by the physicist who lives in the lighthouse nearby to babysit his baby daughter while he attends to an emergency When you arrive, the man is gone, and you see the baby being taken from her crib by some kind of alien creature. You need to follow this creature through a portal to another world and try to save the day. e're still psyched for CALLAHAN'S CROSSTIME SALOON, based on the great Spider Robinson's short stories, but the last word we received from Legend Entertainment was that it looked like it was being bumped to an early '97 release. Another game that adventurers will be thrilled to see is LucasArts CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND, third in the series of their classic comic adventures. Speaking of comedy, Psygnosis is set to release DISCWORLD 2, a follow-up to Terry Pratchett's goofy fantasy adventure, once again featuring the voice work of Eric Idle. Philips Media has a spectacular-looking 3D animated adventure on the way called DOWN IN THE DUMPS, which relates the misadventures of a group of beleaguered, miniature aliens who have crashlanded on Earth in a rubbish-filled dump. On the more serious side of things, Sierra is set to release its latest frightfest, PHANTASMAGORIA 2: A PUZZLE OF FLESH, which is not a sequel to the first title, but instead relates an entirely new story. Finally, Cyberdreams is fol lowing I Have No MOUTH, AND I MUST SCREAM CGW's adventure game of the year last year, with a black-and-white (1) detective story called Noir. Can a black-and-white game survive amid all this flashy competition? Stay tuned. It's when you get to the other world that things get rather Myst-like, as you must deal with a plethora of gadget-heavy puzzles that, depending on your take on these things, will either delight you in their ingenuity or drive you freakin' bananas. Those waiting for Myst I will be right at home in LIGHTHOUSE. $49.95, Sierra On-Line, (206) 649-9800, www.sierra.com #10: RAMA or science fiction fans, the best bet for this holiday season is Sierra's RAMA, based on the classic sci-fi series of books written by Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. The game takes its main story from RAMA II, in which a group of astronauts 200 years in the future is sent to rendezvous with and explore a large alien space ship. When the mission leader dies mysteriously, you are sent in as a replacement, and you soon find yourself absorbed in the mysteries of the ship. Fans of the series should be heartened to know that Gentry Lee had active, direct input into the game, all the way down to the design of the puzzles, so there's no reason to fear that this will be another mangling of a popular science-fiction title, à la last year's THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES. Arthur C. Clarke himself appears in the game's prologue and finale and whenever you die, and he's also the subject of interviews in a separate CD-ROM. $59.95, Sierra On-Line, (206) 649-9800, www.sierra.com DECEMBER 1996 "

"ROLE-PLAYING #1: Diablo 100 ROLEINVS <CHAR 2COUGOVORSO by Johnny L. \"Claus' Wilson ole playing, like the old man in the Monty Python film, is not quite dead. It's feeling much better, thank you. Still, there is quite a distance to go before role-playing becomes a healthy genre again. Apparently, computer role playing games simply became too large, too repetitious and too detailed for many computer gamers. So, they moved on to other kinds of games. Fortunately, the next wave of role. playing games may serve to bring some of those prodigal gamers back to their first love. With new 3D looks to pull you in, incredible soundtracks to set the mood, and improved interfaces and designs to keep you in the digital dungeon, things are definitely looking up for role players during this holiday season. ith DIABLO, Blizzard has brought together all the elements of an epic. Set in a dark, gothic world, DIABLO lets you play the role of a Warrior, Rogue or Sorcerer. There are no fancy hybrid character classes and no exotic backgrounds. You play a traveling hero or heroine who returns to his/her hometown to discover that some Dark Riders, apparently led by an archvillain named \"The Butcher,\" have slaughtered many of the townsfolk, destroyed some of the houses and buildings, and desecrated the church on the outskirts of town. You piece together the remnants of the story by listening to the tavern owner and a dying townsman via audio clips. The voice acting isn't superb, but it is better than the acting in many full-motion video games. However, the music (sometimes an ominous chant, other times evocative of forest and town) and sound effects (screeches, bones crunching, sword clashes and shield parries), are absolutely superb for setting the mood. DIABLO's graphics are outstanding. Whether you're looking at the smoothly animated 3D characters, the flickering light sources and shadowing when your hero is in the dungeon, or the details in the building interiors, the look is fantastic. In fact, for a while we thought DIABLO was just a pretty remake of Rogue or NetHack. Trust us when we say it isn't. As in the best role playing games, dungeon items are restricted by weight, mage skill or character class; magical artifacts are classified mundane, magic or unique; and there are more than 30 different spells for heroes to use in the course of play. Better yet, DIABLO is replayable. The game is never the same, even for solitaire players, but the addition of one other human player (modem to modem) or three additional players (LAN or Internet) will add a large number of permutations. Further, with Blizzard's provision of free access to opponents on the Internet via their Battlenet server, there is sure to be a critical mass of fresh opponents in cyberspace whenever you're ready to pick up a new game. DIABLO may not have enough complexity for some hard-core role-players, but it is certainly going to have a large following among those who enjoy a lot of hack and slash as part of their healthy gaming diet. $50.00, Blizzard Entertainment, (800) 953-SNOW, www.blizzard.com.

"Dungeons&Dragons When the award-winning Descent game engine landed in AD&D game's most famous world, the globe FORGOTTEN REALMS ... ...it left in its wake the most revolutionary new RO ll the wizards and magicians in the Realms could never have predicted what happened that mystical night in the dungeons of Undermountain. After all of their spells, conjuring, and attempts to see the future, the future literally crashed down upon them. With deadly force. It left an indelible mark. It affected their vision. Their movement. Their way of life and death. It changed their history as well as their future. Introducing DESCENT TO UNDERMOUNTAIN», the most revolutionary new AD&D FORGOTTEN REALMS action RPG game in centuries. Based on the hugely successful Descent engine, the dark inhabitants of Undermountain's stone belly now experience 3D vision and 360° movement. Perhaps it was the strange visitor from the future. Perhaps just the trauma. But multiple characters are now developing in the cracks and under the rocks of ancient caves. All of this, along with multiple player options has forever changed the face of the AD&D FORGOTTEN REALMS world.

The game series also features a fascinating cultural background that you can sample in the two previous games, REALMS OF ARKANIA and STAR TRAIL, or in two current paperbacks (Realms of Arkania: The Charlatan and Realms of Arkania: The Lioness, both currently published by Prima Publishing's Proteus series at $5.99 each). Non-combat encounters are handled via close-up character profiles and conversation lists where you can choose from a range of general conversational gambits or specific lines of inquiry. Combat encounters are plentiful and challenging. 3D animations set up the story and advance the quest at various points. Ideal for traditional, hardcore role players, SHADOWS OVER Riva is the third installment in the series, and it looks richer and better than ever. $59.95, Sirtech Software, (800) 447-1230, www.sir-tech.com #4: Betrayal at Antara as Schwarze Auge o, this isn't a scrap from last year's Holiday Buying Guide. THE ELDER SCROLLS: DAGGERFALL is finally in the stores. All of you who like really big role. playing games should enjoy this one. There's a long, challenging central quest and dozens upon dozens of miniquests randomly generated on the fly. The first-person 3D graphics really add to the sense of being in a strange world, particularly when you're climbing up staircases and levitating from one balcony lo another. Combat is first-person, and it requires a bit of mouse analog movement to determine when weapon thrusts, lunges and slashes take place. The special effects for casting spells add to combat satisfaction, as well. Particularly impressive are the ability to join guilds and per: form quests to benefit your new brotherhood or sisterhood, the ability to be tutored (with some randomality) in your skills, and the fact that it touches on some adult themes without being offensive. Also nice is the way skills and attributes are factored into the gameplay. But don't take our word for it. See what Scorpia has to say about it in this month's Role Playing section. $79.99. Bethesda Softworks, (800) 8770700, www.bethsoft.com. he second in Sierra's BETRAYAL series (the first was BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, based on the works of Raymond E. Feist), ANTARA attempts to recapture some of the magic of the first game with its first-person look, emphasis on character perspectives, skill-based development, and 3D environment. Here, though, the action takes place in an entirely different universe. ANTARA's designers have created new creatures, cul tures and environments to encounter that are unlike the Tolkienesque creatures in most fantasy games. Plus, the plot advances via a series of Machiavellian webs of political intrigue and hidden agendas. The game offers a full-screen view window. The character/inventory interface is nor mally hidden, rising up from the bottom of the screen when you move your cursor to there and invoke it. The movement interface simply uses compass angles for precision. As a result, you never feel like the interface is too obtrusive in this game. Those worried that BETRAYAL AT ANTARA will be a cheap rip-off of its predecessor needn't be concerned. ANTARA should stand on its own as a fresh approach to fantasy role-playing-a game where exploration, surprise and discovery are just as exhilarating as combat. $54.95, Sierra On-Line, (800) 757-7707, www.sierra.com. >>>continued on page 148 DECEMBER 1996 "

"SIMULATIONS HOLIDAY OOL LOS SIMULATIONS #1: Flying Corps by Denny \"The Flighty Elf\" Atkin and Gordon \"The Rubber-burning Elt\" Goble nach year's holiday crop of simulations is that much closer to reality than the year past. For the most part, today's flight sims fly more like the real thing, look more like the real thing, and send you on more realistic missions. Racing sims have added more realism in both han: dling and graphics, but at the same time design improvements have made them more accessible to beginning drivers. Overall, it appears designers are beginning to remove the intimidation factor from simulations without dumbing them down. The biggest advance in many of this year's flight sims is the dynamic campaign environ ments. Instead of launching you on a series of scripted missions, these games drop you into the middle of an entire simulated war, with dozens of flights all doing their own thing. What's missing from this holiday gift list? Propellers! Developers have all but ignored WWar II and Korea recently. With one notable exception, all the flight sims have concentrated on modern jets and helicopters. The future for historical sims looks bright, though, and hopefully next year Santa's elves will have plenty of goodies for those who prefer their combat without the high-tech gadgetry. mpire has executed a marvelous sneak attack on gamers with FLYING CORPS. Sim fans familiar with earlier Rowan efforts will be pleased to find the arcade-like flight models, confusing view systems, mand quirky video and sound drivers of the developer's previous products are nowhere to be found here. The designers of FLYING CORPS have exhaustively researched the han dling qualities and combat environments of World War I aircraft, poring over hundreds of books and historical documents and interview ing pilots who've flown restored aircraft from the Great War. The result is a simulation that soars in both graphics and flight modeling. Torque, gyroscopic effects from rotary engines, stalls, spins, and even wind effects are all there. Enemy artificial intelligence specs are also impressive-computer pilots fly specific planes in the manner their real-life counter parts did. For instance, pilots of the slow Pfalz will generally try to avoid the fight unless they have an altitude advantage and can make a dive-and-run attack. Newbie sim pilots can tone down the Al and turn off vari ous aspects of the flight model realism, mak: ing FLYING CORPS a good gift idea for trainees and aces alike Along with the typical instant-action modes for those days you just want to take off and start shooting, the game also features four campaigns. Set near the end of the war, in 1917-18, these campaigns put you in the cockpits of famous aces, or in the aircraft of those who faced them. You'll fly as Lothar von Richthofen, attempting to break the kill record set by your brother Manfred (better known as the Red Baron) while he's on leave from his squadron. Can you face the onslaught of Albert Ball and the 56th Royal Flying Corps and become Germany's top ace? Another cam. paign lets you fly as Eddie Rickenbacker, America's top ace. Most intriguing is the dynamic campaign set at the Battle of Cambrai, where you'll fly over history's first major tank offensive. This simulation is a big technological leap for the Empire/Rowan team. The new graphics engine sports beautifully texture mapped air craft (whose color schemes can be customized when you reach sufficient rank) complete with scrollable virtual cockpits. The terrain is built from actual WW I aerial photography and is so detailed that you'll be able to use period maps to navigate to your target by following the proper rivers and roads. The graphics engine is completely new, and it takes full advantage of the power of this year's computers and next year's as well. Empire says the standard 640x480 display can be bumped all the way up to 1600x1200 pixels if your display card, monitor, and processor can handle it. Both Win 95 and DOS versions are included on the CD, making this the perfect gift for any sim fan. $54.95, Empire, (800) 216-9706, www.empire-us.com CG DECEMBER 1996 "


"SIMULATIONS #2: Jetfighter II riginally a candidate for last year's gift list, this F-22 simulator should finally hit shelves in plenty of time for Santa's last shopping run. You'll fly in fictional campaigns set in future Cuba and Chile, where you'll fly carrier-based F-22s (hey, it's fiction) and FIA-18 Hornets in support of American interests. The jagged terrain of Chile, accurately recreated using satellite data and warp-free texture maps, should make for spectacular missions. The campaign is scripted, but it features a wide variety of possible branches, depending on mis. sion outcomes. This promises more interesting missions than are possible with random generators. Since our last look at the game, a number of new features have been added to the already impressive graphics engine, including soft ware-based MIP-mapping to eliminate aliasing, as well as real-time, light-sourced terrain shadowing (a feature not found in competing F. 22 sims). Mission sources say they have addressed early concerns about flight modeling and weapons loads, and the company aims to accurately model the F-22 and its systems. With over five million miles of accurate terrain to fly around, JETFIGHTER III promises plenty of action.

STBA, Mission Studios (distributed by Interplay), (800) INTERPLAY, www.missionstudios.com #3: Grand Prix 11 RAND PRIX II is the strongest PC racing title to date.

Each track is an exacting replica of its reallife counterpart. Cars are adorned with logos and detailed color schemes. They spark when they ground out, expel unburned fuel as bursts of flame, and kick up tire smoke when the wheels spin. GP Il's cockpit lets you quickly glance at suggested gears for upcoming turns, driver's aids enabled, your current position and lap, car damage and more. Driving a GP Il car is fun, exciting, and easy to learn. With enough oppo. nent strength variance, driving aids, and car set-up options to keep every one from rookie to sim veteran happy, the program manages to provide accessibility to the drivers still working on their learner's permit They say good things come to those who wait.

"SIMULATIONS #4: Hind LG he sequel to last year's APACHE, Hino isn't the same old sim with a different helicopter. Although the look is similar-it uses an improved version of APACHE's graphics engine-gameplay is different enough to give this sim an identity of its own. The Russian Hind helicopter is a generation older than the Apache, and its lack of advanced systems makes gameplay far more challenging. It doesn't possess all the high-tech targeting systems found in the Apache, and in the air it handles more like a tank than the Apache's sportscar like nimbleness. The \"Silicon WSO,\" a computercontrolled weapons systems officer, can make up for some of this by targeting enemies for you; those seeking the ultimate challenge can turn him off. Hind adds an unprecedented human element to sim combat. Not only will you drop off or rescue troop formations, but you'll also encounter large groups of enemies on the ground. It's one thing to blow away a faceless tank, quite another to take aim at a group of sol diers running for their lives. With three campaigns (Korea, Kazakstan, and Afghanistan), arcade and sim modes, and support for up to 16 players in multiplayer mode, HIND should be near the top of any helicopter fan's holiday gift list. $49.95, Interactive Magic, (800) 789-1534, www.imagicgames.com #5: AH-64D Longbow 156 OOO nother top choice for helicopter fans, AH-64D LONGBOW comes from the team lead by Andy Hollis, creator of such classics as F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER and F. 15 STRIKE EAGLE II and III. This simula. tion of the U.S. Army's premier attack helicopter is one of the rare sims that's acces. sible to beginners (thanks to a top notch interactive tutorial), yet accurate enough to please the most hard-core sim experts. DeenBBEER. Campaign missions are set in the Baltics, with TR01037 ROTOR. RPM:100 historical missions from Operation Just Cause (Panama) and Operation Desert Storm included Tans U 30 31 so TADS as well. The hi-res terrain looks terrific, and the accurate instrumentation will help you stay alive as you fly nap-of-the-earth attacks against enemy ground units. If you already own LONGBOW, you'll want to add the FLASH POINT KOREA expansion disc, which adds over 140 new missions, updated avionics, and new terrain. It also lets you fly from the copilot/gunner position, a feature missing in the original game. Also in the works is a version for Windows 95, as well as multiplayer support. $54.95, Jane's/Origin, (800) 245-4535, www.ea.com/janes RETRO1082 OP TEMP:098 DECEMBER 1996 "

"SIMULATIONS #6: NASCAR Racing 2 #8: Back To Baghdad ASCAR RACING 2, from Sierra's Papyrus division, takes an already superb racing game and makes it even better. This game has the potential to ruin the non-tobacco economy of North Carolina, as NASCAR fans might just sit glued to their computers all weekend instead of heading to the raceway. The sim sports a number of improvements designed to make it more accessible, including a single-screen car setup routine. The graphics engine has also been souped up. Although the original NASCAR supported hi-res graphics, this tuned-up version has a more sophisticated appearance that sports clouds, more realistic pave. ment, and smoother updates. NASCAR 2 looks great in SVGA and is stunning in its 3D graphics board versions Car handling has improved, which will be good news to casual racers intimidated by the quirky sensitivity of its prequel. There's less wobble, and curb. ing (the tilt of the car when cornering) should help keep your tires glued to the pavement. Beginners can use steering assistance or an arcade mode if they want to dive in and start racing and still have a chance to place. Helpful voiceovers from your crew chief help keep you apprised of what's going on around you. $54.95, Sierra, (206) 649-9800, www.sierra.com ACK TO BAGHDAD is the sim of choice for the jaded, experienced PC fighter pilot. While it doesn't have many of the gameplay-related bells and whistles of many of its competitors, it is by far the most complete, authentic simulation of the environs of a fighter jet cockpit yet produced. Its flight model is state of the art, matching realistic performance envelopes under a variety of weight and drag contig. #7: US Navy Fighters '97 t's the series that just wouldn't go away. After the original US NAVY FIGHTERS, MARINE FIGHTERS, USNF GOLD, ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS, and NATO FIGHTERS, Jane's and EA are closing out the series with USNF '97. This Windows 95 game includes all the aircraft and missions from the original USNF and MARINE FIGHTERS, plus a new 25-mission campaign set in Vietnam. New flyable planes added for the Vietnam era include the F-4B and F4J Phantom Ils, the F-8J Crusader, the A. 7A model of the Corsair II, and the MiG17 and the MiG-21. The USNF missions feature many of the improvements added to later games in the series, including better terrain and aircraft graphics, handling tweaks and interface improvements. You'll also find much more intense flak and SAM action. Also retrofitted is the multiplayer capability introduced in ATF, sup. porting network, modem, and nullmodem connections. Finally, the reference section has been fleshed out with data from Jane's All the World's Aircraft, as well as a new series of aircraft videos. $54.95, Jane's/Electronic Arts, (800) 245-4535, www.ea.com/janes urations. The sim boasts a highly detailed simulation of the F-16's avionics systems: there are ten HUD modes and nine air-toair and air-to-ground radar modes to challenge even experienced simmers. The game features a variety of individual missions set in a fictional (at least at press time) second Persian Gulf war. The topology is generated from reams of geo graphical data for a large region around Baghdad, so the lay of the land is totally accurate. The detail looks great at low altitude-if you have a very fast computer (P133+) with loads (32MB) of memory. This is a great gift for the very experienced sim pilot, but be warned that you'll want to wrap it with a detailed book on operating a real F-16, as the included documentation is rather skimpy. $99.95, Military Simulations, (360) 254-2000, www.military-sim.com DECEMRER 1906 "

"SPACE SIMS 1. X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter HOLID LIDAY HO he mission: prepare for an imminent allack at Endor. We'll soften up the Imperial presence in the region by hil. ting their delivery convoy. Yellow squadron will engage the freighters and transports, Red will escort them. Blue squadron will clear the area of any TIE Fighters. Good luck, and may the Force be with you... That's the kind of scenario you can relive in LucasArt's X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER. What sepa look like they were lifted out of the movies? The ships are absolutely gorgeous, showing off fine details such as blast doors and the pipe. lined body of an Imperial Star Destroyer. But if you admire the pretty graphics too long, the fast-paced combat will literally fly by you, and your opponent will be chalking up another kill. Single player missions serve as training for the multiplayer action, and the backdrop for all of these missions will most likely be the famed SPACE SIMS ELRI DIST21 by Thierry \"The Spacey Elf\" Nguyen he past year hasn't been a stellar one for space sims, but it looks like the Christmas season will bring some new stars. The themes this holiday season are multiplayer and money, with mercenary-style capitalism and the ability to battle live human opponents via modem or network the features du jour. Add to that the fact that most of these space sims place us in familiar territory (in the cockpit of a giant robot, or zooming about the Star Wars or Wing Commander universes), sport beautiful graphics, and offer a broad range of complexity to satisfy novices and experts alike, and you've got a great lineup for those cold-as-space winter days. There's not much new thematically here--it's you vs. evil empires in space scooters or big tanks with arms and legs-but the top games here are the classic formulas nearly perfected rates this mission from the many others just like it in the previous two games? Every flight group in that mission can, and probably will, be human. LucasArts has made a brilliant move by making the next Star Wars space sim a multiplayer experience. Ever since the Star Wars films came out 19 years ago, countless fans have dreamed of flying those great ships from the trench and Death Star II scenes. Those dreams came true in the form of X-WING and TIE FIGHTER. But, as always, people are compet itive, and when the Al in both games has been beaten countless times over, LucasArts ups the ante by finally bringing us the multiplayer expe. rience we need. And if multiplayer isn't enough, how about texture mapping the graphics so that the ships Battle of Endor. The actual missions will not only have duels to the death, but also numerous team missions where one side (Empire or Rebellion) attacks the other side. Since there will be massive battles, players who get blasted in the line of duty can kick a computer pilot out of his ship and take over to reenter the fray. These missions will emphasize teamwork and tactical strategy, just like a real battle. Play options abound in this DOS game, with modem, direct connection, and eight-player LAN support included. In the end, the graphics, the multi-user play, and, most of all, the mythos, will make this game number one on every space simmer's wish list. $54.95, LucasArts, (800) 98-LUCAS, www.lucasarts.com DECEMBER 1996 "

"SPACE SIMS DAY HOS #2: Privateer 2: The Darkening #3:MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries make the gritty, futuristic atmosphere of Blade Runner, present it in a dark, disturbing and macabre-humorous English style in the vein of A Clockwork Orange, throw in a dash of freeform exploration and capitalism from Sid MEER'S PIRATES! all while wrapping it in space combat a la the WING COMMANDER Seriesand you have PRIVATEER 2: THE DARKENING. This game takes you into the seedy, corrupt underbelly of the WING COMMANDER Universe. Will you be a legitimate trader, or a risk-taking smuggler? How about semihonest mer To cenary, or outright bloodthirsty pirate? Your choice. Will you work for the C15 secret police or the Kindred, the largest crime syndicate in the galaxy? Perhaps you will work within the thin line that separates both, keeping straight in the middle. Featuring an engine far more graphically spectacular than that of WING COMMANDER IV (with more detailed ships and impressive light sourcing), a large expanse of space to explore, and a com. plex story, THE DARKENING looks like a fantastic game. It retains the absolute freedom of the original PRIVATEER, and adds a rich plot that is vastly improved over the original. And of course you'll find the ubiquitous full-motion video sequences, rendered with typical Origin aplomb. STBA, Origin Systems, (800) 245-4525, www.ea.com eviewed in this issue's Simulation section, MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES is set to end Activision's reign of BattleTech games with style. The prequel to MECHWARRIOR 2, MERCENARIES is packed with new enhancements and changes that could make it surpass its predecessor (or successor, depending on how you look at it). The most visible changes are the texture maps that adorn the many Mechs in MERCENARIES, as well as the landscapes. More subtle improvements include a particle system, an improved physics model and a better night vision system. Amy Gameplay-related changes include a non-linear campaign random mission gen erator, and the heavy use of resource management. With merce nary capitalism being the theme here, expect everything, from repairs to weapons to cus. tomization, to cost money. Perhaps the best feature in MERCENARIES IS MERCNET. The new mul. tiplayer engine, MercNet improves on NETMECH by allowing you to use all Mechs from MECH2, GHOST BEAR'S LEGACY and MERCENARIES. It sup. ports the traditional modem and LAN connections, but even more exciting is the built-in support for free play over the Internet. That alone is reason enough to want MERCENARIES. MECHWARRIOR 2 was the best Space Sim of the past year (and perhaps best ground-based SF sim of all time), and MERCENARIES is a fitting sequel that will be remembered as a classic in its own right. $45.00, Activision, (310) 473-9200, www.activision.com #4: Shattered Steel HATTERED STEEL, the first effort from developer Bioware, is a mechanized warfare sim with a style of its own. Players assume the role of a mercenary (sound familiar?) who is sent out in the cockpit of a very large robot (called a Planet Runner, but it's a Mech or Herc to be sure) to check out a routine disturbance, only to stumble onto a deadly alien race bent on conquest. The main stars of SHATTERED STEEL are the graphics and the inter face. The aliens have biomechanical constructs, and the beautiful texture-maps laid on top of insect-like models convey this combina. tion of flesh and metal. The interface is also quite simple, thus mak: ing the game accessible to novices The fast-paced combat combined with the simple keyboard interface will make SHATTERED STEEL a game for players of all skill levels. Also, multiplayer support is built-in, so you can blast your friend's Planet Runner when the Al bores you. SHATTERED STEEL distinguishes itself from the rest of the giant robot games out there primarily with its fantastic rolling voxel landscape, which adds a unique \"take cover\" factor to gameplay $49.95.

"SPORTS #1: NHL Hockey 97 001 HOLID SPORTS elcome to the next generation of PC sports games. EA Sports has long ruled the roost of PC action sports games, and NHL HOCKEY 97 represents a new pinnacle of achievement, upping the ante not just for hockey games but for all action sports games in general. Even if you think you don't like hockey, you'll want to check this one out, just to see how it looks. Because once you see the motion-captured 3D polygonal players skating around on the ice in this game, you'll never want to go back to a 2D game again. As with the previous version, NHL 97 offers exhibition, season and playoff games in three levels of difficulty. All 26 NHL teams are included, with up-to-date player rosters and ratings, along with five international teams (Canada, Europe, Russia, Scandinavia and USA). This version can run within DOS or Windows 95, and also supports modem or LAN play for two computers. If you have a Gravis GrIP for each computer, up to eight players can play on the two machines. (Unfortunately, NHL 97 does not support more than two machines, and both computers must have the CDROM-this is the game's biggest bummer.) EA has always made their games easy to get into and play, and NHL 97 is no PORTS exception. The JONIC ARTEI new setup screens are mod els of intuitive design, and the two-button con trols are easy to master and offer a much greater variety of moves than you might expect. And watching those moves has never been better, with eight camera angles and an outstanding instant replay feature, which lets you focus the camera on any player, the ref, either net, or the puck. Among the great touches you'll notice in this game, if you watch closely, are the reactions of certain players, who will smack their sticks on the ice and even grumble out loud after making a poorly played move or being sent to the penalty box. That's the kind of small but realistic touch that really makes this game so enjoyable. EA's NHL franchise has always suffered criticisms for its unrealistic Al, and this version is not likely to change the minds of those who could never deal with it. But what EA has always done best is make games that are extremely playable while maintaining the basic feel of the sport. NHL HOCKEY 97, with its fast-paced action and stunning cutting edge graphic beauty, might be their best effort to date. See our full review in this issue. $59.95, EA Sports, (800) 245-4525, www.ea.com by Jeff \"The Sporty Ell\" Green h, winter! For sports fans, this is the greatest time of the year, not necessarily because of the sports themselves, but because of the cruddy weather outside, which gives us the best imaginable excuse to park the ol' kiester on the sofa, grab a truckload of chips and flip on a game or three while feeling no guilt whatsoever over neglected responsibilities. It's also a good time to fire up the PC and give your favorite sports games a go (since actual physical activity would be out of the question in this weather). The great news is that we're right in the midst of a real renaissance in sports games, with bet ter-looking and better playing games than ever before.

There are a lot of good golf games on the market now, but Access' Links franchise has been the game to beat for years. This year's model, LINKS LS, is no exception.

In the computer sports world, that honor belongs to Sierra's FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL line. The latest version of the three-peat CGW Sports Game of the Year award ('93-95) makes the list because of its heritage, but ranks further down this time because, frankly, we haven't seen it yet. Still, we're talking FPS FOOTBALL here, the best football series of all time, and until a contender proves otherwise, this is still the game to beat. For the '97 version, Sierra is adding modem and LAN play, adding Windows 95 support, redesigning the play editor, improving the General Manager Al and redesigning its Camera Angle Management System. Because we haven't seen it yet (it should be out by the time you read this), we can't tell you whether these changes will be successful and compelling enough reasons for longtime fans to upgrade, but for new users at least this should be a no-brainer. All the features that have made this game great will be back, including its stupendous career mode, unparalleled statistical model and outstanding on-field action.

"-SPORT S PORTS 00110 #4: NCAA Championship Basketball Wils BELE Ent Ent alk about your hoop dreams. While EA's NBA Live franchise has done a good job in the last couple of years of bringing NBA action to the computer screen, the hapless college basketball fan has had no decent game to play and don't talk to us about COLLEGE SLAM-we said decent). That's why we're psyched about the arrival of GTE Entertainment's NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL, a game that makes a serious effort at recreating March Madness in all its glory on the PC. Sixty-four real-life Division 1 teams are included (with accurate real home courts, colors and logos), which you can play in exhibi. tion, regular season, and NCAA tournament mode. 199293 What we've been enjoying most are the game's career features. You can compete with other schools to recruit top (fictional) prep stars and then watch them flourish or flounder under your program as you work towards the Sweet 16. On the court, the game's graphics don't match the crispness of Microsoft's new FULL COURT PRESS, but they're not bad; check out the reflection on the parquet, for example, or the fluidity of moves such as behind-the-back passes and alley-oops. $59.00, GTE Entertainment, (619) 431-8801, www.im.gte.com #5: ABC's Monday Night Football Kordell Stewart Quarterback Height 6.3\" Weight: 210 Years: 0 Age:0 Jersey. 10 College: N/A Pass Acc: 0 Read Cvr: 75 Arm Str: 0 Pass Rel: 0 Scramble: 80 Roll Right 70 Roll Left: 70 Fumble 78 Available Players N O'Donnell Qe M.

Sierra's Front Page Sports: Football line is still the game to beat, but this is the year when some serious competition is finally beginning to muscle in. Leading the blitz (now that Accolade's LEGENDS 97 FOOTBALL has been delayed) is ABC's MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL from OT Sports. With all of the Disney ABC money backing this thing up, OT Sports has created a football game awash in multimedia chrome, successfully recreating the glitzy atmosphere of the TV show, right down to commen: tary by Al Michaels, Dan Dierdorf and Frank Gifford. If that's all this game had to offer, though, we'd respond with a resounding \"big deal,\" because we all know how long that matters. But MNF has the gameplay to back it up. While definitely leaning towards the action side of the spectrum (which will keep it accessible to a wide audience), MNF abounds in nice, surprising touches, including an editable playbook, an easy system for calling audibles, editable stats and a variety of trick plays you can call. Add to that a two player modem option and Internet play over Dwango, and you have the most exciting rookie player to join this year's computer football lineup.

"S PORTS #8: Full Court Press #6: Tony La Russa Baseball 3: 1996 Edition gell, this isn't the NBA Live killer that some people were expecting, but it's a pretty darn good basketball game nonetheless-from Microsoft of all peo ple--that should at least keep hoop fans happy until the arrival of NBA Live 97 next year. FULL COURT PRESS actually does one-up EA's game in a few respects. The game's graphics, while maintaining a similar 2D, cartoony look, are in fact much crisper than in NBA Live, making the action much easier to follow. The sound, too, is quite good, with effective play-by-play commentary from Kevin Calabro (announcer for the Seattle Supersonics). A 100-deep playbook is included, with each play diagrammed out, so new bies can visually grasp what a pick and roll is-and then test their skills in a noncompetitive practice mode. Because team performance is based entirely on individuals' ratings, the game has suffered some criticism (from us includ. ed) that it unrealisti cally makes champs out of teams like the Washington Bullets, whose players look great on paper but can't get it together as a team. But since the game's release, Microsoft has done a good job of letting people know online how to tweak player stats for better realism. For the Evil Empire, this is a job well done. $44.95, Microsoft (206) 882-8080. www.microsoft.com n the day this was written, Tony La Russa-after just one sea. son-had taken the St. Louis Cardinals to their first NL East championship since 1987. The man is a winner, and so is the computer baseball game that bears his name. Though the computer base ball scene has been getting mighty crowded of late, in our minds no game has done a better job of simulating the real thing over the last couple of years than the Tony La Russa series, and this lat est version continues that tradition. TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 3 96 is pretty much just an update to the previous version, but what it adds greatly improves certain aspects of the game. Along with cleaning up some of the controls in the action mode (still the weakest part of this game), Stormfront improved the game's already outstanding statistical model with new head-to-head pitcher/balter stats and situational batting stats. Those who live and breathe base. ball numbers will be in heaven here, especially given the program's easy interface for comparing and juggling player stats. The graphics in this game are beginning to show their age and will really need an upgrade next time, but for now, for those looking for a nice compromise between action and simulation, this is the perfect choice. $39.95, Stormfront Studios, (415) 479-2800, www.stormfront.com ONTWA USA #7: NHL Powerplay '96 eleased earlier this year, Virgin's NHL POWERPLAY '96 offers an inexpensive, credible alternative to EA's NHL HOCKEY for PC hockey fans. Of particular note is the game's Al-which has always been NHL Hockey's weak point. While still essentially an action game (purists should probably just stay away from both games), POWERPLAY impresses with an Al that makes players seem as though they actually know what they should be doing out there, rather than just flying around in a chaotic, pixellated frenzy. The game also includes outstanding GrIP support, offering a level of control as solid as you'll find in console games And speaking of consoles, you should be forewarned that while the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions of POWERPLAY offer outstanding 3D graphics, the PC version is unfortunately 2D only, and it lacks SVGA support as well, making the game look considerably behind the times. Nevertheless, it's half the price of NHL Hockey, and some hockey fans actually find it to be the more satisfying game.

"SPORTS SPONS #9: Triple Play 97 In The Bullpen ge've already recommended TONY LA RUSSA 3 '96 for the baseball numbers geek, but what about the guy or gal who just wants to get onto the field and whack some balls around? For you, slugger, we heartily recommend EA Sports' TRIPLE PLAY 97, which upon its release instantly claimed the crown of best PC arcade baseball game on the market. Excellent sound and graphics (with the full MLB license), Grip support for up to six players, and simple controls make this a phenomenally easy and accessible game to play for baseball fans of all levels. Though certain aspects of the game, like the strike zone, are unrealistic to the point of being ludicrous, consider this: Back in September, we had a chance to watch real-life Padres Tony Gwynn and Wally Joyner play this game head-to-head on a PlayStation, and Gwynn actually had to stop playing, because the realistic feel on the plate was freaking him out to the point that he thought it might affect his timing when playing the real thing. How's that for a recommendation? $59.95, EA Sports, (800) 245-4525, www.ea.com #10: Total Control Footbal ccolade's NFL LEGENDS 97 was the number one entry on this list up until the day this article was due-and then we found it slipping to January, or possibly even to the beginning of the '97 football season, because Accolade decided the new engine needed further refining. Another sure bet for this list, EA Sports' Madden NFL 97, is actually out, and we even have a copy, but some major compatibility problems are keeping us from rendering judg. ment--so we're docking it for now. On to brighter topics. Three very strong golf titles that are making their way to the stores should all pose a formidable challenge to LINKS LS. Accolade is readying the latest version of its Jack Nicklaus golf line, JACK NICKLAS FOUR, which features an all-new course architect so users can design their own 18-hole courses. Sierra is expanding its FPS line with FPS: Golf, due by the time you read this. The game is being designed by LINKS 386 lead designer Vance Cook (a good sign) and will apparently introduce a new golf swing technique using the mouse. Hmmmm. Interplay's VR GOLF is due around January: the early PlayStation version we tested recently was stunning to look at and a blast to play. Sierra is also set to release TROPHY BASS II, the follow-up to its surprisingly popular fishing simulation of last year, now with competitive play over modem, LANs or the Internet. Other major releases to keep your eyes peeled for in early '97 include ABC Sports' COLLEGE FOOTBALL from OT Sports, Empire's SOLID ICE HOCKEY (rumored to have an outstanding Al) Accolade's HARDBALL 6, EA's NBA Live 97, and NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB and STRIKER 96 from Acclaim. Finally, the Macintosh sports scene has always been a barren wasteland, so we're happy to mention that one game at least has finally made it to that platform: Interplay's VIRTUAL POOL. Okay, so it's \"Just pool.\" but it also happens to be the best darn pool game on the planet, and should make a great gift for the hapless Mac sports gamer in your life. re you the kind of person who spends more time at work futzing over your fantasy football team than doing what you're getting paid for? Do you find yourself muttering to yourself on the street or the commuter train about the latest boneheaded move made by Al Davis or Art Modell? If so, then you're the kind of sports fan who should get a kick out of Philips Media Games' TOTAL CONTROL FOOTBALL, a game that can best be described as a managerial role-playing game in which you run every aspect of an NFL franchise from the top down. Developed by Blue Sky Software, TCF lets you hire and fire your coaching staffs, scouts, trainers and administrators; woo draft picks and free agents; manage the team's income and expenses; edit your playbooks and game plans; even study X rays of injured players. (The game's one glaringly bad omission: no computer-initiated trades.) You can play football, too. in an arcade module, but this is not the game's strong point, nor is it the reason to buy the game. TCF is shipping as a single player game, but it will be available next year on the Engage online gaming service, where up to 30 teams will be able to compete in either managerial or arcade modes. $49.95, Philips Media Games, (800) 883-3767 www.philipsmedia.com DECEMBER 1996 "

"STRATEGY 11. Master Of Orion 2 OLIDAY HO his is the ultimate game of galactic conquest, and is the only game that can truly claim to be \"Civilization in space.\" As the eagerly anticipate sequel to Master of Orion, Master of Orion 2: Battle at Antares has a lot to live up to, but it wouldn't be the number one game on this list if it didn't have the features and the gameplay to succeed. In this grand game, you guide one budding space civilization from ignorance on its home planet to conquest of nearby star systems and eventual colonization of the entire galaxy. Along the way, you will research new technologies and weapons, manage your \"Houbaul serve Propose Treaty reak Treaty Demand Offer Gift Exchange Tech Declare Wor Surrender Good Bye The great Grolam and Mellorcame together for yet another important-moment in history. by Elliott The Real-Time Elt\" Chin his holiday's lineup of strategy games is among the strongest of recent years. Strategy gamers can expect to play more, and better, sequels, as we see follow-ups to HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC, COMMAND & CONQUER, FANTASY GENERAL, and more venerable games like MASTER OF ORION and LORDS OF THE REALM. Another theme creeping into the strategy genre is real-time combat. WARCRAFT IL and COMMAND & CONQUER proved that realtime gaming can succeed, and the popu. Jarity of these two games, combined with their earnings, have compelled many publishers to go the real-time route. Yet, though you can expect more real time games to continue the fine tradition of Blizzard's and Westwood's brood, you will still find excellent turn-based games to excite those of you who like to ponder over your moves and muse on how to slowly take over the universe. Any of these games, real-time or turn-based, would make the perfect gift for you or your neighborhood strategy gamer. colonies, battle and parlay with new civilizations and boldly explore where you enemies hopefully haven't explored before. Master of Orion 2 also offers a powerful external threat: the ancient and powerful Antaran race, who lurk in the periphery of outer space, waiting to attack you and all the other races. Master them and you will gain new technologies. But beware. They harbor a deep hatred for the residents of your galaxy, and defeating them will be a much harder goal to accomplish them mere conquest of your neighbors. M002 also has a raft of new features, the least of which is an SVGA facelift. Now, you can manage individual colonies in similar fashion to MASTER OF MAGIC or CIVILIZATION. In another nod to their other great creation, MASTER OF MAGIC, SimTex also has added heroes to M002, though they add bonus points and abilities to your existing armies rather than supplanting them with neargame-unbalancing power. Combat is also fleshed out, with ship boarding and more involved planetary invasions. New races have also been added, such as the telepathic and aquatic Trilarians, the omniscient warrior women called the Eldarians and the greedy and diminutive Gnolams. MOO2 also lets you customize your race with a large set of advantages and disadvantages. Lastly, perhaps the most important addition of all is multiplayer capability. MASTER OF ORION 2 supports hot seat, null modem, modem, local area network and soon even Internet play through TEN. You simply cannot go wrong with M002. As a single player game, this is the ultimate in expansive god games, and with added multiplayer gaming, it becomes a truly addictive gaming experience that will steal your every waking moment just as surely as CIVILIZATION II has. $60.00, MicroProse, (410) 771-0440, www.microprose.com CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"STRATEGY #2: Heroes Of Might and Magic II EROES OF TH THE MIGHT AND MAGIC won CGW's Premier Award for Best Strategy Game of the Year because of its simple, intuitive interface, expansive scope and surprisingly addictive gameplay. The sequel, HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC II, has all these features, but it also adds to this foundation to deliver an even better gaming experience. This time around, the campaign is much better integrated, with players having the option of playing for (and later betraying) either the good or evil side. Your success or failure in each scenario will affect what happens in the rest of the cam paign. For exam ple, if you success fully save the dwar ven king doms, you will be rewarded with double dwarven recruitment for the rest of the game. Cut scenes are also being added to the game to enrich the plot of the campaign. The game is further enhanced with a larger battlefield, a new point system for magic casting, two new classes and dozens of new monsters and artifacts. We've played HEROES II, and we can safely say, any strategy gaming fan will be happily addicted to this incredible sequel. STBA, New World Computing, (818) 889-5600, www.nwcomputing.com #3: Red Alert OMMAND & CONQUER was a good real-time strategy game, and co-winner of our Strategy Game of the Year award. It's sequel, RED ALERT, though, blows C&C away. RED ALERT is actually a prequel, and chronicles an alternate history where World War II was waged, not between the Allies and Hitler, but between the Allies and Stalin. As the Allies, you'll have greater naval firepower, but as the Soviets, you'll have air superiority. RED ALERT offers dozens of new units, including sea and air units for more diverse and complete battlefield engagements. Gamers who bemoaned the Al and pathfinding in C&C will be pleased to know that RED ALERT offers drastic improvements in both areas. The computer is much tougher in RED ALERT, and you can save formations and issue waypoint movement for better control of your armies. Multiplay is also enhanced in RED ALERT, with six-player IPX LAN play, as well as Internet play for head-to-head matches. The graphics are also improved for RED ALERT, with all gameplay rendered in gorgeous SVGA.

"STRATEGY SOOO RP Space (5.6> To #4. Star General TAR GENERAL is the fourth game in SSI's GENERAL Series, and looks like the best in the series so far. Based on The Fleet anthology, edited by David Drake, the game is an epic space struggle as you guide a race of humans against alien forces in a campaign of space naval engagements. The combat system is an improved version of the FANTASY GENERAL one. One of the most noticeable improvements is the split screen menu, which lets you view both the tac tical screen in hall-screen and your menus and unit stats on the other half-screen. Some other changes include the appearance of production structures, which must be built in order to support specific types of troops. Terrain, such as craters, and space bodies, like black holes, also affect gameplay, reducing or restricting movement. There are two forms of combat-land and space-as you must conquer each planet after you clear its surrounding space. In this way, you'll go planet-hopping from system to system in the robust campaign. With a OBDOPD000000 Cruiser (10) Fuel36 Annas Experience AAAA Luna City Cluse 10 great depth of gameplay and many more new features, STAR GENERAL should keep both the GENERAL fans and new strategists well-occupied for weeks to come. $45.00, Mindscape/SSI, (800) 245-4525, www.ssionline.com #5: Dungeon Keeper Place crest ast year, everyone was hoping DUNGEON KEEPER would be the role playing game to revive that sputtering genre. This year though, as the game nears completion, its entire focus has changed from role. playing to strategy and action. You still play from the other side, as a villain, the Dungeon Keeper, who must guard his lair from the greedy invasions of paladins and just war. riors. It is now a strategy game, though, because you basically dig and modify your dungeon, hunt for gold, build structures as in COMMAND & CONQUER and recruit appropriate monsters, such as dragons or goblins, to defend your lair. You gain extra power for every good soul that you destroy, but also lose power for every one of your minions who is destroyed. You can either click and command them, as in real-time strategy games, or enter the very mind of one of your minions and fight in first-person mode against the oncoming horde of goodie-two-shoes. Once you've managed to fend off the looting masses in one level, you move on to the next. DUNGEON KEEPER will have multiplayer options for death matches, and should still captivate gamers with its unique premise and excellent gameplay.

"WAR GAMES #1: Age Of Rifles HOLIDAY here are few books, much less games, that can encompass a half-century of history in detail, without either sounding pompous on the one hand, or leaving out vital information on the other. Nonetheless, AGE OF RIFLES somehow manages to illuminate a period often shrouded in myth and mystery with a remarkable blend of energy and elegance. You can relive the emergence of the United States as a hemispheric power through a campaign on the Mexican-American war, then follow that experience by walking in the boots of Grant, Lee, Sherman and other famous (and infamous) Civil War generals, in battles that are lively, challenging, and consistently true to their real-life counterparts. Similarly, if you think the sun set prematurely on the British empire, you may defend the honor of Her Majesty \"The Soldier Queen,\" in the most unique campaign of any wargame you'll see this year.

SSI'S PANZER GENERAL rekindled the wargame enthusiasm of many with its fastpaced play and challenging campaigns, but left a bad aftertaste in more historically-sensitive palates. Times have changed for the better, however, and this year's crop is a veri. table wargamer's smorgasbord, bursting with historical flavors from every era of warfare. From the famous bat tles of Waterloo and Antietam to the most obscure engagements of the 19th and 20th centuries, the mix of multimedia, excellent graphics and interfaces, strong Al and well-designed scenarios make any of these games fine gifts for the would-be Napoleon or Patton on your holiday shopping list.

Increasing tensions with old allies may find you in traditional European-style warfare versus the Russians in the Crimea. Through all of the battles-many separated by years of uneasy peace-the technology continues to develop, meaning that you must learn new tactics constantly, or be left behind on the battlefield. In addition to the famous campaigns, there are many obscure conflicts, such as the bloody set-piece struggles of the Russo Japanese War, to keep any student of history captivated for untold evenings. AGE OF Rifles also features a robust scenario editor that allows you to create every detail from orders of battle to what type of feather to place in the helmets of your dashing Lancers.

"WAR GAMES \"ALLAMES #2: Antietam alonsoft doesn't get the credit it deserves for making the Civil War fashionable again. Every game in their BATTLEGROUND Series has improved, and this rendition of the bloodiest single day of the American Civil War should be no exception. The regimental scale allows for maneuver and finesse that larg. er-scale games lack, and it also showcases the wide assortment of weapons-carbines, smooth bore muskets, Kentucky long rifles, even shotguns-that made this a quartermaster's nightmare. ANTIETAM is defined by terrain even more than SHILOH, the last BATTLEGROUND release. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia is nestled perhaps too snugly in a cul-de-sac near the small town of Sharpsburg, as the Rebel soldiers fight desperately to hold the vastly superior Union forces off in the famous Corn Field and Burnside's Bridge. The toughest thing to achieve in any game on this battle is balance, so Talonsoft ex 52,9 x Height I clear intends to limit the command control for the Union player to simulate McClellan's indecisiveness. The designers also plan to include a \"Union fantasy\" scenario, where all restrictions are lifted, allowing you to roll over the Confederates and end the Civil War in 1862. Regardless of which sce. nario you prefer, this one is another can't miss for any Civil War aficianado. $54.95, Talonsoft, (800) 211-6504, www.talonsoft.com Options 13> MIALCHAS Abrams Ready ENEMY SEEN: 10 SHOTS: 3:3:3:3 RANGE: 100 bexes MOVES: 1 result, the sequel does more than move the system to the modern era. From what we've seen so far, it also improves the computer opponent, making it more aggressive and less predictable. Mortars and artillery seem to have a better feel than before, and \"scat. ter\" much more realistically. The graphic look-already excellent-has changed for the better, with even the sandTurn 5 Length 26 filled battles of Desert Storm improved over their WWII brethren. SSI is hinting at a wider range of battlefield sounds as well. In general, the interface is a bit cleaner (although still being tweaked at press time) and probably more accessible to novices than the original. And while play is still turn-based, it seems even more brisk than before, no doubt due to the increased lethality of modern weaponry. With better armor, more air resources, and bigger guns all around, it seems there's little to keep this off any would-be Schwartzkopf's hard drive-even if (like me) you're still campaigning with the original.

The air war over Germany from 1943 to 1945 pitted the remnants of the Luftwaffe veterans against the resurgent Royal Air Force and the vast numbers of the USAAF, in a campaign every bit as important as that of D-Day-and OVER THE REICH lets you fly squadrons in any of these three air forces, in both campaign and single dogfight mode. Early jet planes can easily out-accelerate their propeller.bound brethren, but can't turn as well as the nimble Spitfires and P-51 Mustangs.

"WARGA MES / #7: Battleground: Waterloo /2 #6: History Of The World hile BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG was a very good game, it didn't prepare us for this. The patented Talonsoft cut-away hex view combines with the lead miniatures-style soldiers (that you don't have to spend several weekends painting!) to cre. ate a sumptuous graphical landscape that just perfectly captures the flavor of the era of Napoleon. Walled chateaux are tough to crack, so Hougomont becomes the anchor for the Allies under Wellington that it should be. Cavalry charges and square formations for infantry defense may not please all the purists, but they work well within the game's context, and dump a ton of tactical decisions in your lap. The tension of the fighting around the left and center of Wellington's line is captured in exciting fashion, complete with artillery barrages and confused melees. You can even commit the Old Guard at that crucial moment in the battle, as the Allied reinforcements led by Blucher appear ominously on Napoleon's right flank. Great fun solo or two-player, this is the game that will let you finally move beyond the venerable BATTLES OF NAPOLEON. $54.95, Talonsoft, (800) 211-6504, www.talonsoft.com iven all the years that Avalon Hill has seemed ruled by Squad Leader and its children, it came as a big surprise when this simple multiplayer game knocked Advanced Squad Leader from its perch as the top-rated AH boardgame in the bi-monthly poll in The General maga zine.

There's plenty of decision-making here: keeping your army fed and clothed is tough: procuring ammo for the mol ley assortment of weapons your soldiers favor is even more difficult. Bold maneuvers and a steely nerve are required to win the tough campaigns, which unfortunately don't include the YR DECEMBER 1996 "

"WAR GAMES #9: Zulu War! 2 2 f you want only to re-fight Rorke's Drift or Islandhwana, you'll have to settle for the battles in AGE OF Rifles. ZuluWar is a fastplaying, yet more than passingly historical view of the entire Zulu campaign. Without getting enmeshed in minutiae, it shows the contrast between the swift, sudden attacks of the Zulu, and the methodical sweeps of the British. Clash of spears meets Maxim machine guns, if you will The quick and dirty victory conditions force the British to burn Zulu kraals and hunt down Cteshwayo against a difficult timetable, much like that of PANZER GENERAL. Zulus have the option of fighting a guerrilla war, bringing neutral tribes into the war, taking the fight to the British camps, along with a host of other clever \"what if\" options. While ZULUWAR! lacks the tactical feel of Jeff Lapkoff's earlier ALAMO and CUSTER'S LAST COMMAND, it still cap. NH tures the feel of an obscure campaign, complete with \"Hollywood\" scenario for anyone needing their Zulu Dawn movie fix. $39.95 (+ S&H), Incredible Simulations, (408) 554-8381 #10: American Civil War Other Battles f combined arms is more your cup of tea, AMERICAN CIVIL WAR gives you all the land, sea and siege you can handle. It's a bit clunky, and it doesn't really use the Windows interface to any great advantage, but the scale is right. You get a real sense of conducting campaigns in the Civil War, where half the battle is knowing exactly where and with what troops your enemy is moving. The leader modeling is first-rate: McClellan is organizationally sound but timid on the bat tlefield; Bragg is aggressive, even impetuous; Stonewall Jackson moves and fights with deadly. smooth efficiency. Logistic considerations can be a pain at times, but never take over the game. And the naval aspects, so often ignored in Civil War games, are authentic, up to and including the power-and the difficulties-surrounding ironclad warships. All in all, this is still the only strategic Civil War game worth buying BOX Game Settings N on Overview Build Forces Status canner PL.dk NEW JERSEY HOOT Atlantic aval warfare, 19th century style, seems to be making a comeback: AGE OF SAIL from Talonsoft lets you control formations in realtime; WOODEN SHIPS & IRON Men may finally ship its turn-based combat system in time for Christmas. Given the ambitious schedules of both these compa. nies, we suggest prospective Admiral Nelsons keep a lookout from the conning tower. Finally, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention SHILOH, Talonsoft's five-star Civil War battle game, which brildiantly captures the tense struggles around the Bloody Pond and the Sunken Road.

"HARDWARE #1: Righteous 3D HOLI DAY HOT HARDWARE Righteous 3D It Must Be 20 So Real It Real-Tin teractive Randering Ful Mati Tre Re Palace Skanus M Akratie * Windows 95 D SD Suppen Includes www Sarware Tides by Dave \"The Techie Elf\" Salvator, Loyd \"The Hardware Hacking Elf\" Case, and Denny \"The Early Adopting Elf\". Atkin aybe now they get it. Despite the fact that gamers have driven the PC hardware industry for more than 10 years, the gaming enthusiast market hasn't received its due. Well, 1996 may well be remembered as the year many big players suddenly figured it out. We've seen the beginning of the 3D graphics revolution, a crop of new, fast CPUs, and plummeting memory and storage prices, all conspiring to make a killer gaming rig less cost-prohibitive. What's more, just about every major system vendor is now bringing out a tricked-out gaming rig (see this month's Ultimate Gaming Machine feature). In addition, we've seen some interesting controllers hit the market, and here we take a look at ten items that would make anyone's holiday a lot merrier. helves this holiday season will be brimming with 3D graphics accelerators, but most are mere pretenders to the title. A few-a scant few-can be called capable performers in the 3D world. Even the better ones make some compromises, but not the Righteous 3D. Using the sophisticated 3dfx Voodoo chip-set, and loaded with 4 MB of EDO DRAM, the Righteous 3D is a 3D-only accelerator. The board needs its own PCI slot, and attaches to your normal 2D card via a pass-through cable. 2D/3D boards had to make design compromises so as to support VGA for DOS, and run Windows programs, but not Orchid. Righteous 3D's game is blistering 3D acceleration, and it makes no pretensions to anything else. The feature set is certainly robust. There's separate memory for textures and frame buffer (2 MB each), and it supports perspective corrected texture mapping, bilinear and trilinear filtering, and MIPmapping These features make the tex. ture-mapping prevalent in ORCHID High Performance 3D Accelerator Be Righteous today's 3D Frentures games look Revelay 3D Tech pleasing and realistic. The card even sup ports layering of multiple textures, a feature absent on some high-end professional 3D accelerators. Light sources, alpha blending (for transparency) and fog effects round out the feature set, enabling the creation of wonderful atmospheric effects. Its maximum resolution is effectively 800x600, but the image quality is superb. Even the Microsoft Direct3D game, HELLBENDER, with its strange mishmash of textures, looks good with this card. The performance it there, too-the Orchid card is the current performance champion of the game. oriented 3D accelerators. Not only do the current crude benchmarks bear this out, but HELLBENDER'S frame rate at 640x480x65,530 colors with all the features turned on never dropped below a rocksolid 28 frames per second. The card installs easily, and its Windows 95 setup is straightforward. Bending the thick, shielded pass through cable is a bit of a chore, but the extra shielding is good to have There's a handy utility for setting Righteous 3D's refresh rate, and the software bundle is decent: with demo or limited versions of DESCENT 2, HELLBENDER, SCORCHED PLANET and VR Soccer, plus the full version of WHIPLASH. With Direct3D support, future 3D titles developed for Windows 95 will really hum on the card. A number of game companies are porting existing DOS titles as well. There is a downside (other than requiring a PCI slot): it ain't cheap. Shelling out $299 for a card that still has limited uses-given the relative dearth of shipping 3D-accelerated titles-can give one pause. But if you're looking for stellar 3D acceleration that will more than keep up with new titles as they ship, then check out the Righteous 3D. $299, Orchid Technologies, (800) 545-5733, www.orchid.com DECEMRER 1906 "

"HARDWARE #2: Force FIX f your holiday gift target is a fan of flight simulations, a gift of a CH Products Force FIX joystick is probably the best inexpensive alternative to buying them a ride in the real thing, The handle of the Force FIX is nearly identical to the one on CH's F-16 Combat Stick, but that's where the resemblance ends. In the heavy base of the Force FIX are motors and gears that allow the stick to provide programmable resistance to your efforts to move it, similar to what you'd feel when using a joystick in a real aircraft. When using the Force FIX with FIGHTER DUEL, for instance, you not only feel resistance when you attempt to turn the plane at high speeds, but you also feel the constant vibration of the plane's motor. Fire the guns and the stick jerks with recoil. Similarly, the driving game NEED FOR SPEED SE lets you feel the textures of the ground you're driving over-a slight hum on the highway, and a constant bumpiness on off-road tracks. At a price similar to that of a high end flight stick, the added realism afforded by the Force FIX is a bargain. $150, CH Products, (619) 598-2518, www.chproducts.com #3: SupraSonic 336V + Suprasonic works swimmingly under DOS, and helped keep head-to-head play pretty smooth in a variety of DOS titles. With its 33.6-Kbps maximum data rate, the SupraSonic will negotiate down to 28.8 Kbps when connecting to those modems. But as more 33.6 Kbps modems hit the streets, you'll be ready and waiting. Mediocre phone line conditions may sometimes force connection speed down to 28.8 Kbps or lower, but as more 33.6 Kbps units ship, connection speeds will hopefully head north. SupraSonic's ROM can easily be flash-updated when new firmware revisions are released. Another cool feature: an LCD display, which displays what the unit's doing-dialing, negotiating and the type of connection that's been established. Given its ease of installation, LCD display unit, and good performance running DOS titles, the SupraSonic makes a great gift for the pathological online gamer in your life. $289, Diamond Multimedia, (800) 727-8772, www.supra.com he SupraSonic 336V + is Diamond's high-end modem, and since fast-paced games tend to mercilessly pummel modems with data, this unit will move your online adventures along nicely and is worth the extra bucks. The SupraSonic 336V+ is an external Plug and Play modem, and Windows 95 detects it sans hiccups and installs the appropriate driver. The unit also CG DECEMBER 1996 "


"HARDWARE #4: Jaz Drive o matter how much hard drive space you add to your system, programs will expand to fill it. Even with today's games ship ping on CD-ROM, some still require as much as 75 MB of your precious hard drive space. Add a couple of these mon sters to your gaming regimen and you'll be seriously squeezed for space. Iomega's Jaz Drive cures this problem by offering you practically infinite storage. The Jaz Drive is a one-gigabyte cartridge based hard drive. This SCSI device looks just like the 100-megabyte Zip Drive (itself a great gift value at $150 or less), but the resemblance ends there. Where the Zip offers expandable storage in small increments, with a small speed penally, the Jaz Drive is as fast as a standard internal hard drive. One. gigabyte Jaz cartridges sell for under $100, allowing easy expandability in large increments. You can install games on a Jaz cartridge, or even copy an entire CD to a Jaz disk if you want to speed loading or smooth animation playback. If your PC isn't equipped with SCSI, you'll also want to pick up lomega's PCI Jaz Jet SCSI card. Although hard drive prices have plummeted, even a big, inexpensive drive adds only a fixed capacity.

Most current Windows 95 games only support Microsoft's 2D DirectDraw API or the older WinG library, so it makes a certain amount of sense to get a very fast DOS card that is also a capable Windows performer. Enter the Hercules Dynamite 128/V. There is no faster DOS card on the market. The Tseng ET6000 chipset uses MDRAM (Multibank DRAM), speeding memory transfers along to the tune of 600+ MB/sec on the card. Windows performance is less spectacular, but we expect Hercules will deliver better-tuned drivers over time as they've done in the past. Installation is straightforward: plug the card into a free PCI slot, boot to Windows and run the supplied installation utility-the CD-ROM even has an Auto Play script. In a departure from the standard \"let's add five tabs to the Display Properties control panel\" approach, Hercules gives you a single page, all-in-one Windows utility for configuring the card.

"HARDWARE #6: GrIP #7: Toshiba 12X CD-ROM ravis' GrIP technology is changing the face of action-based gaming for the PC. Similar to Sega's Saturn devices, GrIP controllers sport six main buttons and two top buttons. Designed with adult hands in mind, the controllers' buttons and directional thumb pad are respon sive, and feel great. The stealth-bomber shaped Multiport consists of four 9-pin GrIP sockets and two \"pass-through\" 15-pin ports for garden-variety joysticks, though you can't use both types of controllers at the same time. The GrIP Sports Pack ships with a Multiport, two Grip controllers, and Electronic Arts' NHL HOCKEY '96. An additional benefit: no more contortion acts trying to get at your sound card's game controller port whenever you want to switch joysticks. Installation is a snap.

"HARDWARE #9: SpaceOrb 360 in the days of WOLFENSTEIN 3D, the keyboard was the controller of choice. But for new titles like QUAKE, DESCENT II and DUKE NUKEM 3D, the keyboard/mouse combination rules. SpaceTec has a different idea with their SpaceOrb 360: a controller that provides that same functionality, and becomes the sole device for playing 3D action titles. SpaceOrb 360 features a \"power-sensor\" orb that can be pushed, pulled, and twisted around, and also has six programmable buttons. Sound weird? We thought so too, until we played with it. There is a learning curve to climb, but its Trainer utility will help you get acclimated, and once you get going, you may never go back. After some initial fumbling around, we were able to circle strafe with extreme ease in DUKE NUKEM 3D, and could easily outmaneuver robots in DESCENT II. One downside: SpaceOrb 360 needs a free COM port, which becomes tricky if you've already got both ports in use with a mouse and modem. With a little patience, SpaceOrb 360 can be a terrific controller for 3D titles, and Windows 95 support means you can drive newer titles as well. $99, SpaceTec IMC, (508) 970-0330, www.spacetec.com. Dat 016 #10: MindDrive Minddrive nother entry in the unorthodox controller arena is perhaps the most intriguing controller we've ever seen. With MindDrive, you can actually drive simple games with your thoughts. It does take some getting used to, but it's a little unnerving to have MindDrive's games actually respond to movement commands you're thinking, The first computer product operated by human though without a keyboard or mouse. Admittedly, the current technology is somewhat limited, and it can't yet be used to drive more complex titles. But the upside there is that MindDrive can't upload your naughty musings to the FBI either. How does it work? There's a sensor that attaches to your index finger, and from that MindDrive reads in bio-electric patterns, and is able to interpret these patterns as you think certain thoughts. So MindDrive isn't \"reading your mind\" per se, but rather has a pretty good idea what's going on. But, attention all prevarica. tors: one of MindDrive's applications, Fib, is an excellent lie detector. There are currently ten MindDrive titles shipping, ranging from a skiing action game to an application that makes music based on your thoughts. Unfortunately, MindDrive can't drive more conventional game titles yet, though that may be in the offing. It's a technology which, if refined, has tremendous potential to change how we interact with our machines. $149.95 with two titles, The Other 90%, 1-800-706-0456, www.other90.com. DECEMRER 1906 "

"KIDS' STUFF #1: Pajama Sam HOLIDA \"DAY HOT KIDS' STUFF by Charlotte The Elf High Commander Panther s the entertainment software industry continues to grow, you'll find stores devoting more and more shelf space to \"edutainment\" titles, each one promising to teach your kids, reading, writing and 'rithmetic in ways you've never seen before. But beware: We've discovered, all too often, that when developers concentrate on emphasizing the educational element, gameplay is frequently sacrificed in the process. The results: achingly dull, repetitive activities labeled as games. This year we've tracked down a terrific selection of original and challenging games that parents can feel good about. With strong story lines, high quality graphics and fascinating char acters, these products promise to entertain your children, time after time. And while most of these programs focus strongly on gameplay, your kids will definitely learn some things along the way. In \"No Need To Hide When It's Dark Outside\" re you afraid of the dark? If so, you'll appreciate the enormous challenge Sam has ahead of him. For the first night ever, he must prove his valor by sleeping with the lights out. But how can poor Sam sleep, knowing that Darkness is lurking in his closet? What would his hero, Pajama Man, do in this situation? He'd capture Darkness, of course. And that's exactly what Sam decides to do. In order to succeed on his quest, Sam will need you to help him locate his Superhero tools: a mask, cape, flashlight and his Pajama Man lunch box. When Sam steps into his close to begin his search, he discovers a fantastical world on the other side of the door. The landscape of this wonderfully, eerie place certainly has a nightmarish quality to it, but don't worry about your kids being frightened: They'll be in point and click heaven when they discover all the secrets hidden in the realms of this enchanting land. Remnants long ago discarded to the back of your closet, like a baseball bat and ball, miraculously come to life and interact with each other when you click upon them; French fries sing Frere Jacques, and you'll be amazed to see how furniture boogies, when it thinks no-one's looking. With all this entertainment, it's easy to forget that you're on a mis sion, but poor old Sam will soon cry out for your help, when a clump of trees hold him up for customs. His much cherished Superhero tools are confiscated, and wind up being scattered all over the realms of Darkness. As you venture through landmines and underground rivers on the way to Darkness' house, you'll make friends with characters like the lovable Otto, a little wooden boat, who thinks he can't float, and Carrot X, a freedom-fighter from the Vegetable Liberation Front. You may even be invited to join a game of cheese and crackers: Tic-tac-toe, with edibles. The latest in Humongous's \"Junior Adventure\" series, this wonderfully executed adventure game is intended for children age 3-8 and will succeed in entertaining, right across that range. Younger kids who are not yet capable of understanding all the elements of gameplay will be fascinated by the sheer amount of activity they can control by clicking on the screen. Older kids will be challenged by this fairly sophisticated adventure game. Replayability is unlimited, since each time you start a new game the gameplay changes. Not only will you have to search for your Superhero tools in different places, you'll also encounter new characters and discover different environments. Humongous has come up with a winning combination: The captivating landscape, amiable characters, upbeat sound track and endless gameplay variations will delight every member of your family. $39.95, Humongous Entertainment, (800) 499-8386 or (206) 486-1212, www.humongous.com CG DECEMBER 1996 "

You'll learn even more about the countries, as you join Pink on his journey across the earth. The only disappointment?

The Screamin' 3D differed a bit from the other two boards, particularly in performance. In D3D test, fill rate was a bit faster, but polygon perfor: mance was slower. This showed up in Hellbender, where the average frame rate seemed slower than the other two Verité boards. However, the performance of the accelerated version of Quake seemed quite similar, as did IndyCar2. Like the other Rendition OEMs, Sierra will be bundling the shareware, Rendition-accelerated version of Quake, which will also let the full retail version take advantage of the Rendition chip. Of course, being a game company, Sierra plans on bundling its own games. Sierra plans to sell and support the Screamin' 3D through its retail channels.

The folks at 3D Labs sent us a Permedia reference board with 4 MB of VRAM. The drivers were pretty solid, and We were able to thoroughly exercise the card and chip. DOS VGA and SVGA performance was below average, and Windows performance was also a bit sub par. However, the card did quite well in our Direct3D bench. marks. Interestingly, the card not only came with the Permedia chip, but also 3D Labs Delta chip, which handles a lot of the geometry setup chores, offloading the main CPU. This was reflected by better polygon numbers with Delta enabled. Oddly, Hellbender did worse with the Delta enabled, according to 3D Labs, this is because many games (including Hellbender) have relatively low polygon counts, and Delta performs better when lots of polygons are thrown at it. Permedia already has OpenGL and Windows NT 4.0 drivers, great 3D performance and passable Windows and DOS performance. When Permedia.based cards ship, they might be an interesting answer for those people who have to do \"real\" work in addition to playing games. Work in Progress: PowerVR The PowerVR chip is already on cards in some Compaq home com. puters. Videologic will be shipping PowerVR cards onto retail shelves sometime this winter. Like the 3dFX boards, PowerVR boards are 3D only, requiring a PCI slot and another graphics card. However, the 3D fea. ture set is much more limited, The PowerVR also has the capability of storing textures in system memory. Unfortunately, we weren't able thoroughly wring out the card, as it requires DirectX 3.0 from Microsoft, which is just now shipping. We did look at a PowerVR-accelerated version of Mechwarrior 2.

Maybe I'll get a little less mail after December 25th. The mail we get before the 25th is bad enough.\" \"Uh, sure Santa, anything to help.\" At this, he hung up Well, I don't know if it was really Santa, but he has a point. This holiday season, you'll probably see that new game or piece of hardware that you'd been anticipating. So I dug into my e-mail box and found some unpleasant experiences peowas sitting at the keyboard trying to finish the graphics card article when the phone rang. The distraction was annoying. \"Hello?\" I said tersely: \"Hello. Is this Loyd Case?\" \"Yes.\" \"This is S. Claus. Can we talk for a moment?\" I took the phone away from my ear and stared at the receiver for a moment. \"Come on, who is this?\" \"Santa Claus. From the North Pole. Have you got a minute?\" \"Sure.\" Maybe, I thought if I humor him for a few minutcs, he'll go away and leave me alone. \"You know about the letters we get before Christmas asking for presents?\" «Of course,\" I replied. \"When I was a kid, I sent a few myself.\" *Right. Did you know about the letters we get after Christmas?\" \"Uh, no,\" I replied, mystified. \"These last few years, we've been delivering a lot of computer hardware and computer games. We try to keep up with the trends. But in the last couple of years, we've been getting a huge amount of mail after Christmas asking us for support, and the elves are just swamped.\" \"Can't say I'm surprised.

When he clicked NO, the installation program exited. Somewhat annoyed, he ran the installer again, but answered YES this time. Therein began a nightmare of system reconfigurations, downloading new drivers and hours spent reinstalling Windows 95. While MARATION 2's installation is particularly egregious in its refusal to install at all if you don't want your graphics drivers overwritten, most Windows 95 games that use Direct Draw ask you this question-even when you have the latest and greatest drivers alrcady installed. Come on, I thought, Windows 95 was supposed to reduce the amount of tech support required to rin a game. My advice is to get the latest possible drivers. If your card vendor isn't going to support DirectDraw in your particular card-because it's ready to collect Social Security-get a new card. Newer Win 95 titles have probably been written to DirectX version 3.0, but a recently purchasce boarch may have shipped with DirectX 2.0 drivers, so you'll need a driver update from the vendor. Another piece of advice: if the game refuses to install if you refuse to have it replace your driver, retum the game.

Recently, Western Digital and Quantum have begun shipping 3+ CB EIDE drives. Seagate is on the verge of shipping a + CB EIDE drive. The prices look pretty good, but getting one of these big drives may actually cause some major heartbum. The culprit is the ROM BIOS in your computer. Even some of the more recent BIOSes out there can't support a 3 CB drive, so you end up with apparently less space than you paid for. The right solution is to get a new BIOS from your system vendor or dealer. If you can't obtain one, you'll have to look into a clisk manager, like Ontrack, which is a device driver that lets your operating syslem see the full capacity of the disk. Roland Source: The Roland SCD-15 is probably the finestsounding MIDI wavetable daughtercard. It's a full Roland GS MIDI card that plugs into the wavetable connector on Sound Blaster 16s, AWE-32s and other sound cards with a 16-pin Waveblaster header. Unfortunately, it seems to have disappeared since Roland USA LAB NOTES NO JOY WITH JOYSTICKS We've run this one in the past, but I keep getting e-mail on it, so let's do it again, along with a new twist for Plugand-Play (PnP) sound cards. Trying to get a joystick configured in Windows 95 apparently requires a degree in arcane studies --especially true if you have a PnP sound card and a dedicated game carc. Not one, but two game port adapters appear in your device manager, and neither of them seem to work. Here's how you get them going l'irst, bring up the device manager by right-clicking on the My Computer icon and selecting Properties, then click on the Device Manager tab. Scroll down until you see Sound, Video and Game Controllers. Delete both entries. Now reboot the system. Since the sound card is a PnP card, Windows 95 will detect the joystick port and add it in. Now bring up the device manager again, and find the entry for the bailed out of the consumer desktop audio market. Fear not, the SCD-15 and its General MIDI-only sibling are still available from a company called Edirol. They are selling the SCD-15, SCD-10 and a host of other Roland desktop gear.

"SCORPIA  ADVENTURE/RPG Tadven'turn Role-Playing's & Cutting Edge tion All Here At Last, DAGGERFALL IS A Real, Epic RPG Of A Lifetime ew games have been as eagerly anticipated as Bethesda Softworks' THE ELDER SCROLLS: DAGGERFALL especially given the horrid dearth in quality CRPGs these days. Other than Blizzard's DIABLO, this may well be the only role-playing product we have until sometime next year, which makes the interest in DAGCERFALL. all the greater. In particular, people want to know two things: Is it better than the game's prequel, ARENA? Is it as buggy as ARENA? The answer to both questions is yes. We'll come to the problems in due time; right now, let's look at the game itself. Your character is a trusted confidant of the Emperor of Tamriel. He sends you to the royal court of Daggerfall because the ghost of Daggerfall's previous king, DAGGERFALL is the closest thing to real roleplaying I've seen outside of the ULTIMAS. HAY THERE Horseback riding through the streets of Daggerfall. This is one of the game's more earthly (and earthy) ways to travel. Lysandus, haunts the streets at night, calling for vengeance. No one knows why. Your job is to find out. There is also a secondary mission: 'The Emperor sent a letter to the queen of Daggerfall that never arrived. He wants you to find out about that, too, and retrieve the letter, if possible. You start for Daggerfall, but a storm wrecks your ship and you end up in the dungeon of Privateer's Hold instead. This is where the game actually begins, and your first task is lo escape the Hold and get to Daggerfall itself. CRYSTAL BALL s we close the curtain, adjust our cape, and gaze into the crystal ball this month, your adventure game soothsayer is getting a vision of a famous text adventure game that begins with Z and ends in K. The middle letters are a little blurry. What we see, in any case, is a vision of hard-working people at Activision commencing development on the next game in this series, which will apparently be much more humor-oriented than the previous title. First, however, the company is finishing up their graphic version of another classic text adventure, PLANETFALL, due for an early '97 release. Another intriguing title coming up is REALMS OF THE HAUNTING, a 3D adventure/action hybrid (using the NORMALITY engine) with an epic story line of good vs. evil. The game looks and feels like an adventure game, but with combat sequences punctuating the ride. Could be the type of genre-buster that the more adventurous among us crave. I GOT SKILLS Anyone who played ARENA will find much that is familiar in DAGGERFALL The view is again 3D, with movement by cither mouse or cursor. People stroll the streets during the day, and clicking the cursor on somcone will usually begin a conversation. Seasons and weather change; you can find yourself trudging through rain, snow, fog, or sunshine. As before, combat is in real time. Spellcasting is done by bringing up the spellbook, which temporarily freezes the action while you choose an incantation. However, though much is the same, DECEMBER 1996 CG "

"SCORPIA option licre. You pretty much have to do a dungeon in one expedition. Towns and cities are as large as they ever were, but the town automap is greatly improved. Now, the shops, taverns, and guilds are highlighted in different colors, making them easy to pick out. If you look at such a building while walking by, its name is written automatically on your map. ADVENTURE/RPG ook to the L spirit, for there lies the battleground.. THE BAD AND THE UGLY From all this, you may get the idea that DACCERFALL is a huge game, and it certainly is. The game box says «200 hours of play,\" and that may well be a conservative estimate; I put in close to that just getting through it at breakneck pace (or as close to breakneck as DACGERFALL allows). The game is deliberately designed to be played slowly, and for some people, it could easily be a lifetime project, there is so much to do here, not even counting the main line. But every silver cloud has a dark lining, and the lining in DACCERFALL can be rather dark at times. Most annoying is a startling omission from the manual that as soon as a character achieves 100 percent in a primary or major skill, level gain stops. That means no more hit points, and no more stat points to distribute. It could also prevent you from finishing the game if it occurs too soon, and that can happen quite easily. All anyone need do is buy a cheap spell at the Mages Guild, sit in a safe place (an inn room, for instance), and cast that spell over and over again, forcing the skill rating up. While boring and monotonous, that would eventually get the skill to 100. Now, if the character is still low-level at that time, he or she is skunked, because some parts of the main quest only kick in when the character reaches certain levels. Since the character is maxed out, however, that will never happen, and the game is at a permanent standstill as far as the main line is concemed. There are players who will do this; it's a standard (if tedious) technique that is often used in games with skill-based systems (DUNGEON MASTER 2 and STONEREEP, for instance). Even players who don't do this, but otherwise use magic heavily, may be caught in the trap. It is inexcusable that this information is not presented in the documentation as a waming that advancing too far too quickly can have disastrous consequences in the game. Another annoyance is that you get only six save positions, which for a game of this size is totally inadequate. There should have been at least 10 of them. I could have lived without the cute snapshots if it While there are no ridelles in DAGCERFALL, a number of dungeons have puzzles, mostly involving levers of one kind or another. Generally, there is no way to figure these out except by a lot of dull trial and error. This is especially the case in the final dungeon, which has CLASS NAME: STR FRIMARY SKILLS 50 INT 503 WIL MAJOR SKILLS SKILL ADVANCEMENT FOR CLASS DIFFICULT HIT POINTS PER LEVEL HELP AGI 50X END 50 PER MINOR SKILLS AVERAGE EDIT SPECIAL ADVANTAGES EDIT SPECIAL DISNDUANTAGES EDIT REPUTATIONS SPD 50 LUC EXIT 50 1 EASY SELF-MADE MAN Forget those pre-hashed characters.

If we must have puzENDGAME zles, they should be solvable by reasoning Yet, for all its faults, DACCERFALL is still and inspection, and/or clues in the game, a tremendous product.

"SCORPIA Daggerfall Tips ADVENTURE/RPG How To Cheat Death, Steal, And Increase Your Skills In DAGGERFALL This month's column would normally have been the mail, but with the release of DAGGERFALL, I decided to switch and offer some game tips for it instead. I suspect most readers won't mind (heh). -Scorpia appear in your inventory without notice. After you reach level 3, check the \"Clothing & Misc\" slots every now and then to see if a missive has mysteriously appeared there. ACCERFALL. requires patience. It was designed to be played slowly. Not a lot happens at first in the main story line. You could easily feel at a loss after reaching Daggerfall, where nothing \"special\" is happening. Don't worry about it. Much depends on both the passage of time and your character's level. Just hang out, enjoy yourself, and things will start to roll, beginning around level 3. However, don't go too fast, too soon. The final quests won't appear until level 10, so don't max out any primary or major skill until after that, or you'll be stuck. Minor and Miscellaneous skills are not a problem, since they can only rise to 90 percent. Your character should have some ability in spellcasting. As in ARENA, this one is weighted toward magic-using classes. I recommend at least 1.75 Int in spell points, or more if you can manage it without making progress too high. This is the most important spell in the game. It gets you out of those huge dungeons quickly, which is particularly useful when you're on a quest. Teleport is instantaneous, so you have more time to find what you're looking for before the time limit runs out (many quests have time limits). Just remember to set the anchor before leaving town. Anchors are a oneshot deal; after you've returned to the anchor site, it's gone. The best temple is Arkay; you only have to rise one rank, from Novice to Initiate, to buy magic potions. No other temple allows this at so low a rank. Make sure you always save the game before asking for a quest from anyone. While the patch file has fixed a number of side quests, it's likely that some escaped notice. You don't want to be stuck with something you can't finish. While you can take your time getting to the main line, don't neglect any main line quest. It is vital to do all of them on time. Blowing a main line quest, or refus ing one, means you can't finish, because you're only asked once (not a good thing). You'll know that something is part of the main line when a courier hands you a letter. However, on occasion, a letter will LEARN BY DOING Coing up in any organization depends on your rep with them (increased by questing) and skills they consider important. Just doing quests alone isn't enough; relevant skills have to be improved, too. Every time you gain a new rank, at least a month must pass before you can go up another, whatever your rep or skill levels may be. For the four main guilds, what they value should be evident. With temples, it isn't obvious what the important skills are. To find out you can (a) save the game, (b) join a temple, (c) pay for training, and see what's offered. That will tell you what they're looking at. Then, if you don't like what you see, restore the game and try a different temple. \"Train when you're low in level. Training anywhere costs character level x 100, and you get the same results whether you pay 200 gold or 800. Generally, training only improves a skill by 1 percent, and someBAD REPUTATION Whether your character is custom or pre-made, always answer the 12 background questions at the end. If you don't, the game does it for you, and you may not like the results. I clicn't do it, and came in with a high reputation with the underworld, so all the non-guild quests I was offered ranged from smuggling to murder. Urgh! I ended up doing guild quests only. Join the Mages Cuild for access to the Spellmaker, and get the Teleport spell.

"PETER OLAFSON ACTION action (kost Ecstatic Again ECSTATICA 2 Brings The Round Look And Great Action Back To The PC AT ndrew Spencer's world is decidedly round. ECSTATICA, his clipsoid answer to the polygonal ALONE IN THE DARK, was published without much fanfare late in 1994 and quickly earned huzzahs for its realistic feel and visceral combat, as well as a few jabs for its modest dimensions. ECSTATICA 2, due from Psygnosis around February or March of next year, looks poised to garner more of those huzzahs and, this time, fewer of those jabs. An carly version reveals that this action-adventure with accent on the action is much larger, prettier, deeper...and rounder irony--but are forgetful of history. No one ever figures out that holding an established hero as prisoner (rather than killing him outright) inevitably results in the valiant escape of said hero to dish out some mcan payback. Naturally, this mess is a prelude to a larger purpose. Evidently a sorcerer has been WHAT'S UP?

Instead, sneak by his door and, if it comes to a fight, sock him a few times until he appears dazed and then abandon the field and hide in the grassy patch in the far corner of the barn to heal up.

The cozing golslinesque drones around you snap to attention, and the battle is joined. And this time out, you're much better equipped to fight it in detail. Your character in Ecstatica had only a modest number of options: move, pick up items, attack with the left or right hand, and clodge. That was it, but at the time, it seemed like plenty. Spencer has since discovered the virtues of the Ctrl and Alt keys. When used in combination with the direction arrows (sensibly simpler than ECSTATICA'S number keypad controls), these procluce a claunting range of maneuvers-including karate-like jumping kicks and punches, rolls, back flips, and some roundhouse swipes that put me in mind of a similar, decapitating maneuver in the classic Epyx beater DEATH SWORD. Alas, there were no flying ellipsoid heads that I could see. However, you will see spurting elliptical blood. Of course, there's no shortage of enemies to do the spurting. Giant spiders rule the ground. Something akin to a walking rock is guarcling the entry hall, and a hulking something-or-other-the camera never gets close enough to show you just flat polygon.

First, get software for editing 3D models. Breeze Designer for Windows (freeware by Neville Richards) is my current favorite. However, Breeze cannot directly handle model (.mdl) files, so you'll need Meddle (freeware by Brian Martin) to \"convert\" mdl files to the raw format that Breeze understands. IT'S A BREEZE This freeware program, Breeze, makes it Use Winpack to extract easy to change the fundamental sizes of objects, like the desired .mdl file from grenades, or warp creatures even further. the appropriate pak file. Then use MedLe to extract araw file from the indll. Models for the player and monsters cach have many frames because of animation. These models require frame-by-frame extraction (you'll have to type MDL-E FRAMEIRAWI PLAYERMDL. for the first frame; MDL-E FRAME2.RAW 2 PLAYER MDL for the second; and so on). Let's start with a simple, single-framed model, such as the grenade, as an example. Use Winpack to extract grenade.mdl from pako.pak, and then use MedDLe to extract grenade.raw with the command line MDL-E GRENADE.RAWI GRENADE MDL. fire up Breeze and start a new \"scene.\" From the file menu, import the .raw file. Since you're only modifying an existing model, select points from the palette bar along the left side. Use the mouse to expand the grenades dimensions by dragging the vertices outward. Because of the true 3D nature of the models, you'll find yourself working in several windows simultancously (i.e., XY Front, YZ Side, and X. Plan views). It's bizarre at first, but with a little tinkering you'll soon get the hang of it. Save your handiwork as a Breeze.cad file, and export it as a raw file. Then import the raw file back into the original .mdl. To import grenade.raw into grenade.mdi via MedLe type MDLGRENADE.RAWIGRENADE.MDL, hit (2) for 2D mode, and then hit (s) to save. The existing skin will stretch to fit the vertices. Put the grenade.mdl and progs.dat into the appropriate subdirectories, and voila!

"SNEAK PREVIEW DESCENT TO UNDERMOUNTAIN NOII) V Get Medieval UNDERMOUNTAIN Builds On DESCENT With AD&D-Style Role-Playing by Elliott Chin 13 / 30 CSNEAK GPREVIEW t's no secret that as the competition gets stiffer in the 3D action genre, companies are adding nontraditional action elements to the mix in order to broaden their games' appeal. HEXEN may have madle role-playing fashionable for action games, but DESCENT TO UNDERMOUNTAIN has a much greater chance of tapping the potential of this exciting new gaming hybrid. UNDERMOUNTAIN brings the visceral appeal of Parallax's DESCENT 3D engine to the Forgotten Realms city of Waterccep, from Advanced Dungeons Dragons, where you adventure through more than 20 levels of dungeons. In most cases, you explore them on foot; flying around DESCENT-style is reserved for those who find the right magic spells. And instead of shooting your enemies from afar, you hack-and-slash them in the true spirit of ADD, up close and personal. Just as in DESCENT, UNDERMOUNTAIN offers 360-degree viewing and 3D environments. Using the mouse, you are free to look in all directions both fluidly and without GAVE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT DUNGEONS OF DESCENT UNDERMOUNTAIN uses the Descent engine to good effect, dumping you in an underground network of fantasy and magic, where you'll hack your way to the ultimate evil. even invert the axis of the mouse, something you can't do in DUKE. restriction. Certain levels also take advantage of the 3D, so that bats will attack you at eye level, while below you will be pits with skeletons. At the current stage of development, UNDERMOUNTAIN didn't seem to have levels as advanced in 3D architecture as QUAKE. On the other hand, the controls are completely customizable, and after a few tweaks, I was able to run through the dungeons with my usual QUAKE configuration. You can \"Behind the Scenes\" Combat he combat system from AD&D is used in UNDERMOUNTAIN, though it is largely invisible. Your \"to hit\" probability is affected by your character level, the luck of the dice and the armor class of your opponent. Basically, every time you swing, the computer will make an invisible roll and check it against the armor class of your opponent to determine if you hit him. You may occasionally get unlucky and miss your enemy, even if it looks like you hit pay dirt. At least the monsters you face suffer from the same limitation, and their to hit\" chances remain static, while your character's attack skill improves as you gain levels. Likewise, you may improve your defense through better armor or magic items-an option not available to the creatures you face, thankfully. WATERDEEP, MOUNTAIN HIGH You have come to this fabled city in answer to a summons by Khelben «Blackstaff\" Arunsun. It seems that the great mage has need of a few adventurers to venture into the dungeons beneath Waterdeep and exterminate the evil that ferments in those subterranean depths. These range from little goblin raiders to an evil goddess named Lloth who threatens to consume Waterdeep itself. As you fight your way through the dungeon, you will grow in abilities and gain more power in AD&D fashion (sec sidebars). One really cool feature of the game is your acquisition of spell use. Only the mage and priest classes can cast spells naturally, but the two other classes, fighter and thief, will find magic items. Most of your favorite ADD spells are here, allowing you to toast goblins with a fireball spell, make yourself invisible, or perforin other feats of prestidigitation. UNDERMOUNTAIN also features a robust multiplayer system, with deathmatches, cooperative play, deathmatch DECEMBER 1996 "

NDERMOUNTAIN Uses more than just the AD&D license to separate itself from other 3D action games. Your character's statistics -strength, intelligence, constitution, etc.-affect how much damage you do, how many spells you can learn, how many hit points you have, and so on. The six different races you can choose to play-human, elf, half-elf, dark elf, dwarf and halfling-each have different abilities. Elves, for instance, can see outlines around secret doors. You also choose to be a fighter, priest, mage or thief. Mages can cast destructive spells, priests have healing magic and thieves can open locked doors. Non-human races will also be able to choose more than one class, so you could play as a fighter-mage combination if you were an elf, or a thief-fighter combo as a halfling. You'll also advance in level as you amass experience points by killing more creatures, solving puzzles and completing quests. Each level advancement will reward you with more hit points and greater abilities congruent with your class (mages will gain more spells, fighters will do more physical damage). Interplay says the level limit in DTU is 7, so you can't advance beyond that level, but the sequel will have a level limit of 12. EL HACK AND SLASH A variety of fantasy creatures are out to get you, and they look nasty and fight tough-though they could use a few more polygons to get rid of their blocky look. DECEMBER 1996 "


"***** REVIEW  CRUSADER: NO REGRET NOTI)V DIFFICULTY LEVEL Another Crusade ADVANCED Origin's Follow-up To No REMORSE Explodes With More Action And Tougher Challenges by Thierry Nguyen year ago, Origin unleashed the CCW Premier Action Game of the Year, CRUSADER: NO REMORSE.

"CRUSADER: NO REGRET REVIEW Honing Your Combat Tactics NOTIV ith the harder missions, it's time for a few new tactics. Here are some basics:  Don't be seen: Everyone knows to shoot the camera to avoid alerting security. How about indirectly destroying said camera? That little puff of fire from your grenades/rockets is affectionately known as \"splash damage\" and can reach through walls. Try hitting a camera with a rocket from around the corner or on the other side of a wall. Here, the explosion from your weapon engulfs the camera on the other side of the wall. Avoid traps: With the designers scattering tripturning a computer on only to be greeted by a fully armed robot kept me on my tocs. Another feature Origin is pushing is the cnhanced Al.

Suffice to say, wires everywhere, you'll want to leave your VIR Imager on as much as possible, especially during the later levels. While it does sap energy, you can see all the tripwires, and cut down on nasty surprises. Rollers aren't Einsteins: Soldiers who roll are usually ones who sit in a comer or behind some boxes. They also don't start rolling until you advance within a certain range. If they are rolling from behind boxes, learn the pattern and fire a rocket or whatever weapon you prefer at the spot they are rolling from. If they are rolling from around a corner, try to explode a spider mine near the corner, hopefully the splash damage will kill them. The worst way to deal with them is to just bear the brunt of their burst and hit them fast enough to kill them. Roll with it: You have a better brain than they do; use it when you roll. Since you can move by crouching, it's very easy to duck behind bars or boxes and crawl about, gun at hand. Rolling forward is a great evasive maneuver, as it is fast and keeps you under some cover.

Each time they do, those ideal war machines invariably tur on their creators before attempting to take over the universe. Thankfully, these consummate killers generally fail to eliminate the best pilot/soldier/kickboxer and pay a terrible price for their negligence as the aforementioned ubermensch proceeds to kick their technoorganic butt. That's the situation you face in HELLBENDER, after the very same Bions you thought destroyed in PURY 3 renew their assault on the Coalition of Independent Plancts. As mankind's last hope, it's up to you to jump in the Hellbender prototype attack craft and wipe out enemy forces over seven plancts and deep space. Microsoft POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE OF SPACE The first thing you notice about HELLBENDER is how gorgeous the graphics are. The ante has been upped considc rably from FURY 3, with beautifully texture-mapped rolling terrain and complex 3D structures. Each planet features a unique environment and look, from the constant acid rain and lightning on gloomy Morbos to the bright green skies and floating mountains of Eyrie. B ut such eye candy doesn't come chcap, and gamers without some serious hardware are bound to feel cheated. HELLBENDER was built to take advantage of Microsoft's Direct3D API and 3D accelerated graphics cards. Without the hardware acceleration and with all the graphics options at their highest settings, even a Pentium 150 with loads of RAM will experience a significant drop in frame rate whenever things start getting hectic.

"**** REVIEW. RETURN FIRE DIFFICULTY LEVEL INTERMEDIATE NOTIV Warped Warfare Capture The Flag Goes Arcade, With Comic Relief by Gordon Goble I Retuin Firm RUN, 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T HIDE Here, a tank has mercilessly squashed a few tents and is now busy chasing down some grenade-lobbing soldiers. ure, RETURN FIRE looks like a real-time strategy game. Yet it plays like a pure arcade shooter, a mix of Capture the Flag with strangely apropos classical music and a down 'n dirty, blow-everything-up mentality. It is also a clever and addictive game that makes war a blast. As the leader of the Browns, your mission is to capture the flag of the enemy, the Greens. They have it hidden away in a «Flag Tower\" (where else?), with a gauntlet of armaments blocking your way. If you blow up enough vehicles and obstacles to secure a path to the flag, you can grab it and bring it home for a victory. The game opens with a cutaway view of your command center, an underground bunker stocked with a selection of three tanks, three helicopters, the same number of ASVs (Armored Support Vehicles) and eight jeeps. Each has its own strengths-choppers are good for pre-strike surveillance and light strafing, and the heavily armed and armored tanks and ASVs with their rotating turrets are perfect for mass destruction. According to gaine rules, speedy little jeeps are the only vehicles permitted to pick up the flag.

RETURN SIRE explode with graphic ferocity. To top it all off, RETURN FIRE is rife with familiar classical music selections, all appropriate in their placement. Like any game that lacks real complexity, and given its repetitive landscapes and simple scenarios, RETURN FIRE will cert ainly become less and less amusing with time. It's not a game that will stay long on your hard drive, but when war is this much fun, you just have to grab hold, hang on, and go for the rice until burnout is reached SHOCK THE MONKEY The battlefield is viewed from a 3D third-person perspective, and the camera pans and zooms automatically in topdown and 3/4 views. There are a hundred missions, clivided into mine levels of difficulty and featuring such names as Shaved Weasel, Chicken Parts, and Irish Spring Though initial levels may take only a few minutes to clear, they do become more challenging and intricate as you advance. For a real thrill, the two player/one computer mole lets both participants vie simultaneously for each other's flags on a split screen, and makes for a good time. Sadly, neither modem nor network play is supported. Sure, it's a glorified version of TANK, but with gameplay that's fast and crammed full of sensory stimulation and warped humor, it's pretty hard to resist. Palm tree in the way? Blow it up. Planning on deserting? Humongous sulamarines emerge and launch deadly missiles at you. Spending too much time sitting still? Enemy chrones move in to finish you off. Blow anything up and it will burn or APPEAL: TANK veterans, and anyone who enjoys fast-paced explosion fests. PROS: Solid graphics with surpris. ing attention to detail; great sense of battlefield comic relief; thunderous sound, and a superb classical music score. CONS: There is no back story, and scenarios get pretty repetitive. No control over camera views and no modem play. CG DECEMBER 1996 "

"REVIEW NHL 97 SPORTS And though I appreciate EA's first attempt at play-by-play commentary (by colorful real-life Vancouver Canucks broadcaster Jim Hughson), his verbiage is sometimes just plain wrong, completely misstating on-ice action. 3D-rendered polygonal skaters, cach built with the program controlling the pitiful upon a player skeleton driven by motionSenators, I eked out a narrow 4-3 victory captured data. Accurate in all directions, pumping 101 shots on goal. Was it fun? the end effect is absolutely uncanny as Yes. Does it in any way make sense? No. players hold and lunge, crash and bang, Yet my complaints get far more specific and act and react with bizarre authenticity than that. Line changes take waaaay too from every angle. These guys even have long, leaving the ice momentarily vacant faces and mustaches and, when penal of that team's skaters and triggering multiized, vent their wrath by smacking their ple breakaway opportunities per period. sticks against the glass. Then, during those offensive thrusts, As has become the norm with EA you'll find your defensemen sometimes Sports, multiple cameras are at your bid hovering just outside, rather than inside, cling, from rafter cams that give an the blueline-a sure no-no in the real overview of the situation to several ice world. level perspectives, reverse angles and Although players are wonderfully more. Replays, with manual control over mobile, jumping on loose pucks and such rotation and angles and featuring once things get going, there's virtually no absolutely monstrous zooms, are beautiful variety to the computer team's attack from enough to bring a tear to the eye, while team to team or level to level it's usually FOX-like \"tails» chart the wake of the same motions in the same places with whistling pucks. Uniforms carry players' the same outcomes. And as for those guys in stripes, they've called COMPARE countless offsides that weren't and have sig. naled at least two goals where the puck did not cross the line (I have the replays to prove it). Built-in human error? hope so. Daniel Allrodeon NIIL. 97 also still has the \"predestined\" feel to Sivota Baru it that I've complained about in previous versions of the game. For example, should the program dictate that you miss eight-foot wrist SUCH NICE BOYS You can compare player stats side-by-side to assemble your shots at open nets? No. dream team of killers. Should it allow you to score two goals in a row names and numbers, and EA has even from the center ice face-off? No. Should a included the NHL's recently adopted computer-controlled team \"dump it in for \"second\" uniforms for good measure. a line change\" when they have a two-man breakaway? No. None of this favors the PUCK FICTION human or computer-controlled teams, But as much as NHL. 97's graphics but it gives you the impression that, no floored me, its gameplay Al and realism matter how good or bacl you are currently left me a bit lisappointed. In command of playing, the payoffs are based on what the the bottom-of-the-barrel Ottawa program wants at that given time. It can Senators, I faced off with the all-powerful fill you with a helpless feeling, and hypothetical Team Europe at the Finally, the lack of an omnipresent time toughest skill level no less-thrashing clock and the conspicuously absent them 5-2 and outshooting them 89-45! penalty clock can be a definite hindrance Taking the same tcams at Rookie level when a tired unit is ready to leave the ice. HIGHLIGHTS AND LOWLIGHTS To be fair, NHL 97's gameplay negatives are partially offset by obvious strengths and improvements over last year's product. Controller button assignments are far more sensible, goalies don't hold the puckad nauseum, and penalties and fisticuffs are a result of your own indiscretions. Five-man units experience graduated/realistic fatigue over the course of time, meaning it's nearly impossible to get a fresh line near the end of a period, and deking a goalie is so realistic you'll think you're really there. Of course, EA's rink sound reflects every audible incident there is. For all its graphic glory, though, NHL 97 is not a wholly realistic depiction of the sport. It's a slam-bang reflex-o-rama featuring spectacular action, cunning animation and overly frequent killer hits. It also has sometimes questionable smarts, viscious yet common trips that should be called \"interference,\" and little of hockey's subticty. It's kind of a playable highlight reel So why do I want to play the darn thing again and again? Probably because something that looks this good and is so much fun to play commands respect, if not quite enough to see me through a full season. Endurance NO APPEAL: Anyone who enjoys computer hockey, with a proviso that the accent here is on visual beauty and action rather than the nuances of the real sport. PROS: The best graphics and animation of any sports game, ever. Exciting if not always authentic gameplay, with user-customized options galore. CONS: No team coaching strategies; Al and realism hasn't improved enough from previous versions, either. Winning is often a matter of how much and how fast you can click buttons.

On offense, coaches can view and select any type of play, run it from any formation, and edit things like motion, blocking assignments and primary receivers on the fly If you can use a mouse, you'll find you can quickly call an audible play in MNE Creative coaches will want to save their most innovative Xs and Os in playbook Berman appears back in the studio offering statistics and advice. The Berinan segment is fun, but his ideas aren't always on the mark. For example, with my QB's stats showing 34-38 for 423 yards and 5 TDs at halftime, Berman suggested that I mix in some running plays because the defense was «adjusting to my passing attack. Even the regular ABC crew stumbles occasionally, with comments that seem out of context with the overall course of the game.

The folks calling the plays at OT Sports apparently aced that class, as the company's inaugural release, ABC's MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, has flat-out nailed the exciting aura that surrounds the NFL's prime-time spectacle. The game's opening sequence is a definite keeper, with Hank Williams, Jr., belting out the now-famous \"Rowdy Friends» theme as video images of gorgeous cheerleaders, screaming F-16s and rocking NFL action flash across the screen. Of course, this has little to do with MNF's play value, but it does set the mood perfectly Once past the opening, would-be coaches arrive at the game's main interface screen. The Monday Night Football Vlook and feel is effectively conveyed here by simulated production truck controls. As you pick opposing teams, for example, full-motion video highlights start rolling on monitors flanking cach team. With your combatants selected, another click will trigger live video previews of the game from Frank Gifford, Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf. This is well done, with team-specific commentary. Other click points allow the gamer to set weather, graphics and assorted play options. Coaches can also jump to team and roster editors, where starters can be replaced and player ratings tweaked. With opposing teams selected, play moves to the stadium. Unfortunately, the on-field action shows MNF at both its best and worst.

Luckily, you'll have some help learning to survive in this cnvironment. SABRE ACE is supposed to include the most sophisticated flight-and combat-training module yet seen in a flight sim. On training missions, you'll be accompanied by a backseat instructor (you'll see him in the check-six view) who will talk you through various maneuvers, similar to the instructors in FLICHT UNLIMITED and AH-64D LONGBow. He won't be reciting a canned script, either. After takeoff, he'll tell you to raise flaps. If you don't do it, he'll follow by telling you which switch (or key, in this case) to use. If you still don't do it, he'll raise them himself and move you onto the next task. Screw up like this in advanced training and you'll hear an exasperated \"how'd you get past Primary, anyway?\" On the American side, you'll start piston-engine training in a T-6 Texan and nove up eventually to the jet-powered T 33 Shooting Star. Russian pilots will start in the Yak-18 and graduate to the two-seat MiG-15UT. Training will encompass topies ranging from basic flight through rendezvousing with friends and enemies alike, and of course combat tactics. Most sims cop out on the formation aspect of air combat by making you flight leader, so the rest of the aircraft in your group follow you. Here, you'll start as a wingman, and it will be your responsibility to stick by your leader. Luckily, along with comprehensive training, Sabre ACE also features Formation Augmentation. This feature is a sort of simple autopilot that can be adjusted to do everything from keeping you from sliding out of formation to practically locking you onto your lead's wing. After flying the alpha version of SABRE ACE with Form Augmentation active, I'm convinced that this will be a much-copied feature, eventually becoming standard on almost all sims. An enhanced Automatic Direction Finder (ADF)/Ground Controlled Intercept (CCI) dial is the only fictional addition to the otherwise authentic instrument panels.

It's a small compromise that adds much to the sim's accessibility. SABRE ACE also has a kneeboard view that lets you check navigation maps and mother information typically found in a pilot's strike notes. NEXT GENERATION ENGINE Because Eagle is entering the flight sim market late in the game, the company isn't saddled with a library of oll code. This has its ups and downs-while SABRE ACE will utilize the latest Win 95 3D graphics technology, the need to build everything from the ground up means we won't see multiplayer capability in the initial release. The graphics are nothing short of spcctacular, taking full advantage of Direct 3D to provide beautiful texture-mapped aircraft and ground targets that look like the ones you're used to seeing in pre-rendered opening animations. On systems with 2D graphics cards, the sim looks good, but it truly shines on a card equipped with a HaRSH Like many CHECK TEN Outside and padlock views will be in fixed increments, as Eagle feels virtual cockpit panning is too slow. MISSION ORDERS After completing the 25 training misssions, you'll be able to fly 45 active cluty missions, from either side of the battle. In addition to the ubiquitous Instant Action mode (in this case, F-51Ds vs. IL-10s). here's also a Custom Combat selection that lets you pit various combinations of aircraft against each other. For a real challenge, take a flight of four Yak-9s up against eight B-29s escorted by four ace F50s. If you just want to practice deflection shooting on easy targets, take a MiG-15 up against a group of T-6 trainers. Given Eagle's experience with actual military sims, expect top-quality flight models in the final product. The Yak-91 lew when I visited Eagle's offices displayed believable turn rates, appropriate energy bleed in tums, and good handling n the landing pattem. Fuel loads and external stores realistically degrade performance. Unfortunately, rather than model lamage to discrete systems (such as loss of chunk of your horizontal stabilizer) and legrading performance accordingly, it ppears the sim will simply use a damageSercentage model. The flight model will include realistic handling of ditching, as many Korean-era pilots preferred to ride their damaged mounts to the ground rather than hang in 1 parachute as a slow target for small-arins ire. If you do choose to cject, you can Rendition Verite or 3D x Voodoo chipset. In keeping with the pilot-centric design of the sim, you'll be able to carry your experienced SABRE ACEpilot over to Eagle's next effort, the Vietnam-based PHANTOM ACE. Although Kinney was mum about the third sim already in the planning stages, EAGLE ACE seems a likely candidate. SABRE ACE will fill a gaping hole in the historical simulation market, and it looks ready to do it with finesse. There are a few things missing it appears the planned Navy missions evident in the alpha interface will be dropped due to time restrictions, as will multiplayer capability in the initial product but hopefully these will show up in an expansion disc. & Barbed Wi Re Enema BIO PURCU Grin PlayStation PlayStation Ciremin PE DOS Licensed from and developed by Gremlin Interactive Ltd. 1996 Gremlin Interactive Ltd.

"SNEAK PREVIEW IMIA2 ABRAMS SIMULATION/SPACE Hell On HighTech Wheels A Game To Make M1 TANK PLATOON Fans Enlist For A New Tour by Patrick C. Miller CSNEAK GPREVIEW GAVESTEL AV DEVELOPMENT ne reason Germany's blitzkrieg tactics were so cffective in carly World War II was the Wehrmacht's deployment of tanks cquipped with three-man turrets, when most allied tanks relied on two-man turrets. Free of gunnery cutics, German tank commanders could coordinate their maneuvers better, spot threats sooner and exploit opportunities more quickly than their counterparts. Today, the U.S. Army's latest version of the MI Abrams main battle tank, the MIAZ, uses advanced technology and cligital electronics to give American tank commanders a similar clecisive edge in combat. An MIA2 commander has an unprecedented amount of information at his fingertips and an unmatched ability to locale, target and destroy his enemies. Interactive Magic's iMIA2 ABRAMS simulation not only accurately portrays those capabilities but also significantly improves upon Unit: m Speed: 0 kph status: O.K. Heading: 83 degrees ANYONE HOME? M1A2's detailed graphics provide stunning views of vehicles and the surrounding terrain. Yes, those are chickens in the farmyard. MicroProse's highly acclaimed MI TANK PLATOON, released in 1989. SPIRITUAL SEQUEL former MicroProse cohorts Bill Stcaly (now chairman of Interactive Magic) and Amold Hendrick (the original designer of MI) have teamed up again to develop a tank simulation that's an evolutionary sequel, rather than a revolutionary advancement of the genre. Those who long for a more up-to-late version of Mi's outstanding gameplay probably won't be disappointed. There are many similarities between Ml and iMIA2. At the same time, the sims new 3D engine-developed by Charybdis Enterprises is a major improvement over Ml's pool table terrain and its boxy, bright red and green vehicles. Hendrick says iMIA2 will feature Ierrain maps from real-world locations in Bosnia, the Ukraine and the Persian Gulf. developed with the aid of satellite imagery, 'The undulating terrain provides the feel of ricing in a tank, and also offers more realistic cover and concealment. The SVGA graphics lend an impressive amount of detail to the vehicles and their surrounding environment. Running under Win 95, Hendrick says iMIA2 will be playable on 486-66 with 8 MB of RAM, although at VGA resolution only. A Pentium with 16 MB will be required for SVCA resolution. When I took iMIAZ for a test drive, I quickly learned the value of the tanks high-tech features. In the original Mi simulation there was little to do while buttoned up in the lank commander's position.

The tank slowed noticeably when it began to climb exp The Real M1A2: Updated Abrams xternally, practically the only difference between the M1A1 of M1 TANK PLATOON and the M1A2 modeled in this simulation is the small, canister-shaped bulge over the tank commander's station on the turret top. This is the Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV), an optical device that enables the commander to spot and designate targets for the gunner, even at night. Internally, however, the two tanks are quite different. The analog systems of the M1A1 have been almost totally replaced in the M1A2 by digital electronics. This integrated system provides the tank commander with detailed information on his vehicle's status and supplies him with navigational data, as well as the locations of friendly and enemy units.

SIB 250 100 900 CSNEAK GAVUSHE IN DEVELOPMENT INSTRUMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS You'll have to judge your own speed as you round the comers at Sears Point, as the unrealistic speedometer is now optional. Test drive NASCAR RACING 2 with the demo on this issue's CG-ROM. TUNING IT UP So, what's new and what's not? According to NASCAR 2 producer Adam Levesque, the oh-so-taxing NASCAR RACING car modeling hasn't been appreciably altered, but that seems to fly in the face of my own experience with the alpha test version. In practice, I found the drive tighter, with less \"wobble\" through the turns-a subtle difference noticeable only on the cruel corners of a road course like Watkins Clen. Papyrus has rebuilt portions of several tracks for NASCAR 2 (there's 16 in all this time around licensing issues preclude Indy and Daytona), and Levesque was quick to admit the reconstructed Watkins len track might have something to do with that seemingly improved feel. Substantial facelifts are also evident at Darlington, in keeping with its real-life high line, and at Tallageda Superspeedway. \"The banking was incorrect, the apron was incorrect, so we redid the entire track geometry. You can't run at full speed on the inside of the Talladega apron anymorc,\" warns Levesque, signaling a move that will undoubtedly have repercussions for NASCAR vets who've been mysteriously acing that circuit over the last two years. LETUPIDEVELOPENT SRCET texture, and NASCAR 2 will be one hotlooking program, perhaps as sophisticated as GRAND PRIX II. There's no more primitive \"-1\" switch needed in the command line to access hi-res mode. Screen resolution is now altered from within the program. Meanwhile, back in the cockpit, the NASCAR 2 instrument panel sports a new layout with added textures and shading, and no more speedometer (not found on real NASCARs) or gear change indicator. Don't worry if you've grown accustomed to those little luxuries, however, because tapping the key will pop both onto the screen, on the left edge of the dash. \"We also toyed with putting in a real shifter, but it would have been in the bottom right corner, where the black box info would cover it up,\" says Levesque. Audibly, NASCAR 2 should be a full lap alicad of the original. Gcar changes are accompanied by a realistic \"kachunk,\" accidents and impacts trigger a volcano of sound, and certain events spark commentary and advice from a talking crew chief. (Check the sidebar for more info on this welcome innovation.) at Per res tit wir MMITTOIHTON CAS 10 EN PAINT TOUCH UP Graphically, NASCAR 2 simply looks more solid than NASCAR RACING, and that is most definitely not just a matter of personal perception. \"We completely redlid the graphics system. Now there's less sparkling in the distance,\" says Levesque. Add in the sudden presence of clouds anda more authentic depiction of grass and road TUNE-UP TIME The integrated car setup screen makes tuning easier, and due to NASCAR regulations you won't have to worry about tweaking stagger and the front air dam anymore.

"SNEAK PREVIEW  NASCAR RACING 2 IN NASCAR DETAIL SHOP DGOCTOBRZEB USKOND SIMULATION/SPACE PRIMESIR HAMM real-life NASCAR mandates, you won't be toying with the stagger and front air dam any longer, and fuel loads are adjustable only in pure practice mode (a change brought about in part by Papyrus advisor Bobby Labonte). All this will have an effect on just how fast a car can go, but such is the price of realism. NASCAR 2's interface has been spruced up and simplified, with fewer screens, smaller fonts, and command bars across the bottoms and tops. The Driver's Info Screen will feature head shots of all FPRIMAC LA SVETU enough, an arcade mode will service those who need a more gentle break-in period. The NASCAR 2 arcade mode wasn't ready for testing, but Levesque insists it will be \"like a super driver's aid with better brakes, better cornering, and more resistance to spinning out.\" When quizzed as to just how arcade-ish it will be, Levesque says that there will be no big mountain with a Sonic Hedgehog on it, but it will be easier to drive.\" As for those all-important vehicle setups, there's marked revisions here, too. Most noticeably, the entire procedure has been fit into the confines of a single screen, looking much like it would on a crew chiefs handwritten clipboard. Now, with everything available at a glance, it's much less confusing and tiresome to jiggle a little here and juggle a little there. A Comments section, designed to hold those little setup notes we've probably all been keeping on paper, is especially nice, but mechanics beware -there are a few items gone or missing. In keeping with PAINT BY NUMBERS The improved paint shop makes it easier to put Marlboro ads on your favorite NASCAR. FRONT END ALIGNMENT One of the prime reasons for the creation of NASCAR 2 is to entice those who found NASCAR RACING just too difficult. In that respect, Papyrus has added Steering Help to its list of driver's aids. Now, with steering, braking and shifting assistance, that mean old pig is suddenly a sweet little piglet. And if that doesn't tame the beasty SPEED RACING The improved Quick Race setup screen makes it a snap to jump into custom races. Life With A Talking Crew Chief competing drivers and provide access to the updated high-resolution car-painting module. Replays, already top-notch in NASCAR RACING, have been improved here as well. Now, lots of background information is displayed as you watch yourself in action, including your current position, speed, intervals, average speed, and best/ast lap times. This is a great way to monitor what you've been doing right and wrong. reen, green, green!\" With those three words, the dawn of a new era in computer racing is upon us, that of the talking crew chief. He's bright; he's verbose; he's excitable; he knows all and sees all. Actually, he's aware of much more than just a single crew chief ever could be, and that's why Papyrus is billing him as a combination crew chief-spotter. Once you've shared a race with this guy, you probably won't ever want to drive any other way. You see, he's much more than just a verbal showpiece. Sure, he's got a solid command of the obvious: when the race starts, when it ends, and that sort of stuff. But he's also an invaluable source of tactical information throughout each race. \"Keep it to 55,\" he'll warn as you navigate through pit lane or threaten a hot entry. \"There's an accident on the back straight.\" he'll advise, which may or not already be obvious depending on whether you caused the carnage in the first place. \"Last lap. You're the man! Bring it home,\" he'll shout as you blaze to victory. For added realism, his phrasing changes from time to time, and each transmission is preceded and ended by a short blast of radio static as his mike is keyed. In traffic, his assistance is even more appreciated and surprisingly adept. Hardened NASCAR veterans know the feeling of diving into a tum as another car lurks perilously just off their right door. It can get pretty dicey, to say the least. But with this Ned Jarrett sound-alike (it's actually Ron Gaines, a good bud of Bobby Labonte) barking directions like \"You've got a car up high, stay low,\" \"He's still there,\" and eventually \"Clear,\" you'll be buying this good buddy a virtual beer post-race. Unfortunately, with the exception of the pit radio keys that have been there all along, you won't be able to directly communicate back to him, and that situation won't change until there's a voice recognition standard for PCs. But if you're anything like me, going back to the original NASCAR without this guy will be a very lonely feeling indeed. START YOUR ENGINES On a more humorous note, I found it interesting that both Dale Eamhardt and a tow truck would be introduced to the game at the same time! C'mon guys, what're you trying to tell us? Actually, Dale's not so bad, and the tow truck, although doing the job, is invisible, so it's a mixed message at best. At this early stage, it looks as though NASCAR 2 will have more than enough to seduce NASCAR RACING owners back for more. It's less imposing for newcomcrs, meaning potential interest outside the cultish Papyrus fan club. And that's just what Papyrus and Sierra are hoping for. & DECEMBER 1996 "

Rip this review from this magazine, and under no circumstances let your significant other go near a software store until this blows over. MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES will be building the ranks of computer widow support groups across the country. Ask my wife-she'll tell you all about it. You may think my warning's a bit extreme. After all, isn't this just Mech 2 with prettier graphics and some new missions? Not a chance!

MEGUWARBID MERCENAR COST CONSCIOUS Certainly, MERCENARIES bears a strong resemblance to its predecessor. You travel from world to world manning the cockpit of a mech-a giant, heavily armed robot using weapons of mass destruction to wipe out installations and enemy mechs. Only this time you're not putting your life on the line for the honor of clan and family. No, in this prequel you're motivated by something much more powerful: cold, hard cash. You'll earn C-bills for missions and objectives you complete, but you also have to pay for every missile and every bit of damage done to your squad. You'll ACIMION need to weigh the time span and risks of a contract against the monetary and salvage compensation you'll receive upon successful mission completion. You can play with the economy disabled, which is just like being back home in the clan. Here your missions will be selected for you. But be aware that you're missing out if you play this way. The mercenary commander always gets the most Cbills, and you'll get whatever falls off of their plate.

Some pilots will lead you with their shots, and they can dismember a mech faster than you can say \"why am I face down in the dirt?\" \"That question reflects another improvement, one that fixes the \"onelegged super-mech\" quirk of MECH 2. Now, when a mech loscs a lcg, it crashes to the ground, where it will stay unless it has jump jets available to right itself. The enemy Als aren't the only ones with improved, variable abilities. Checking out a potential Lancemate (the mercenary equivalent of a Starmate) reveals a letter grade rating for both piloti ng and gunnery skills.

"MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES  REVIEW SIMULATION/SPACE pound the life out of that Commando that you've paid for. On the flip side, there were a couple of bozos I would have killed myself if it weren't going to cost a couple million C-bills to replace the mech they were in! You can also get a hand from some Aerotech (aircraft) support, which you also hire from the same personnel data in your computer. Unlike your Lancemates, these pilots come with their own aircraft and make their own repairs, so you just have to pay them their flat monthly fee. Mission variety is greatly improved. You can pick one of two or three missions available at a given time, which are all part of a nonlinear career path (if you have the economy enabled). There are a wide variety of mission objectives. You'll have to disable a renegade's mech while destroying the rest of his company, destroy a terrorist bomber's truck bound for a hospital targeted for destruction, and capture water tanks on a barren planet from an occupying force that will try to destroy them when the battle is going your way. You'll face missions in the dark, at dusk, in haze, and in the snow. You'll fight on sevcral different types of terrain. All this adds up to cnough variety to keep the missions interesting even after many hours of play. Stop Bugging Me rue to its history with addressing MECH 2 problems, Activision is hard at work addressing user complaint about MERCENARIES. (The first version had some mission scripts that didn't work as users expected them to.) The design and development group has taken the input, bug reports, and suggestions posted online and is busy turning them into patches and updates. This not only covers bug fixes but also includes a MechLab enhancement, a possible change in the salvage rules to include user selection of salvage, and the addition in the future of power-ups such as fuel or ammo trucks in MercNet that will allow you to refuel and repair during a battle. All of these patches and enhancements will be provided free of charge on Activision's online site, as well as being incorporated into future production runs of the CD. If you're having problems with the game, check www.activision.com for updates. MULTIPLAYER MAYHEM Included on the CD is MERCNET, a multiplayer utility based on the NETMECH utility released for MECH 2. MERCNET not only supports null modem, modem, and LAN connections, it also includes a PPP stack for live games on the Internet. With this support, you won't nced Ten, Kali, or any other online server to play over the Net. This extends the replay value indefinitely; you may only want to beat the missions a couple times, but who gets tired of beating up friends? All is not perfect in the online department, however. Due to the inability to connect between the DOS and Win 95 versions of NETMECH because of Microsoft's proprietary DirectPlay roultines-Activision this time included only a DOS version of MERCNET. The DOS MERCNET will run under Win 95, however, allowing you to join your DOS-based friends online. While some problems have been reported with the PPP stack, most people can get online without much trouble. Activision is working on several game patches as I write this, so expect a lot of these problems to be fixed. A FITTING CONCLUSION MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES delivers significant improvements over MECH 2 and CBL while retaining the high-energy action that made those games great. The improvements aren't just visual, but include new features that greatly enhance the gameplay -and game replay --value of this product. & Beway Brore mb PUFOG LOCKCLOUKO ARMS MERCHANT TEXTURE HEAVEN added, causing light reflections from MERCENARIES is based on the same your weapons to bounce off of the graphics engine as MECI 2, but it has ground, buildings, and any other object undergone a major overhaul.

"F-22 LIGHTNING II  REVIEW games who won't mind the space-fighter feelmay be turned off by having to work through the hefty manual to master the MFD modes and 35 essential key commands. Novalogic seems to be aiming between these extremes: casual or beginning flight simmers who care less about total realism than involving gameplay and immersive visuals. LIGHTNING probably won't beat out the three other upcoming F-22 sims on every front, but with its accessibility, smooth network play, and state-of-the-art graphics, it's sure to be a strong contender among this segment of the population SIMULATION/SPACE Multiplayer Modes -22 LIGHTNING II's multiplayer support allows players to hook up via modem, null-modem, or IPX network. Gamers on a budget will be pleased to note that only one CD is necessary, even for an eightplayer network melee. Performance is almost totally free of warps and lag over a network. Unfortunately, 28.8-Kbps modem connections, while smooth most of the time, grind to a crawl when players take off or fire weapons. While it's not possible to add a player to a game already in progress, rejoining after you get shot down is as easy as pressing the (undocumented) Enter key. In a novel twist, players determine mission parameters before takeoff by voting for the selections they prefer. The game supports both cooperative and deathmatch modes. Deathmatch is a free-for-all only-team play is not an option. It's a simple matter to switch between cooperative and deathmatch over a network, but modem players are forced to break the connection and redial. Cooperative missions include some interesting aspects not present in single-player mode. For instance, if your wingman lights up a group of bandits with his radar to identify them, the ID information is automatically datalinked to your display, allowing you to remain stealthy. These missions would be a lot more enjoyable if the game did not contain one truly regrettable omission: there's no way to chat with another player, whether you're in the air or on the ground trying to set things up. This detracts from the fun for players not co-located and severely restricts your ability to coordinate attacks with teammates.

E-mail is an option, but the leisurely pace of sending even a tum a day means that games stretch out for weeks, even months. Finally, there is an alternative: TEN has teamed with SSI to adapt PC for online play. I can already hear you saying, \"Why play a tum-based game online?\" The first reason, of course, is that you get a steady stream of new opponents. In over a week of online play, I never logged onto TEN without finding an opponent within minutes. While there is the usual online mix of beginning, experienced and maniacal players for PC, most gamers were more than willing to accommodate players of varying skill levels. It doesn't hurt that PC has a minimal Icarning curve, cither. If you're looking for a great online strategy game, march to TEN'S PG Online, mach schnell! controlled those of Ceneral Paulus, instead of each player commanding units scatNENERAL tered all over the map. Still, the multiplayer aspects are a boon for online play. In addition to the friendly insults (\"Your tread is dead, mein herr») so customary to online play, you SUMMARILY EXECUTED You aren't necessarily home free can also set up battle here. Make sure that you've finished the setup routine in plans by \"whispering\" your C:\\PGONLINE directory before logging on, or the TEN to your partner during system won't be able to find PANZER.EXE. the enemy turn-a much better alternative WHO'S IN COMMAND? than simply waiting around for your tum The biggest change from the boxed to to come up. There are always arguments online version of PG is that the latter has over the best use of paratroops, where to true multiplayer scenarios. In a battle on lay clown suppression fire, and whether air the castem front, for instance, you may units are better off in ground support or in find the German command split, one taking out enemy aircraft. player having the majority of the air force, while the other has the heftiest armor.

But PC ONLINE the-shelf progenitor, it would be nice if shakes up the traditional flow by offering the forces were split less arbitrarily: if, say, time limits to speed play, anywhere from my partner led Guderian's forces while 10 seconds to 40 seconds per unit (you may still play with no time limits if you month's FAQ page for details. prefer, but I'd suggest finding another Our secret sources reveal that opponent). The biggest departure for PG SSI may finally be turning to the ONLINE, though, is that it lets you move American Civil War.

Well, latency really isn't a problem in a tum-based game, so this will be a lot more fulfilling than a game of, say, DUKE NUKEM or WARCRAFT over a noisy connection. But there are a few things that keep PC ONLINE from completely emulating the five-star status of the original. When you play the boxed version, it's OK if the game is biased toward the German side, because you have those terrific focused campaigns. Despite the increased tactical and strategic options here, however, some of the PG ONLINE scenarios are really imbalanced for multiplayer play. It's a real surprise, given SSI's usual excellent reputation, but I can't believe that either they or TEN playtested these scenarios for anything other than bug-squashing With more tough, balanced scenarios like Poland and German '40, this could have been the perfect online strategy wargame. Where is Narvik, or Fall of France, or Crete or any of the other classic PANZER GENERAL battles? And why isn't there a ranking system for challengers on TEN? For that matter, why aren't there sanctioned tournaments from SSI? When these questions are satisfactorily answered, this could revitalize online wargaming much as PANZER GENERAL did for wargaming in general. &  When you first begin playing PG ONLINE, start with the Poland scenario.

This is a must for coordinated assaults in multiplayer games.  If someone pulls out early or loses connection, don't panic. The TEN software will assign a computer player to take over so you can actually finish the game if you wish.  In multiplayer scenarios, set up for \"interactive impulses of 3-5 units each.

CONS: The scattershot scenario design doesn't replace the wonderful campaigns, and why isn't there a ranking system, or tournaments? better chance of victory when led by a human general.

"**** REVIEW  DEADLOCK DIFFICULTY LEVEL STRATEGY / WARGAMES Better With A Friend DEADLOCK Sacrifices Solo Play For Good Multiplayer Gaming by Tim Carter De Planetary Con El Mo De Deky Toys hen computer games first entered the marketplace, they filled two important gaps in the average strategy gamer's life. First, a computer could handle all sorts of bookkeeping duties like hidden movement, logistics, and so on, that were too cumbersome to deal with in boardgames. Second, computer games were meant to give us a reasonably challenging and decent solitaire gaming experience. Now the story has come full circle, as one of the key selling features in new releases is the ability to play against another person. DEADLOCK, from Accolade, is one of these recent releases. It can be played solitaire, but clearly a lot of effort went into making it a good multiplayer experience, over online gaming services, LANs, serial cables or direct modem connections. DEADLOCK, like so many of its predecessors, is a game of planetary colonization and conquest. You have been sent by your race to colonize a particularly rich and potentially prosperous planct in a remote section of the galaxy. An interstellar truce prohibits fighting in space, so all of the action happens within the planet's atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, however, all allegiances are off, and players can expect to spend as much time fighting as they do building Players take on the role of the planetary leader of one of a range of starfaring races, cach with particular strengths and weaknesses.

"DEADLOCK. REVIEW ued dearth of decent computer Als in today's games, the ability to bash fellow players s is always welcome. Yet, multiplayer capacity does not, and should not, necessitate a weaker interface or a clumsy solo experience. There is no reason why these games cannot be as smooth and original as those intended solely for solitaire use. Is DEADLOCK fun to play against another person? Of course. Could it have been a lot more fun? Absolutely. Does it stand up as a solid solo experience? Not really. The artificial intelligence makes all of the mistakes that Als usually do (like attacking at the same point over and over again), while the interface and game clesign offer no redeeming qualities or structures which might make it challenging. Any game, though, is always more fun when played multiplayer. DEADLOCK is a perfect example of that, because as a multiplayer game, it's great fun. As a solitaire game, sadly, it just isn't.

"***** REVIEW DEADLY GAMES DIFFICULTY LEVEL STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Jagged Alliance, Part Deux DEADLY GAMES Adds Multiplayer Support And A Scenario Editor To The Addictive Combat Of JAGGED ALLIANCE by Loyd Case 1/2011 DOHE U MIRI DE 9 HITMAN BUZZ DO2 MOUSSE STATIC CLIFF MIXE LOOK FAMILIAR? DEADLY GAMES has the same graphics and tactical combat as its predecessor, JAGGED ALLIANCE, but there are enough new twists to lure you back for more. he sleeper hit of 1994, JACCED ALLIANCE blended an addictive tactical strategy game with great RPG elements, along with a rather convoluted storyline. SirTech's sequel, JAGGED ALLIANCE: DEADLY GAMES, dispenses with the silly plot and instead goes for a straightforward, no nonsense military campaign, coupled with a superb scenario designer, multiplayer capability and a limited, but effective, campaign builder. At the center, though, is the JAGGED ALLIANCE tactical combat engine, still superbly addictive after all this time. Some new twists have been added, however, particularly in the campaign. The most noticeable difference is the addition of turn limits. In JAGGED ALLIANCE, you could take your time in completing each mission goal, and spend even more time searching the map for goodies. Now, though, you have to keep an eye on the clock, take a few risks and hustle to accomplish the mission objcctives. This is probably more realistic, but it has generated a lot of controversy among original JA fans. To its credit, the DEADLY GAMES design team has already released a patch that allows users to set a number of different turn limit parameters, including no turn limits at all. 19 DEADY  the game is a great learning experience, but still entertaining enough in its own right for more experienced JA players. The main solo campaign is 34 missions long as I played it) and contains a tremendous variety of missions. Mission goals include retrieving strategic plans, photographing people, passing objects to neutral NPC civilians, and simply fragging all enemies. Some of the missions have tight timetables, and a few demand stealth rather than blatant gun-blazing charges. Like its predecessor, DEADLY GAMES allows you to build your squads with mercenaries from AIM (the Association of International Mercenaries, a sort of trade union for hired guns). Some are very good picks, others are poor; and while the poor ones aren't always cheap, there are a few bargains, too. A number of the less-capable ones also have enough intelligence to get better over time. Each of the mercenaries has a unique personality, ranging from passive to toadying to in-your-face insubordination. As the game progresses, you can hire and fire members of your team, but do so carefully. Some of them will get upset and a few can even influence others, making it more difficult to hire certain mercs. During missions, all team members have something to say, particularly when they bump into an adversary, knock off an enemy or take significant damage. Depending upon mission outcomes, some may even quit on you. Price: $55.95 System Requirements: 486-66 or better, 8 MB RAM, 31 MB hard drive space, 2x CD-ROM Drive, 256 color VGA graphics, mouse.

"STRATEGY  CIVILIZATION II STRATEGYZWARGAMES The last three entries in the advances list (@CIVILIZE) are for user-created advances. Let's create an advance we'll call \"VTOL\" (short for Vertical Takeoff and Landing), which would be something a Harrier attack aircraft would need. However, the unit we'll create with this advance is a ship: the Tarawa-class assault ship, which can carry aircraft and land units. The VTOL advance would look like this: VTOL, 3,-1, CA, nil, 3.0; U1 The Al would consider this a moderately useful but not high-priority advance, and it would be more compelling for militaristic leaders. It requires combined arms, but nothing else (that's what the \"nil\" entry means.) It's a modern era advance and is military in nature. Name, Expires, Domain, Move, Range, Attack, Defense, Hits, Firepower, Cost, Hold. Preg. Flags A settler unit, as an example, would look like this: Settlers, Exp. 0, 1, 0, 0a, 1d, 2h, 11, 4, 0, 5, nil, 000000000000000 Here are the definitions of each value: Name: The name of the unit type. Expires: After this civilization advance, new units of this type Domain: can no longer be Air made. Domain: Movement domain-ground, Def: 1 sea or air (0,1 or 2). Move: This is the number of movement points the unit has. Range: Fuel supply carried by air units. Attack: Chance to hit opponent when Zeppelin Move:4 Att:0 HP: 10 Cost: 40 Shields CREATING A NEW UNIT Okay, now that we have a new civilization advance, let's create the unit. The unit descriptions are listed like so: attacking. Defense: Chance to score hit when defending. Hits: The number of points (10) of damage the unit can sustain before being destroyed. Firepower: Each hit causes this many points of damage. Cost: Build cost of the unit, in shield rows. Hold: How many units a ship may carry. Role: The number designates what special abilities a unit has (5 gives the unit Settler abilities; 0 designates an offensive unit). Preg: The civilization advance that must be researched before this unit is built. Flags: A special number, in binary format, that controls special advantages and restrictions. This number is 15 digits wide, but it's the position that's important. If the second digit from the right is a 1, then the unit can ignore zones of control. This number would look like: 000000000000010. The RULES.TXT file lists all the possible positions and what special abilities they confer. So, since we've already created the VTOL technology, we can now create the resultant Tarawa assault vessel. The Tarawa statistics would look like this: Tarawa, nil, 2, 6, 0, 2a, 6d, 4h, 21, 10, 3, 2, U1, 000000010000001 The Tarawa is an assault carrier, but it's only capable of carrying VTOL strike aircraft and helicopters. It also carries a contingent of marines. Civ Il doesn't like \"dual role\" units, so I couldn't have it carry both land units and aircraft. Having an assault ship carry stealth bombers would have been unrealistic, anyway. Since the Tarawa class aircraft is used for ground support, I generalized the ability by giving it the same capabilities as an Aegis cruiser and allowing it to carry three land units in the hold.

"CIVILIZATION II  STRATEGY 2. Creating A New Look Now we have a new tech and a new unit. But wait -what's it going to look like? The generic replacement for a sea unit is a bit goofy (a catamaran), so I found a photograph of a Tarawa on the Internet. Using Photoshop, I reduced it to a 64-pixel-wide icon and pasted it into the UNITS.GIF file, making sure to use the color palette from UNITS.CIE (Note: you don't need an expensive package like Photoshop; Paintshop Pro, version 3.12, works just as well, and it's shareware.) Next, the Tarawa vessel has to sound right when it's attacking, CIVILIZATION II uses a sound file named CUSTOM3.WAV for the third user unit slot (which is where I put the Tarawa entry). I simply went into the SOUND directory in the Ci Il game directory) and copied NAVBTTL.WAV to CUSTOM3.WAV. Now the customization is complete: a new technology, which spawns a new type of unit, complete with graphics and sound. STRATEGYZ WARGAMES s u se if He beheer A NEW LOOK This is the UNITS.GIF file where the graphic images of all units are stored. You can open it with a competent paint program and alter these units or import files of your own. BEFORE AND AFTER on the left is the picture of the Tarawa taken from online, and on the right is the Tarawa unit graphic created with Photoshop. 3. Playtesting POWER CHESS The only way to tell if any customization adds a positive element to the game is to playtest it. If a unit is too strong (a dangerous temptation), then the AI makes those units to the exclusion of many others. If the unit is somehow not useful, then the Al may never make one. You can also «cheat,\" however. For example, let's say you make a very powerful ground unit, but you never want the Al to use it against you. All you need to do is give the unit a role as a diplomat. The Al won't use it to attack you, but you can freely use the unit on attack. However, these kinds of cheats really make the game less fun. \"POWER CHESS is the first innovation in chess programs in more than a decade.\" Larry Christiansen, International Grandmaster Two-lime U.S. Champion Three-time U.S. Open Champion SAUB 11!

SCENARIOS We've seen how rules, units and even technologies can be customized, but another fun aspect is creating scenarios. The two scenarios supplied with CIVILIZATION II are WWII and Rome. These two only touch on what can be done with scenarios.

"STRATEGY  CIVILIZATION II The riveting new action-strategy game from Actual Entertainment STRATEGYZ WARGAMES \"The graphics are simply stunning!\" -CINET scenario that seemed like a cross between the Battletech and TERRA NOVA universcs, and an Alexander the Creat scenario officially released by Microprose. Creating a scenario is simple. If you want to create a scenario using a particular map, then you either need to find the map (usually online) or create one yourself using the map cditor. If you like, you can even alter terrain graphics, which are in the files TERRAINI.GIF and TERRAIN2.GIF Once you have your map, you start up Civ II as usual, either picking your custom map or having the game build a world for you. Once the game starts, you go to the menu labeled \"cheat\" and then toggle cheat mode to on. Cheat mode is not really for cheating (although you can certainly use it for that purpose), but rather for building scenarios. In cheat mode, you can do a variety of things, including setting the game year, laying downloads and cities, and even placing units. You can edit kings, cities and technologies. In short, you can establish when the game starts, who will be in it and what all the players have. The most important entry in the cheat menu is the Scenario Parameters option. This is where you really create the heart of the scenario. Parameters you acljust include victory conditions, when the scenario starts and ends, how much time passes per tum, and others. There are two important considerations when setting scenario parameters. l'irst, never use \"Special WWII AL.\" This is a special option put in place for the World War II scenario supplied by Microprose, and it can cause mysterious behavior in other scenarios. Second, there is a special victory FIGHTING WITH SOME FORCE These familiar-looking units are part condition setof a custom-designed scenario involving the Battle of Tatooine, com ting, \"Toggle plete with Star Wars troops, from AT-ATs to TIE Fighters to X-Wings. Use Objective Victory Flag\" Setting this means that the game ends when certain objectives (e.g., cities) have been taken. You can specify that Wonders of the World are counted. It's worthwhile playing the Rome scenario to see how an objectives-based scenario works. (For example, you can no longer build Wonders; you now have to capture them.) \"Pure fun\" -Kevin Perry, Happy Puppy Games *V* LE \"I love this game!\" -you AND MORE... There are lots of other things you can do in Civ II, ranging from changing the personalities of the Al kings to altering the default city names. With the version 1.11 update, you can even specify which city improvements the Al will build using the AUTOBUILD option (the patch also includes \"smart settlers,\" which takes a lot of the tedium out of managing settlers and engineers). Take the time to explore, but make sure you back up your files first, before making any changes. The great thing about all of Civ Il's flexibility is vou can pursue whatever level of customization you like. Minor changes are built in (such as being able to turn off spaceship building), and creating a scenario allows you to interactively make some serious alterations to the game. But real customization requires rolling up your sleeves, firing up the bitmap editor and pouring over all the different text files.

AH-64D Longbow V.1.08F: Updated flight dynamics, easier hovering and auto-rotation come to the hot helicopter simulation, along with new rotor/engine sounds. Grand Prix Manager V1.02: Please install version 1.01 before shifting into gear with this latest patch. now have a Key file as well. After installing this patch, make sure to type \"clean\" to get rid of the unnecessary patch files after installation. Check for new patches on this month's disk. Battleground: Waterloo V1.02: This new battle plan corrects errant PBEM replies and solves other random crashes. Heroes of Might and Magic for Win95 V1.1: Anomalies with the cursor and in the Map Editor are magically cleaned up. Warcraft 2 V1.2: Orcs and Humans alike will appreciate the new multiplayer options, including the shareware version of Kali and IPX network code optimized for better performance. The Exorcism spell problem is cast out, and you may now have more than 255 PUD files in the WAR2 directory.

This patch will reportedly work with and supersede all previous patches.

Star Trek Judgment Rites V 1.01 Update (Mac only): Mac users with 32MB of real RAM, or Macs with two monitors, will find this patch more helpful than Mr. Scott during a Klingon attack.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what chwos What's The Deal With... Real-Time? that it can come down to a point-and. click fest. While I used to disregard this objection as another nit-pick, a nasty experience at a WARCRAFT 2 tourney at Seattle's annual DragonFlight convention convinced me that game designers need to take a few precautions in their games, just to make sure the on-line world isn't dominated by annoying, socially challenged adolescents with hyper fast point.n-click skills, honed by the e have a new popular front in wargaming, and like all new things, some are proclaiming it to be the best thing since sliced bread and others are moaning that it's the End of the World. Yes, folks, it is the Age of the Real Time Wargame-and everybody and their dog's software company seems eager to jump on the bandwagon. Virgin and Blizzard get credit for turning this type of game into a fullblown trend with the very successful COMMAND & CONQUER and WARCRAFT series, respectively. Thanks to them, you can't swing a dead PR rep now without smacking some tactical/strate. gic Wargame that has thrown over the traditional turn-based dogma for some trendy real-time combat mechanics-and the old grognards are screaming bloody murder, as if this were the death-knell for the pedantic counter-pushing wargames that they love (the kind that would be just as at home on a board as they are on a computer screen). Since I'm enough of a traditional boardgamer to consider Europa a fine introductory wargame, I think I'm qualified to argue that not only does real-time pose little threat to \"serious\" combat simula. tions, but that in some circumstances it is actually the road to more, not less, realistic games. First of all, let me address the con cerns of \"serious\" wargamers, some of whom have cautioned against the evils of real-time in these very pages. Their greatest fear seems to be that the lack of turns will encourage bad Al, because programmers can make a computer fast instead of smart-and so games will become an issue of reflex reactions instead of brains. (The same tired point was made about multiplayer capability: \"If wargames are all networked, they will stop putting good Als in.\") The argument is that if the computer moves five times faster than you can point-andclick, it can be dumb and boring and still whip you every time. (Anyone remember the computer player in ARCHON?) While this may be true, I'd like to see the rule that states turnbased play guarantees quality Als! I've got one word for you on this concept... ASCENDANCY. Here was a turnbased game without even multiplayer capability-and lo and behold, not a competent Al to be found. Much the same thing could be said about the initial release of MASTER OF MAGIC. Sol think it's safe to say real-time is hardly a more substantial threat to challeng. ing wargames than short-sighted pro. ject managers. Now the other, more relevant prob lem some have with RT wargaming is You can't swing a dead PR rep without smacking a real-time My honest opinion is that real-time is far more realistic for wargames than this utterly artificial, you-move-l-move routine, which has been drilled into us because wargaming started on boards with no way to mimic time realistically. While I agree that the passage of time for decision-making is probably moot at the Corp or even Divisional level, once you get past that point I think turns are actually a bad thing for a wargame, as they foster the stunted, chess-like thinking that makes armchair-generals so bad at analyzing real combat. For a simulation to make any claims to realism, events must at least unfold at no slower than 1:1 time. Players should have the added tension that once they order that platoon to roll out, there is no calling it back into place without some muss and fuss. Traditional computer wargames could do worse than explore the realm of \"slow\" real-time and, while there is little doubt that STEEL PANTHERS is a better game than CLOSE COMBAT, I think it has less to do with turns and far more to do with Grigsby being the better designer. STEEL PANTHERS running in 1:1 time would be a real nail-biter, as well as the tactical mind-bender it is now. So in the end, I guess I do wish for the End of the Turn-Based Games as we know them, not because I am a twitch-reflex arcade twerp, but because the real world isn't polite enough to move in phases. wargame. countless hours they don't use for dating. While RT games are vulnerable to players who excel at the mechanics instead of the game, little changes in the code can prevent that from being a problem-things like competent Al for each piece, so they don't just stand around if you aren't there to command them, and a set up utility that sets the speed of the game at the beginning, displaying it as an initial game condition before others join in.
