As a result, the dark palette gives the screen a more gritty, realistic look and, as an added bonus, saves time in animating movement sequences. Using cinematic close-ups and cutscenes originated out of the team's desire to emphasize both characterization and action. Close-ups and cinematic camera angles enable the artists to bring out more emotion and feeling in the characters, giving the product more of a graphic novel than cartoon feel. Ironically, the use of cinematic cuts and angles has meant less gross animation work for the artists than in the older products, since many of the animated sequences of old were merely functional set-pieces to get the character from one A BRUTE, HIS BIKE AND HIS BROAD room to another.

"Illustration by Albert Slark Interactive he Star Trek game I really want to play has not been written yet. This is largely because holodecks haven't been invented yet. Let's face it until there's a game that can literally plop you down in Captain Kirk's command chair or maybe Picard's, it looks more comfortable), no Star Trek game will be completely satisfying. I, for one, am less interested in playing Star Trek than in living it. I want to feel the deck planks of the Enterprise shiver under the stresses of Warp 9 acceleration. I want to hold the compact weight of a communicator in my hand and hear it chirp as I flip open its lid. I want to deliver a Vulcan neck pinch. I want to open an overhead bin full of quadro-triticale and loose a torrent of tribbles upon my head. Somehow, seeing tribbles pile up inside a monitor just isn't the same. Unfortunately, short of landing a role in the new TV series (\"Star Trek: Voyager,\" scheduled to hit TV screens next year), I don't see how I'll have a chance to have any of these experiences in real life; and unless we are blessed with a sudden quantum leap forward in virtual reality technology, I wouldn't count on experiencing them in a simulation either, at least not any time too soon. Under the circumstances, Star Trek computer games offer the best alternative. Luckily for connoisseurs, Star Trek is in the midst of an unprecedented renaissance. Not only is there a new Trek film debuting at the box oflice and a pair of TV series in production (plus another pair cycling through what one imagines will be eternal re-runs), but more than half a dozen new pieces of Star Trek-related software have either just shown up at, or are on their way to, your neighborhood computer store. Even more exciting, the quality of these titles is consistently high, something that has not always been true of Star Trek games in the past. Whatever the reason-better technology, designers who know their source material and believe in being faithful to it, good luck—this year's crop offers both ardent and casual trekkers a richer harvest than any they've had to look forward to in the past quarter century.

"Enterprises by Charles Ardai ALL OUR YESTERDAYS The first Star Trek games, programmed in the 1970s, were very simple allairs: graphically bland exercises in navigation and combat set against the backdrop of a grid that was meant to stand in for outer space. In some you got to choose between playing a Federation ship or a Klingon ship; in others you had no say in the matter. Some offered gravitational threats, such as black holes, for added intrigue. Most just offered an inexhaustible supply of enemy ships to battle. There were no frills; the computers these games ran on didn't have enough memory for frills. Star Trek games entered the second phase of their development a decade later when two pop-culture phenomena happened to coincide: the release of Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979 and the videogame boom of the early 1980s. In 1982 GCE came out with a Star Trek cartridge for the Vectrex, their vector-graphics home videogame system. As in the earlier Trek games the theme was combat, but this time it was combat viewed from a first-person perspective rather than from overhead, in part, one assumes, because of the impact of the trench scene in \"Star Wars\" (which around the same time became a popular vector-graphics arcade game in its own right) and in part because of the success of Atari's seminal first-person space combat game, STAR RAIDERS. To spice things up, GCE threw in space stations for \"power link refueling\" and allowed players to avoid plasma bolts from attacking Klingons by throwing up ASTEROIDS-style shields, but there was no story to speak of and very little other than the logo splayed across the bottom of the screen to indicate to players that they were visiting the Star Trek universe. Nevertheless, the game was well received, getting kudos from most reviewers. In 1985, Simon & Schuster tried a different approach: they hired award-winning science fiction novelist Diane Duane to pen the script for a text-only adventure game called THE KOBAYASHI ALTERNATIVE. Duane delibcrately steered the game away from combat, positing an alternative test for Starfleet trainees to replace the Kobayashi Maru combat simulator shown at the beginning of \"Star Trek II.» Instead of rescuing a ship under attack, cadets would have to track down a ship that had vanished, the U.S.S.

This latest version offers a football-shaped cursor moving down a Green Bay-green playing field, albeit with one hash mark instead of two. Despite the attempt to breathe graphic life into the interface, it has an unfortunately clunky look and feel, making the game hard to get into.

Still, the sparse field of Astroturf green has a clean, uncluttered look which adds to play rather than getting in the way. The statistical accuracy is still the leader in this competitive genre, and the game system is a breeze to learn. All of the latest rules, formations and plays are included in a game that can be completed in under an hour. One great feature of the stat-based system is that historic teams, such as the undefeated 72 Dolphins, can be easily matched against current powerhouses. The season replay feature works the best of any we've seen. If this weren't enough, the game includes over 300 great pro and college teams, including obscure AFL, USFL and minor college teams.

While still basically a statbased game, the graphic overlays will make it accessible to the average game player. The formations seem fairly authentic, and the plays work as they should. Still, play selection seems limited, and it's hard to tell when the quarterback throws to a secondary receiver, or when a busted play results in a big gain, as often happens in actual competition. The touted Smart Coach Mode isn't the cuttingedge of Al technology, but it plays a fairly challenging game. Meanwhile, opponent tendencies are flashed on screen (the virtual Assistant Coach never rests, it seems). This is a good laptop game, with each team rated for injuries, penalties, and substitution tendencies.

SNEAK PREVIEW Game Still In Development ACH NEW AIR COMBAT SIMULATION TAKES US EVER CLOSER TO AN EXPERIENCE SO CONVINCING IT SEEMS REAL.. Flight models, graphics, and artificial intelligence continue to push the envelope of technological possibility within the constraints of conventional hardware. Simulations like Domark's pioneering FLIGHT SIM TOOLKIT (and its addons) showed what was considered impossible only a year ago—a 3D polygon-filled simulation running in high resolution (1024x768) at a fast frame rate on a 486 with 64-bit local bus graphics card. Additionally, sims like Origin's STRIKE COMMANDER and MicroProse's FLEET DEFENDER and 1942 PACIFIC AIR WAR demonstrate how texture mapping, even at low resolution, can transform crude shapes into sleek aircraft, life-like cock(SNE pits, and detailed targets and buildings. Now, with the advent of U.S. NAVY FIGHTERS (USNF) from Elec. tronic Arts, it is clear that a new generation of air combat simulations has arrived. One flight at the controls of an aircraft in the texture-mapped U.S. NAVY FIGHTERS in 640x480 resolution, and you'll never want to go back to low-res. The game's designer and 3D programming impresario Brent Iverson and producer Paul Grace are like the Sigfried and Roy of air combat simulation, performing feats of sheer magic with their products. Many of you may be familiar with this team's last product: Chuck YEAGER'S AIR COMBAT (YAC), which showed that a simulation could appeal to both hard-core types and novices alike. After co-authoring a book on YAC, I remember asking Iverson \"What's next?\" to which he replied in a low-key manner, \"I think I want to do something with modern naval aircraft.\" That was over two years ago, and since then, I've been dying to see what Iverson and Grace have been working on. It appears that the two have stayed on target and, by building upon what they learned from YAC, the pair set forth to create yet WYSIWYG A real F-18 about to hook the arresting gear (inset) looks almost as good as the aircraft simulated in U.S. Navy Fighters.

Additionally, the two most useful items are the RWR (Radar Warning Receiver) and an over-simplified radar. Anyone overwhelmed in F-14 FLEET DEFENDER will welcome this, but the serious sim driver may miss a comprehensive radar display. The tracking view is the easiest to use of any flight sim I've seen. They've taken the \"floating X» that designates targets from YAC and combined it with a tracking \"padlock» type view. If you designate a target and he flies out of your field of view, you'll see an X. Fly the X to the center and apply backpressure, and you'll bring the target right into your view; subsequently, your HUD will come into your field of view (simulating bringing the nose of the aircraft up to the target), where you'll be able to bring your weapons to bear.

I'm closeI can see tracers passing between his wing and tailplane—but somehow, no cigar. Finally, I get angry. I pour on the coals, get close, throttle back, and fire from 40 yards-he jerks away from the tracer passing right in front of his cockpit and does a falling leaf, neatly sliding below my nose. I dive after him, and the whole dance begins again-up, down, left, right. In spite of full flaps, the Cat stalls when I'm firing at him from maybe 40 feet away, and it is only when I'm diving that I discover I'm at 400 feet. If it weren't for flaps... I pull out just in time to see a parachute opening; the smoking Zero, still doing the falling leaf, goes into the drink. Number six. Or did someone damage him more badly than I did? At the debriefing, it turns out he's mine, all right. Six kills—and the Navy Cross, plus promotion to Ensign. That makes it 20 kills in eight sorties, my best Wildcat performance so far.

"wargaming hobby of ours to those who know nothing of it but who only assumed the worst of us, well... I've earned my scars in those debates and am proud of them. I still want to be called a \"wargamer.\" Knowing the lessons of history that wargamers learn, and our studied appreciation for the losses that war's produce, I'm proud to be counted among the wargamers, first and foremost (although that doesn't stop me from playing card games with my wife and son). Were I in the armed forces, I would prefer to be called a \"soldier,\" not a \"peace keeper.\" I really wouldn't want that kind of euphemistic job title, just as I don't want to be known as a \"strategy gamer\" in preference to being a \"wargamer.\" And while I'll read GameFix, playing and enjoying both the war and strategy games in it, just don't forget that I'm a wargamer first and foremost. Now, where's my silver helmet? I feel a need to do my Patton imitation... G-2 (continued from page 203) And while I'm still on the subject of the purity of wargaming, one product to keep an eye out for is QQP'S THE PURE WARGAME. The first installment will cover airborne operations during WWII, but this appears to be only the beginning of a series of operational level wargames. While QQP has done many fine, abstract, military-oriented games (such as THE PERFECT GENERAL), this one is targeted at history lovers. Those less historically inclined can look for BATTLES IN TIME, an abstract strategy/wargame of the future, and QQP's computer translation of the fine, chess-like boardgame CONQUEST.

Planning a successful defense is a tough but rewarding job. Usually the defender is outnumbered, sometimes badly, and there never seems to be enough artillery to go around. Our analysis of the scenario includes an accepted risk in the far north area of the map. An enemy thrust along this route would require a tank movement to the northern plateau to counter it. Our final lesson then, is that planning not only brings risk, but also requires that you respond to the enemy. While it won't guarantee victory, sound planning based on the four steps listed above, will both minimize risks and increase your options in dealing with bold maneuvers from large enemy forces. Good luck—and good defense. Gregory M. Smith had over 12 years experience as an Armor officer with the US Army, serving as a tank platoon leader, XO and company commander.

Q.Q.Pos Strategies of the Month For an interesting and often winning game of Grandest Fleet, try a lopsided fleet set-up. What I mean by lopsided is that your initial fleet would consist of 80% subs or 85% carriers or 90% cruisers. You will be amazed at what can happen with this type of set-up, cruisers especially, have a lot of fire power for their relatively low buy points. A lopsided set-up will prove challenging and usually a lot of fun. If you choose mostly subs, for instance, they will be deadly and stealthy, but you must carefully plan your moves to stay away from ships most destructive to subs. Go for it!! You will be intrigued. In the random maps, don't shy away from the small maps. They may not be the big macho game that the humongus maps render, but these small ones are challenging, especially at the higher levels. In any of the random maps start with one, possibly two, strong bases of operation and strike out offensively from there. It is very tempting to spread your forces over the map to get those victory points quickly. My suggestion is, don't spread out. Have that big attack fleet (or 2) and roll over your opponent. If you don't use bombers use bombers!! They are infininitly valuable. a) To reinforce an offensive, b) Help defend a thin defense, c) Bombard enemy towns, and d) To keep your opponent constantly off guard.

But when discussions with Lucas Film went nowhere (they had other plans, apparently), Roberts decided to create his own grand-sweeping space conflict. Replacing stormtroopers and Imperial pilots with warmongering felines, and X-wings and TIE fighters with ships of his own design, Roberts beat LucasArts to the space-conflict punch and created WING COMMANDER, one of the most popular games of all time. Although it is rare for CGW to induct a sequel into the Hall of Fame (Origin's ULTIMA games being the only exceptions), we couldn't deny WING COMMANDER II: VENGEANCE OF THE KILRATHI its much earned honor. WING COMMANDER did everything the original did, only better by tenfold. The wrist-wracking action got more wristwracking, with improved enemy pilots (although they were still somewhat predictable). The cinematic cut scenes took on greater prominence, accentuating the dark and deep storyline. The sound eflects were so well done and integral to the game that they inspired many gamers to try out their first sound card. Now, the gaming world awaits WING COMMANDER III, a game that, with its Hollywood talent and redesigned polygon-based graphics engine, could be the next \"star wars\" sensation. NOVEMBER 1994.
