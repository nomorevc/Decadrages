"The #1 Computer Game Magazine LETTERS computer Gaming Vorld BLADE BUMMER There was one game noticeably absent from your Holiday I lot 100 Buyers Guide: BLADE RUNNER. I was wondering if there was any reason why it didn't even make the \"honorable mention\" section. Jeremy Joyner from the Internet ULTIMA OVERLOOKED? Your December Buyers Guide had no mention of ULIMA ONLINE! I have been a reader of CGW for several years and find the Buyer's Guide a valuable tool for keeping me aware of the games that are worth purchasing, but you seemed to have missed mentioning one of the biggest advances in gaming technology in a long time. Steve Wetzel from the Internet Funny you should notice-Westwood did too! The reason we didn't include BLADE RUNNER IS because none of our editors were able to play a portion of the game by December press time. We wanted to include only those games we could play and were confident would ship on time. However, by the January issue, we were able to play the game and we were sure it would ship by Christmas, so we included it in the Holiday Gift Guide (CCW #162, page 72). It's nice to have been in error about a ship chate on the positive side for a change There's no question that ULTIMA ONLINE is breaking new ground and is worthy of coverage Indeed, we have written about the game numerous times over the course of its development However, our Buyer's Guide was strictly for games we could wholeheartedly recommend. ULTIMA ONLINE, in the version we played was so unstable, buggy, and unbalanced, that despite its potential-ive simply could not recommend it. For a better description of those problems, see our review in this issue. LETTER OF THE MONTH APACHE UPRISING I just finished reading the November 1997 issue of CGW, and I was a little upset with a comment made in the \"Longbow Restrung\" article. Before I continue, let me address the history of rivalry between the different aircraft associated with the United States Army. Ever since the Vietnam conflict, when the Army realized that it needed to have different aircraft for different missions, pilots of each type of aircraft have claimed to be the \"best\" Army pilot, regardless of aircraft or mission. Since I am an AH-64A Apache pilot recently back from a tour in Bosnia, I took some offense to the comment that the Kiowa Warrior was more suited to recon than an AH64. It was claimed that because it has a nose-mounted TADS, the Longbow must be completely exposed to use the system.\" As all Apache pilots and, I'm sure, many computer gamers know, employing your equipment to exploit its strengths is integral to winning the battle. The easy method of laterally unmasking prevents exposing the entire aircraft. Simply put, poke the nose of the aircraft out from behind some trees perpendicular to where you wish to see, then orient the TADS 90 degrees to either side and take a look for yourself. This method exposes only the nose of the aircraft, which isn't much more than a TADS on a Kiowa. As with most equipment, whether computer-generated or real, knowing it intimately is key to employing it properly. Brian C.

"READ.ME PIPELINE We're Not Dead Yet! * Dear Mout But Recent Moves Suggest That 7th Level Is in Need of Some Life Support ath Level shocked the gaming industry recently with the announcement that its highly successful Monty Python game line was on the selling block. The news came just a few months after lon Storm's acquisition of 7th Level's real-time strat egy game, DOMINION (along with its designer, Todd Porter). All this activity left 7th Level with just one major gaming title, RETURN TO KRONDOR, the role play ing game by best-selling science-fiction fantasy author Raymond Feist, and the true sequel to Sierra On-Line's acclaimed BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR. All was revealed at Comdex, where 7th Level made yet another announcement--that it had acquired Pulse Entertainment, developers of adventure game BAD Mojo and the upcoming 3D shooter SPACE BUNNIES MUST DIE. The two companies have merged management and operations to form a new company called P7 Solutions. P7 will no longer publish games, and will instead focus on Internet solutions. So what about the games? Well, Take 2 Interactive, publishers of Ripper, the upcoming BLACK DAHLIA, and the JET FIGHTER series, acquired distribution rights to all the Monty Python titles, then immediately sold all American distribution rights to Panasonic Interactive Media. Take 2 retains the European distribution rights. The latest title in the Monty Python series, THE MEANING OF LIFE, a strategy adventure game containing previously unreleased film footage and new dialogue from all the original cast members, is still scheduled for a December release. As for the Pulse titles, the members of the SPACE BUNNIES Must Die production team have formed a new company. Jinx, and will con tinue to work on the product. According to Jinx CEO Vinny Carrella, Ripcord (a division of Panasonic Interactive Media) and P7, which are both minority shareholders in Jinx, have been very supportive in helping the company get off the ground. Carrella is enthusiastic about the new move: \"It's like moving out of your parents' house for the first time-it's really scary, but it's also really exciting.\" Plans for Ripcord to publish SPACE BUNNIES are still going ahead, and the game is set to meet its summer 1998 schedule. And, in a surprise move, Sierra announced that it had acquired Pyro Technix from 7th Level, bringing the KRONDOR series back into the fold. Sierra Northwest, the company's Seattle-based development division, is working with Raymond Feist and Pyro Technix, and the company anticipates a late 1998 release for the game.

As with many other arcade shooters, SWIV offers a variety of power-ups to make your vehicle tougher, faster, and the like. The game also has 3Dfx-acceleration, and the terrain looks nice. Ultimately, though, SWIV is a simple shoot'em-up that offers nothing truly groundbreaking to the genre.

"READ.ME Introducing the next step in the evolution of action strategy gaming.. Empire Joins the Golf Wars With a Strong Contender X Multiple Views X Multiplayer X Multiple Sides x Full 3D X Intuitive Interface X Intelligence Warfare from the producer of mpire Interactive has devised a new way for PC golfers to whack their balls. Dubbed the MouseDrive, Empire's star creation promises a more natural, real-time alternative to the genre's traditional double or triple-click swing meter. In fact, Empire is so convinced that you'll love the MouseDrive, they've purposely omitted a swing meter alternative-a move they may regret if players don't take to the new swing mechanic. To use MouseDrive, players simply pull back on the mouse for backswing, then push forward for the drive. Sideways movement on the followthrough creates hooks or slices. According to Empire, the realtime interactivity of the MouseDrive makes it possible to achieve highly technical shots, from low drives into strong winds to draws, fades, and deep bunker explosions. The free-form mechanics of MouseDrive also require the use of 12,000 frames of animation to represent more than 90 possible swing variations, Practice greens and an interactive tutorial hosted by Gary Player are In the Works available to help newcomers master these advanced techniques. Two 18-hole courses ship with the game: South Carolina's Hilton Head National, and the Jack Nicklaus-designed St. Mellion International in Cornwall, England. Every inch of each course was surveyed, then height-mapped with SGI workstations. The game incorporates actual turf, trees, and hazards into the course design. The results are extremely photorealistic when viewed at 640x480 at 256 colors. The courses are further enhanced with light-source shading and detailed texture-mapping. The digitized golfers are also exceptionally well drawn. Video captured at an incredible 200 frames per second, the onscreen animation is fluid and lifelike. Most amazing, however, is the golfers' realistic interaction with the course graphics. In most other sims, golfers stand flat-footed, regardless of the terrain. In GOLF PRO, onscreen golfers strike a more realistic stance that is determined by the lay of the ball in relation to turf inclines or proximity to course obstacles. For example, a ball played on the edge of a steep bunker might require that the golfer stand with one leg higher and knee bent. This is one of those small details that you never miss until you see it implemented for the first time. Game styles include match, stroke, and tournament play, with a progressive handicapping system that automatically adjusts as your play improves. Though it's not clear from the prerelease information, Empire hints that you can also compete with professionals such as Player, Nicklaus, and Tom Watson in recorded play from actual tournaments. Other features not available for preview include a 5,000 word shot-by-shot commentary, and \"Play with the Pro,\" an interactive analysis of your golfing techniques, coached by Player. Multiplayer games support up to eight players via modem, network, or play by email. It should be interesting to see if sim-golfers embrace Empire's MouseDrive. Even without such innovation, THE GOLF Pro looks to be another strong contender in this red-hot sports genre. -Scott May ' X-Wingh and Tie-Fighter and the designer of The Super Star Wars Trilogy\" COMMAND The war begins February 1998 RODENT POWER Empire is so confident you'll love its new MouseDrive swing mechanic, THE GOLF PRO doesn't even offer a traditional alternative. The game also features stunning high-resolution SGI-rendered graphics and multiplay for up to eight players via modem or network connection.

"COVER STORY: DIABLO II Developer: Blizzard North  Publisher: Blizzard Target Release Date: Winter 1997-98 DIA VOF W IABLO's gothic images of perdition masterfully condemned gamers to its dark, rich mythological world. They gladly \"sold their souls\" to the tune of more than a million copies. We editors even named it Computer Gaming World's 1996 Game of the Year Yet, there were those who weighed this rare game in the balance and found it wanting. Some claimed it to be a dumbed-down role-playing game. Others dismissed it as a mere sophisticated action game, a new Rogue or GAUNTLET. Though it reinvigorated the role-playing market, many criticized it for not being a true RPG. Others objected to Blizzard's lack of foresight regarding cheating on battle.net. To the multiplayer fans, Blizzard has promised to fix the cheating problem in DIABLO II. To those who complain about Diablo's lack of RPG purity, the design team offers no quarter. Says Blizzard's David Brevik, \"We didn't make an RPG, we made DIABLO.\" For the sequel, the Blizzard team hopes to keep DIABLO's fun hackand-slash experience while expanding and improving the game. They don't want to appease hard-core RPG fans by adding artificial NPC interactions—they want to maintain the flavor of the original but they also don't want DIABLO II to be just more of the same. After talking to the Blizzard team, it's clear that they're determined to create a more immersive by Elliott Chin Rogues Gallery CORRUPTED ROGUER CGW FEBRUARY 1998 "


"BLO'S BACK AND HE'S MAD AS HELL! Get the Scoop on His Next Reign of Terror experience with new characters, monsters, spells, and locations while producing a true sequel with a twist. Diabolical Plan The twist is that the story is told and experienced from a new hero's perspective. None of the heroes from DIABLO return, and at the start of the game, even Diablo's whereabouts are unknown. The hero from the first game, after containing Diablo's spirit and journeying to the East, Succumbed to the more powerful will of the Lord of Terror. Now, Diablo is free from his entrapment below Tristram and has assumed his original appearance, but with much greater power. As the game begins, he is somewhere in the East, raising an army to conquer not just one city, but a whole game world. Building Character There are no rogues, warriors, or sorcerers to play in DIABLO II. The Lord of Terror is mightier than ever, and the previous game's heroes simply aren't up to the challenge. So Blizzard has created five new character classes. One, the Amazon, is a cross between the rogue and warrior, with superior melee and range attacks. Her main attacks make use of either the bow or spear. She will have five levels of abilities, each more powerful than the last. You can see some of the proposed abilities in the box below. These aren't all of her abilities, and in fact, she won't be able to learn all of them. You'll have to pick from among the total number, meaning that gamers will be able to customize unique characters. You might specialize in the spear, while your friend specializes in the bow. For other characters' abilities, see the sidebar on page 81. The Amazon's Special Abilities Level SEN Ellect Vital shot (bow) Slower but more damaging shot Jab (spear) Faster, but slightly less powerful attack True alm (bow) More accurate, but slower shot Entangle (spaar) Temporarily paralyzes target INTO THE DARKNESS Blizzard is striving to increase realism with improved lighting erects3 Safe shot (bow) Fire into melee without hitting friends and visibility based on line of sight.

"DIABLO II monastery and free the Sisters. When you defeat Andariel in the town's final dungeon level, you'll move on to subsequent acts and locales in the East. Hell's Kitchen The action in DIABLO Il proceeds through four acts, with each act comprising a town and its accom panying dungeons. Each act will also tell a little more about Diablo's origins and plans, which include freeing his brothers, Baal and Mephisto (Together they form the triumvirate known as the Prime Evils.) As the game's hero, you will have to track Diablo through each act and town and try to prevent him from raising his army. Your hero comes into the game as a powerful adventurer who has heard of the Lord of Terror's renewed rampage. No one from the original DIABLO can help you. Since the heroes of the first game were too weak to defeat DIABLO completely, the sequel calls for all-new adventurers. As a character from one of five new class es, you start out in the mountains at the Sisters of the Sightless Eye monastery DIABLO fans will recall that the rogue character belonged to the Sisters order. Blizzard envisions new players beginning the game here, where they'll discover that the monastery has been taken over by a tremendous evil power. The Lesser Evil Andariel, a demon from Hell, is hoping to curry favor with Diablo by conscripting the rogues into her evil army. Andariel soon corrupts all the captured rogues, but a small band of survivors forms around the monastery, creating a makeshift camp and DIABLO II's first town. You'll need to uncover Andariel's hand in the fall Will It Be a True RPG? One of CGW's criticisms of DIABLO was that the town and nonplayer characters (NPCs) seemed too artificial and static: The streams never moved in Tristram: the NPCs were nailed to the floor; they \"gave\" you items by hurling them to the ground; and there were no ambient noises or background action. In addition, the role-playing experiences for each character class weren't very distinct. Although Brevik says that Blizzard never set out to make DIABLO a hardcore role playing game, they do want to make DIABLO II a better role. playing experience. The develop ment team recognizes that the char. acters in the original game were too much alike, distinguished only by their weapons and character attributes. In light of this, the team is endeavoring to strengthen the game's RPG qualities in three ways: They want to make the towns more alive, integrate the NPCs further into the quests and story, and make the playing experience for each character class very different To make the towns more realistic, the Blizzard team plans to add plenty of animation, including moving water in streams, occasional flocks of birds, and NPCs walking in the background. Each town will have a unique cast of supporting NPCs, and these NPCs will have a wider range of motions. You'll see them moving about, le caught up with David Brevik, the president of Blizzard North, to ask about the changes coming to DIABLO II. Here, we've excerpted a few questions from our interview. But if you want to hear more from Brevik including his thoughts on DIABLO's place as a \"real\" RPG, nonhuman characters in DIABLO II, and cheatingread the full interview at www. computergaming.com. the CGW: How is DIABLO II different from the first game? Brevik: DIABLO II is a ground-up reinvention of DIABLO. From a technical standpoint, we have restructured the game to run more efficiently, with better lighting and special effects. And, of course, we've addressed the cheating issue. From a gameplay standpoint, Rogues' Gallery ANDARIEL The most powerful of the Lesser Evils, Andariel hopes to gain the Three's lavor by enslaving the monastery residents and making them her army.

"DIABLO II we have made the DIABLO universe much larger, with more varied experiences for the players. We want the players to feel totally immersed in the world of DIABLO, which means more varied tasks, more interesting NPCs, smarter foes, and more options for the player. CGW: Will you meet any rogues, sorcerers, or warriors in DIABLO II? Brevik: Players will encounter rogues, sorcerers, and warriors during the game as NPCs and hired characters. GW: Why is Blizzard North remaking everything-from character classes to monstersin DIABLO II? Brevik: We wanted to give players an allnew experience. We will keep a few of the monsters, such as skeletons and zombies, in some form, but they will have new AI, abilities, and weapons. I would say players can expect to see maybe 5 or 10 percent of the monsters from DIABLO....In regard to spells, we will keep probably about 10 percent of the spells.

Each class will also be customizable, because not every player will be able to mas ter the fighting moves of every class. Two players could thus create characters of the same class but with very different fighting abilities (see the two character sidebars, pages 69 and 81).

There will now be five classes-two spell-casters, two fighters, and one hybridand each will play differently. The attributes list will stay the same, but combat will change. While spellcasters will have a melee weapon and a range of spells, fighters will have a repertoire of fighting moves that will rival the mage spells for diversity. These moves will, in effect, replace spells for these melee charac ters. (The fighters will be able to cast a few spells, but only through the use of scrolls or staves.) The hybrid class should have a mix of spells and fighting moves.

Blizzard has also implemented true transparencies (rather than dithering) when a character walks behind a wall. Characters will now enjoy true line-ofsight.

"The Ultimate Game Machine, Part III WE THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE by Loyd Case echnology is the supercharged element of computer gaming. Two years ago, CGW's first «Ultimate Game Machine\" was a Pentium 133MHz, and the Pentium 166 was just around the corner. This year's UGM has more than twice the clock speed and fast, beautiful graphics-the kind that could only be seen on workstations two years ago. Not only that, but today we can build a budget system that nearly doubles the performance of that 1995 Ultimate System for less than half the price. Clearly, our kind of heavy metal has a one-year half-life. That being the case, we offer this series for those who need to make changes to keep up with the latest game, releases. Our goal for this year's build-your-own seg ment was fourfold. First, we wanted to build the ultimate game machine with money being no object. Hey, this is a gaming magazine, so why not have some fun? Second, we wanted to build a screamer box for a price point of $2,500 (we do, after all, live in the real world). Third, we wanted to offer a low-budget alternative with respectable performance for less than $1,500. Finally, for those who don't want or need to build a new system, we wanted to offer upgrade strategies to improve your components. You may not agree with all of our selections. Even so, they are best-of-breed componentsand they would be good candidates for upgrading any system. Still, let us know what your favorite choices are, because we'll be updating the Ultimate Game Machine compo nents each month online. Let's get nuclear... FEBRUARY 1998 CGW "


"PLUTONIUM POWERED PCS magine, for a moment, that you had deep pockets, and could indulge your every whim in building a thermonuclear gaming rig. What would it look like? We like to keep the perspective on gaming. For example, several people suggested that we pick the Fujitsu Plasmavision 42-inch, flat-panel display. We considered it, but there are problems with flat-panel displays for gaming. For one thing, switching resolutions tends to result in either shrunken or ugly images. This is, after all, the Ultimate Game Machine, not the ultimate workstation or the ultimate home theater. pentium I intel. STILL THE ONE Though AMD and Cyrix are working on improving their floating-point performance, the Pentium Il remains the champion of the day. The Core There are six components that make up the core of a PC: the processor, the motherboard, the memory, the case and power supply, the CD-ROM drive, and the floppy drive. We'll give you a quick dilemma. Luckily, we were able to take advantage of some lowered prices, so the Heavy Metal is still a Pentium II, but at 233MHz. explain our choices. For the purposes of this article, we'll call the high-end system the Meltdown and the midrange system Heavy Metal. (The $1,500 system follows in a sidebar on page 112.) Processor in the last few months, we took a look at a lot of CPU alternatives. Cyrix was out, even on the budget box. It just didn't deliver the goods for highperformance gaming. There's a myth that having a fast 3D accelerator neutralizes the Pentium II's floating point advantage, but it's just that: a myth. You still need to generate the polygons and do the lighting transforms and the geometry-and that takes serious floating point performance. AMD was a more interesting choice, but we didn't have a chance to look at one of the new VIA equipped AGP Socket 7 motherboards, so it's also out. The AMD chip is more of a consideration if your budget is very, very tight, although it's still not as good a floating point performer as the Intel line (as our 3D WinBench tests last summer indicated). For the Meltdown machine, the CPU choice was a no-brainer: the 300MHz Pentium II. The Heavy Metal's CPU proved more of a Motherboard Motherboards are a critical part of any system. Low-ball motherboards can actually hurt system performance-or result in flaky behavior. Nothing ruins an immersive experience more than getting dumped out of the game with a \"blue screen of death\" error. Motherboard technology is rapidly evolving. Microsoft, Intel, and Compaq are busy getting out the PC 98 specification, which will complete. ly reshape PC systems, and the use of FireWire (IEEE 1394) for mass storage and USB for key. boards, mice, and controllers will reshape the way systems are configured. Until then, though, systems integration is still something of a puzzle. For once, we were able to ride the technology curve on our motherboard choices. Both sys. tems use ATX-format, AGP boards using Intel's 440LX chipset. When moving to ATX for mat motherboards, you'll have the abili ty to shut down your YAM G ece W DE 138 MEN W WHERE #418718 adaptec SUPERE 8 181RESOBRE IR EERSTEUNER RETRE PODL * omniu 8131818 181 MENTOR 8 1818181 ONE FAST MOTHER: Board, that is. The Supermicro PODLS' second Slot 1 CPU interface leaves your machine with room to grow. BERNER B RRR "


"64MB of Crucial Technologies 10 nanosecond (ns) SDRAM-more than enough memory for just about any gaming need today. The 10ns speed of the SDRAM isn't fully used by the 440LX chipset, which still only runs a 66MHz system clock. Sometime in early to mid-1998, expect to see systems with 100MHz system clocks as a matter of course. The Heavy Metal uses a single 32MB SDRAM DIMM, leaving two empty slots for future memory expansion. If One CPU Is Good.. whole system from Windows. Although it cuts the slot count to seven, ATX has pretty much become the standard. It offers better cooling and good support for full-sized expansion cards. The new LX chipset is somewhat faster than the older 440FX chipset, and it supports SDRAM and UltraDMA/33 hard drives. The Meltdown uses Supermicro's P6DLS mainboard, which is actually a dual-processor board, but we used just a single CPU, since Windows 95 can use only one processor. However, when NT 5.0 ships, with full DirectX and multiprocessor support, we can add a second CPU. The Supermicro board is a little rough around the edges-documentation is pretty skimpy-but it's kind of like the difference between a Dodge Viper and a Mustang 5.0 liter. We know which one's faster. The Heavy Metal uses the very nice, easy to set up, ASUS P2L97 AGP motherboard. This puppy has one AGP slot, five PCI slots (yes five), and a pair of ISA slots (one ISAIPCI pair is shared). The Pentium II slides neatly into the Slot 1 socket on the board. Early versions of this board had the ability to set the CPU clock in the BIOS, but alas, the new versions have returned to jumpers for speed setting. One minor downside to this board is that the location of the connector strip for the power switch and reset button prevents you from installing a long ISA card in the last slot, defeating (in part) the advantage of the ATX format. POINT OF FACT Windows 95 can support only a single CPU, but DirectX is also migrating to Windows NT, which supports multiple CPUs; it can't hurt to have an extra slot. Memory One surprise you'll run into when configuring memory is that the form factor is changing once again. All of the new motherboards we looked at had only DIMM sockets. All those 72-pin SIMMs you've invested in can now be used to mark your place in the 688(1) manual. Most DIMMS these days are SDRAM, although you can find EDO DIMMs. Unless you have a burning need for parity modules, SDRAM seems to be the way to go. We've heard rumors of parity SDRAM, but haven't seen it yet. As for ECC (error-correcting) memory modules, don't bother unless you're doing something mis. sion critical. ECC actually results in a minor performance hit. The rule of thumb for memory is this: Get what you can afford. Since we didn't have a budget for the Meltdown, we dropped in any people are thinking about multiprocessing these days. In fact, this year's Ultimate Game Machine has a dual CPU motherboard, although it uses only a single CPU (for the time being). Windows 95 is part of the problem. Windows 95 (and Windows 98, for that matter) will support only a single CPU. Adding another one would be a waste. However, DirectX 6.0 will be fully integrated into Windows NT 5.0, and NT has supported multiprocessing for several revisions now-the thought of a pair of 300MHz processors has our mouths watering in the most Pavlovian sense. But there's a downside to using any version of NT: Older Win 95 games may not run, even with DirectX support, and DOS games almost certainly won't run. For the most obsessive gamer, the solution is to have a dual-boot NT 5.0/Windows 98 setup. This will probably be the hot ticket for the high-end gamer by the end of '98. After all, it's only disk space. FEBRUARY 1998 CGW "

"PLUTONIUM POWERED PCs Hard Drive: Speed Without Compromise Case and Power Supply The power supply is PC Power & Cooling's Turbocool 300 ATX, which delivers rock-solid power and reliably high current-loads. The Meltdown's case comes from the folks at JDR Microdevices. About an inch taller than last year's case, it has the removable motherboard tray and lots of internal expansion. It also has slots to install a muffin fan o uson FlashPoint bl FashPoint LTE or the Meltdown, we wanted speed without compromise. The obvious choice here was Seagate's Cheetah 10,000RPM, Ultra-Wide SCSI hard drive. It then occurred to us that if one Cheetah is good, two must be better. Scouting around, we came across Mylex's Flashpoint DW, which is an Ultra-Wide, dual-channel, SCSI host adapter with built in support for RAID 0 and RAID 1. RAID 1 is of no interest for gaming-who needs redundant data storage for LONGBOW 2? But if you've ever waited for 1F-22 to load, a speedy hard drive seems less of a luxury and more of a necessity. So we used the Flashpoint host adapter and a pair of 4.5GB Cheetahs to create a single RAID Ee29 O volume, which stripes data across two drives (in 64KB increments, in our case). In effect, you're using two drives as a single drive, doubling the width of the data path. It doesn't really double Flashlift throughput, but it does speed things up a lot. For example, a single Cheetah gets around 1,700 on WinBench 97's RAID ON Mylex's DW (top right), part of Business Disk WinMark, whereas the its Flashpoint family, allows you to stripe dual Cheetahs configured as a RAID 0 multiple drives as a single volume. device punch the result to a shade over 2,000. Two Cheetahs run a tad warm. Okay, they're hotter than a nuclear rod, but that's why we have a case that has a cooling fan blowing right across the hard drive slots. Another downside is that if one drive fails, you lose everything. The hard drive for the Heavy Metal is slightly more conservative: Seagate's new 7,200RPM UltraDMA/33. This baby is backward compatible with EIDE, but the 7,200RPM rotational speed really kicks in with UltraDMA/33's 33MB/sec burst. transfer rate. It also sports an access time of under 10ms. With a whopping 6.4GB of storage, it's no slouch in the capacity department, either. It uses technologies such as magnetoresistive heads to cram data into as few platters as possible. You gotta love that MORE POWER, SCOTTY Be sure your power supply is rated to at least 230 watts. that can blow air across the hard drive-essential cooling for the drives we chose. We found a case/power supply combo for the Heavy Metal at a local clone shop for only $79. It has a 230-watt power supply and a slideout motherboard tray. It's even slightly larger than most midsize towers. The shop couldn't tell us the manufacturer, but these kinds of cases are widely available; we recommend you get an ATX case with at least 230 walls of power. SPIN CITY Seagate's latest 6.4GB UltraDMA/33 drive will also keep things moving aloog CD-ROM Drives At the high end, once again, there's no contest.

"PLUTONIUM POWERED PCS How We Tested This year, we tested the roll-your-own systems in much the same way that we tested the off the shelf systems. These tests included WinBench 97, 3D WinBench 97, CBench, and a slew of games. To test 3D performance, we used FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98, GL QUAKE, WIPEOUT XL and Moto RACER. We tested Windows DirectDraw performance by running WINQUAKE with the nowindirect option. For DOS games, we used QUAKE and DUKE NUKEM 3D. We enabled FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98's frame-rate counter by pressing the Shift key and the letter Z twice in succession (Shift-ZZ). We cap. tured the frame rate at the start of the built-in FS98 features video, but it's best to watch the whole playback. FS98 is finicky about MIP-mapping, so you can see all kinds of interesting behavior with some cards.

"\"framerate\" at the race screen. Moto RACER is more complex. You need to have the Delphine-manufactured version (blue CD), not the Electronics Arts-manufactured version (white CD). Enable the frame counter by starting the game from a Dos window and typing \"moto ijklmnop\". When in a race screen, hit Shift-F1 (function key 1). The frame rate we published was at the opening of the default race. We took all the QUAKE Numbers by averaging the results of TimeDemos 1, 2, and 3. We set the resolution to 640x480, with the status bar visible, but the screen otherwise maximized. We ran DUKE NUKEM 3D by typing \"duke3dem-s3-1\" at the DOS prompt, then typing DNRATE after Duke's ship crashes.

With a minimum 14x CD speed, 20MB/sec over the Ultra-SCSI interface, and a sub-90ms access time, this drive's perfor mance approaches that of some hard drives. The Heavy Metal's CD-ROM drive is the Goldstar CR-8241B EIDE CD-ROM drive. It's a slot-loading drive, only costs $90 by mail order, has a 90ms access time, and scores over 1,300 on ZD's WinBench CD-ROM test. It supports Mode 2 DMA, reducing the CPU utilization to 16 percent-not bad for an IDE CDROM drive. gave the STB card the nod for our big rig. The RIVA 128 chip on the Velocity 128 is CPU-constrained. Even a 300MHz CPU can't deliver enough polygons to stress the RIVA's rendering ability. But the RIVA 128 chip isn't enough. There are still a lot of games written only for 3Dfx. Since money was no object, we picked a Quantum 3D Obsidian 100SB, which is a 3Dfx board. The 100SB is a new version of the two-board setup used in Falcon Northwest's premier Mach V system. With the lower-cost rig, we still wanted a really hot graphics subsystem-and, surpris. ingly, we didn't have to compromise much. The primary (AGP) card is the ASUS 3Dexplorer.

At the time we tested it, the DirectX drivers were still a little unstable, but GL QUAKE's performance was nothing short of incredible. With a little tweak ing, it posted over 70 frames per second (fps). Watching the benchmark time demos using the 3D Obsidian 100SB was like watching an old Keystone Kops movie. We would have liked to look at an AGP card using Rendition's new V2200 chip, but products weren't available in time. CE BEPUREJD panel. Nonetheless, we still wanted a 3Dfx card, and that was an easy choice: the Canopus Pure3D. One of the interesting points of the 440LX chipset was supposed to be its improved throughput. This may well be, but the DOS graphics performance we saw initially looked weak, despite the strong VGA-graphics core of the RIVA 128. The issue with the Pentium II. as with last year's Pentium Pro, is throughput. The Pentium Il is capable of write posting, lin. ear frame buffer (LFB) write combining, and banked VGA-graphics write combining. These features enable the Pentium II to pump VGAgraphics data over the PCI bus in big bursts, rather than in small driblets. Unfortunately, the ASUS motherboard has no way of turning on these features, so we had to resort to that old standby, FastVid. The AMI BIOS on the Supermicro board is a tweaker's delight. All the features needed to boost DOS graphics perfor mance could be set in the BIOS.

"PLUTONIUM POWERED PCS Backup IVIonitor Of course, you need a monitor to be able to see the games. This was one of our tough est choices. At first, flat-panel options seemed intriguing, but we discarded that idea after determining that all of them still have a fixed pixelcount. If you've ever seen a 1024x768 flat-panel display interpolate pixels to handle a 640x480 game, you know what we mean. \"Ugly\" doesn't begin to cover it. A flat panel needs to be built with a fixed number of pixels. If you have a flat panel that can handle high resolutions (1024x768, say). then one of two things will happen when it shifts to 640x480. Either you'll get a very small 640x480 image in the center of the flat panel, or it will sum real pixels to make ugly, large ones. The next option we looked at was one of those really big CRTS, such as the Mitsubishi 37-inch. This was pretty intriguing, but we sit close to the monitor with keyboard, mouse, and controllers when we play. Sit down a foot away from one of these big screens and it feels like you are craning your neck the whole time. We then went to a conventional 21-inch monitor. Here, there are several choices. We flirted briefly with the Mitsubishi 91TXM. It's a very nice, aperture grill monitor with a.28-inch stripe pitch. But we then saw a 24-inch (22.5-inch displayable) Sony GDM-W900. ames don't need to be backed up, but backing up your Windows system and any other useful data is a very good idea. Tape back up is tedious at best, so we popped in Syquest's Syjet 1.5, a 1.5GB, removable hard drive that makes backups a snap. a good computer. Moto RACER has a 16:9 option for its gameplay, but it really doesn't look that great. I'm aware of no other game that supports 16:9 or 16:10. We were about to drop the W900 from our list, when a friend came over and sat in front of the screen. \"I want this monitor!\" he exclaimed in an awestruck voice. That was all the justification we needed. As for our Heavy Metal rig, we really wanted to get a 17-inch monitor, and so we settled on the Optiquest 071 (Optiquest is Viewsonic's budget line). It's a nice monitor, though the clicking of the electromechanical relay when it's switching resolutions is a little disconcerting. The picture is sharp, but the onscreen controls are not very intuitive. Still, it's fairly bright, has a.28mm dot pitch and costs only $450. The W900 is really designed for CAD or desktop publishing. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio, mean. ing that it's wider than a conventional monitor (HDTV is 16:9; normal computer CRTs are 4:3). At first, we were still a little reluctant. There's a visible blank area on either side of the picture when running at standard resolutions (kind of a letterbox effect). The display area is still a little larger than 21 inches, but not enormously so. It also costs $4,500, which is, by itself, the cost of Sound Some of the coolest moments in computer gaming are in the game audio. Hearing the sound effects in LucasArts' THEIR FINEST HOUR was incredi ble. Audio is one of the three cornerstone technologies that enable a great gaming experience (along with fast processors and great graphics) Continued on page 112 The Future of Performance own spin on speeding up 3D. Of course, Intel is working on MMX2 (just don't ask the folks at Intel about it). Current MMX instructions are 16-bit in nature, and MMX2 is rumored to be a full 32-bit instruction set. It's interesting to see how all these companies are attaching a great deal of importance to 3D graphics. ystems Performance This is a delicate, shifting balance that never remains constant. Last year, the bottleneck was the graphics system. This year, it's the CPU. Even a 300MHz Pentium II can't saturate a RIVA 128 card. Next year, as game developers begin upping their budget for texture maps, bandwidth over the bus may become the bottleneck. One potential solution is to move some geometry calcula tions, such as lighting transforms, onto the graphics card. However, DirectX 6.0 doesn't look as if it will support hardware acceleration of geometry at this stage. OpenGL certainly is capable of this, but whether consumer-level cards will arrive that can accelerate geometry is, as yet, unknown. CPU Performance CPU performance will soon be open to reexamination as well. Unfortunately, it's looking as if market fragmenta tion may well happen. AMD has announced the K6 3D CPU, which is scheduled to ship around mid-1998. It adds a lot of performance-boosting features and an improved floating point unit. However, the \"3D\" in the name refers to a set of proprietary extensions designed to speed up 3D transforms. Integrated Device Technology (IDT) surprised everyone with its Centaur C6 CPU. The C6 is a poor floating point performer, but IDT IS feverishly working on a C6+ that speeds up floating point and adds its Also on the Intel Front There will likely be a new Pentium Il coming out that will support a 100MHz system clock and run at 350and 400MHz. On the chipset side, Intel's 440BX chipset is supposed to also support a 100MHz bus clock. VIA has added a new chipset that enables Socket 7 boards to have AGP, but whether this will really offer any perfor. mance boost is open to question. Also on the horizon is 4x AGP, which is theoretically capable of moving data to the graphics card from memory at up to 1GB/sec. This begs the question of memory bandwidth. Even SDRAM might have trouble keeping up. By then, though, Intel will begin implementing RAMBUS technology in mainstream systems. RAMBUS is a patented RAM technology licensed by a lot of DRAM vendors that enables very high-speed memory transfers, but won't see system memory duty until sometime in 1999. And when the first IA-64 CPU (code-named Merced) debuts that same year, all bets are off. CGW FEBRUARY 1998 "

"PLUTONIUM POWERED PCS Upgrade Strategies ou may be reading all this and saying, \"I'm just not ready to get a whole new system,\" or \"I could get a whole new sys tem...or I could stay married.\" The good news is that upgrading a component here and there can breathe life into your existing system; and with a well-thought-out upgrade strategy, you can go three to five years-or maybe longer-before buying an entirely new system. The key word here is triage, a technique doctors use to treat wounded soldiers. It's a fairly simple idea: Treat the most critically wounded patient first, and take care of the lighter injuries later. The same strategy can be applied to upgrading your machine. Take a look at our Upgrade Table here, and see where your system components rate. They're listed in order of importance. For killer game performance, upgrading the most ailing compo nent among your CPU, memory, and graphics will deliver the most immediate increase in gaming performance. A couple of notes here: If you're running a 166MHz Pentium or better, you should consider upgrading your 2D/3D graphics first to get more out of your rig, since CPUs of this horsepower or better still have a good bit of life left in them. If you're happy with your current 2D board, and it has 4MB of onboard memory, consider a 3D-only board using the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset, though a PowerVR-based board isn't a bad choice for gamers on a tighter budget. In purchasing a 2D/3D board, 4MB of onboard memory is an absolute minimum, and given that Diamond's Stealth Il costs only about $120, there's no reason to skimp here. Moving to the storage components, if you've outgrown your current hard drive, that's a pretty obvious reason to upgrade to a big. ger one. Disk storage space has never been cheaper: For under $400, you can pack 6.4GB of storage into your box, and for around $200, Seagate has a 3.2GB drive, though it doesn't support UltraDMA/33. We recommend drives that support UltraDMA/33, even if your current motherboard doesn't support it, so that when you do get a new motherboard, you can get some improvement in hard-drive performance as well. A faster CD-ROM drive can certainly speed up game installs and scene loads, but it's less of a critical system component. But in addition to faster performance, many CD-ROM drives ship with a bus mastering driver that cuts down on CPU usage, which can help overall game performance. However, unless you're CD-ROM IS really gasping, upgrade other components first. If you're not into online multiplayer gaming, faster data commu. n ications may not be an issue. A modem upgrade will make Web browsing less painful, and as our recent tests showed, the 56K modems have somewhat lower latency numbers than 28.8 V.34 modems. ISDN is the medium of choice for online gaming, but its associated costs may make it less appealing. Upgrading won't always bring you the across the board speed up that an entirely new system will, but it can certainly add life to aging systems. And after you've bought enough upgrades, you'll basically have wound up with a new system, but on a much more manageable payment plan. Dave Salvator UPGRADE CHART Component If You Have Budget Upgrade Performance Upgrade Pentium II 300 CPU Pentium 120MHz or slower Memory 8-16MB MMX OverDrive 200MHz (budget)* 32MB EDO DRAM (if your system can run SDRAM) Diamond Stealth II 64MB SDRAM 3D Graphics None Installed 2D Graphics Card with 1-2MB local memory Diamond Stealth II 3Dfx-based board (3D-only) or STB Velocity 128 STB Velocity 128 Seagate 4.5GB Cheetah Ultra-Wide SCSI Diamond NetCommander (ISDN) Hard Drive 1GB drive or less Seagate 6.4GB UltraDMA/33 Communications 14.4K or 28.8K modem Global Village (X2 56K) or Diamond SupraExpress (K56Flex 56K) EIDE Goldstar CR-8241B CD-ROM 2-4x drive U/W SCSI Plextor 32x CAV *Note: if your motherboard won't accept an upgrade CPU, go with a new LX-based motherboard with a P-II 233MHz.

"PLUTONIUM ERED Pcs CSOMA que ON the Visit attacco Continued from page 104 Sound Cards The Meltdown needed something a little out of the ordinary. We started with a stock Diamond Monster Sound. Then we ripped out the tiny Wavetable card that's attached. (WARNING: If you do this, it will probably void your warranty.) The little connector on the Monster Sound is, in fact, Wave Blaster-compatible. We then added a Roland SCD-15 Sound Canvas daughtercard, securing it to the Monster Sound with ordinary rubber bands. The MIDI music quality that results is quite a bit better than Monster's stock 2MB wavetable. The cool thing about the Monster Sound, of course, is its use of Aureal Technologies' 3D positional audio, which definitely adds to the experience in a game like JEDI KNIGHT. Using HRTF (head-related transfer functions) to simulate positional audio, Aureal achieves its positional 3D-audio effect through a set of mathematical functions that simulate the delays and positional cues that your ears use to locate sound. Just for the sake of DOS games, we popped a Creative Labs AWE-64 Gold into a free ISA slot. We're hoping that the AWE is the last ISA sound card we have to deal with. Still, it's a good, clean-sounding card and has always been trouble-free. The Heavy Metal has a stock AWE 64 Value Edition. The Value Edition is a nice buy at $95. It's a little noisier than the Gold and doesn't have as much onboard RAM (512KB versus 4MB), but the price is right, it sounds fine, and it's compatible. JURY-RIGGED Two ordinary rubber bands hold this Roland SCD-15 Sound Canvas daughtercard to this Monster Sound part.

It has the speedy you pay for, and it's always better to know Rendition V2100 chip and 4MB of 12ns what you're getting SGRAM, all for $120. The Optiquest Q51 is a decent 15-inch monitor. For a hard drive, the Quantum Fireball ST3.2 can be found for around $220. The same Goldstar CD-ROM unit we used in the Heavy Metal machine works, too, at only $80. Add an AWE-64 Value Edition and a set of Cambridge SoundWorks PC Works, and things begin to cook Of course, you need input devices; Quantum Fireball ST3.2 you can get a decent Keytronic key board for $25.

We couldn't squeeze in a 3Dfx card at this price, but all the other components are actually pretty good. This system would have seemed otherworldly two years ago. Now you can have it for $1,500.

"PLUTONIUM POWERED PCS Speakers Good sound cards deserve great speakers. For the Meltdown, we went with Eminent Technologies' LFT:11. It has two flat-panel linear field transducers and a beefy bass sec. tion. Eminent Technologies supplies an Optimus 15 watts per channel receiver as an option; it's small, so it doesn't take up much space. These speakers stack up well against some very high-end, home audio speakers. The only downside we've found to these babies (other than their $700 price tag) is that they are quite directional; but this is usually not a problem when you're sitting in front of a computer. For the Heavy Metal system, the Cambridge SoundWorks PC Works is the obvious choice. These are the best $ 100 speakers we've ever heard. The quality of their sound is mind-boggling. Input Devices We've tried various mouse alternatives over the years, but the mouse and the keyboard are still our mainstays. Here at CGW, we do a lot of writing, so our choice for keyboard is the Microsoft Natural Keyboard for both systems. A mouse is a mouse is a mouse-until you see the new Logitech mice. For the Meltdown, we use a Logitech Mouseman Plus, which has a unique, contoured shape that's easy on the hand. It has four buttons () and a scrolling wheel. To shave off 10 bucks, we went with the four-button (no wheel) version for the Heavy Metal rig. Rounding out all this is a Gel-eez mouse pad from Case Logic, which has a comfortable, gel-filled wrist rest. PC Works Cambridge SoundWorks Eminent Technologies LFT-11 Logitech Game Controllers Controllers are perhaps the most personal of all game hardware. We tend to gravitate to different controllers, but for the ultimate setup, we prefer the new Saitek X-36 stick/throttle combo, paired with a set of CH Pro Pedals (you can deactivate the rudder gizmo on the X-36 throttle). For more casual gaming, we often plug in a CH Jane's Combat Stick in \"F.16 Combat Stick Mode\" for fast game sessions. After using FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 for testing, we've dusted off our venerable CH Pro Throttle. We haven't yet found a force-feedback device that interests us; they don't feel realistic. Actually, they all seem to be just joy. sticks with motors. For less money, one interesting stick is Microsoft's new SideWinder Precision Pro. It's a relatively low-cost, all-in-one controller, though it won't win any awards for looking or feeling realistic. For driving, our favorite wheel is the ThrustMaster NASCAR Pro Wheel (called the Formula One Pro Wheel in Europe). We like the quick release clamps and instant disconnect for the cable. However, our sim driving is pretty light. If you're a hard-core CART racer, check out the Thomas Super Wheel (TSW). It looks somewhat industrial, but is built like an M1 tank.

"PLUTONIUM POWERED PCS Continued from page 176 joystick, but we didn't have the chance to try one out for this year's rig. We're not big on gamepads, but the ThrustMaster Rage 3D (not to be confused with the ATI Rage graphics accelerator) feels very nice, indeed. You can connect up to four pads for mul. tiplayer action. It's a major improvement over Thrusty's old pad. One other gadget we sometimes use is Saitek's PC Dash. The PC Dash is a nifty little programmable touchpad that can be configured however you wish. Network Hardware Single player gaming still occupies three-quar ters of our game time, but every now and then, friends drop in with their computer for a network game session. We still like the 3Com Etherlink XL 10/100. It's very easy to set up and we've never had any hardware conflicts with the XL. We have a NetGear FE-108, 8-port, 100Mbit hub. There's no problem with lag time in this setup. Setting up a LAN is not necessarily a simple matter, although Windows 95 makes it much easier than DOS does, even for most DOS games. Playing networked WARCRAFT 2, a DOS title, is much easier using Windows 95. While IPX-compatible protocol is still the most common way for connecting games over a LAN, some games behave better using TCP/IP. One unfortunate side effect of the way Windows 95 handles TCP/IP is how it handles TCP/IP addresses. If you don't specify a specific address (a common thing with many ISP connections), the system will periodically pause and search for a source of TCP/IP addresses on the LAN (called a DHCP server). The solution is to hard-code IP addresses for the LAN connection (not your dial-up con nection!). There are actual. ly blocks of IP addresses reserved for private, internal-only networks. Here's the list: 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0192.168.255.255. Pick a set of numbers from these ranges for your own internal network. Our engine of choice for connectivity is ISDN living in California is a blessing for this reason, at least). Cable modems haven't filtered into our area yet. ISDN is a little pricey for the Heavy Metal, but for the Meltdown, the Diamond NetCommander ISDN serves nicely. If you have need of a more stan. dard office setup, a good second choice is the 3Com Impacto external--but it's a little slower than the Diamond. However, it does have two phone jacks and is always on. Sticking with Diamond, we went with the Supra 56e external 56K modem (K56Flex) or Global Village's TelePort X2 modem, which supports USR's X2 standard. With a good ISP, lag times are much reduced, yet not as low as with ISDN. Fusion If you've glanced at the price list, you've seen that the Meltdown comes in at around $11,000. However, our Heavy Metal rig is perhaps more noteworthy. It's no slouch in performance, and has a lot of solid components. We might spend a few bucks more on another 32MB of RAM, but overall, it's a very decent system. It certainly would provide a good springboard for future upgrading, and it's a great system for those of us who aren't quite so obsessive about performance. Looking back on our first ultimate rig article, it's mind-blowing that $2,500 now buys you a 233MHz, 32-bit processor with MMX technolo. gy, a 7,200RPM hard-drive, speedy (and gorgeous-looking) 3D acceleration, and a 17-inch monitor. This was the high end, folks. Technology marches on. The Meltdown is the ultimate dream machine. But it also requires a lot more pampering than does the Heavy Metal. There's a lot of bleedingedge stuff in it, and it requires a little extra TLC to keep it running smoothly. As is the case with a Dodge Viper, it's a bit uncivilized-but it is one fast puppy when speed is what you need. However, if this year's $2,500 system is any indica tion, then what you see here will probably be the mainstream in two years. We hope you find the information helpful, and we're sure you'll get the performance you expect. Until next month, may all your hardware live hap. pily together. Microsok FEBRUARY 1998 "

"HARDWARE Comdex Sightings expressed my concerns to 3Com about potential latency problems. The good news is that the company will check out the issue in its lab. New mass-storage options abounded. Syquest had a couple of interesting items, the first one being their new ICB removalle hardl-cdrive. Dubbed the Sparq, it will retail for $199 (with cartridges for only $33). This looks like a killer piece of gear. Another interesting product is the company's not-yet-shipping 4.7GB removable drive. It will list closer to $600, but a 4.7GB cartridge will cost less than $200. Seagate showed its new Cheetah II. As with the earlier Cheetah (which AMD LI fyou want to see how big the computer industry is, spend a few hours at Comdex This year about 250,000 people made the pilgrimage to Las Vegas for what is now the largest trade show in the world. With 10,000 products on display, it's impossible to see everything, so you have to pick your targets. After surviving the thronging crowds, here's what I have to report I saw several new 32x EIDE CD-ROM drives that looked promising, but I didn't see any Ultra ATA drives. Wandering through the Creative Labs booth, I noticed 3Dfx's software chief intently eyeing users' reaction to Creatives Voodoo 2 demo. And speaking of Voodoo 2, there were demos in a number of places, mostly running TUROK and a couple of racing games. The QUAKE II demo was oddly absent. Creative Labs showed some other interesting stuff, including a DVD-RAM drive (though the standard is still up in the air) and a-gasp! ---PCI sound card. It looks as if 1998 will be the end of the ISA sound card. (And there will be much rejoicing.) Other graphics sightings included Intel's new 2D/3D accelerator, the i740 (code-named Auburn; see 3D Iron Works), a Pentium II laptop (no, it doesn't use Slot l; its the next-generation chip), and several USB mice. Logitech showed a wireless keyboard/mouse combo that will be sold as a bundle. It uses Logitechs radio technology, 50 no line-of-sight is needed to an IR receiver. Several companies, including 3Com and Diamond, showed technol ogy using modems that can be paired together to deliver an aggregate throughput of 112Kbps. Of course, this technology requires two phone lines, but unlike ISDN, much of the technology for supporting these dual-line connections is already in place in ISPs that use Ascend routers). I also got a peek at 3Coms new cable modems. One problem with cable modems is that most cable companies aren't equipped for twoway traffic. 3Coms newly acquired U.S. Robotics division has solved that problem by using standard V34 modems to handle upstream traffic, potentially opening up much more of the country to cable modem technology. This might be great for Web browsing, but I K6 MMX ENHANCED PROCESSOR we selected for our Ultimate Game Machine), it spins at 10,000RPM, but the access time is down to 5.2 milliseconds, and it runs much cooler than the original part. On the processor front, we caught a glimpse of the capabilities of the AMD K6 3D chip. The K6 adds additional instructions that don't exist in Intel processors to help speed up mathematical operations used in 3D graphics. Cleverly, AMD has developed a HAL for Direct3D, so programmers can use the additional instructions in a standard way. For example, we saw 3D WinBench run faster on a prototype K6 3D/300 than on an identically configured Pentium II/300. What's more, we saw a demo of Dreamworks' upcoming TRESPASSER: JURASSIC PARK that looked better on the K6 3D than on the Pentium II. The frame rate was the same on both CPUs, but the Pentium II ran at 320x200 while the Ko ran at 512x384. Oh, and the K6 version had translucent water and filtered textures.

"New High-End Intel Accelerator or more than a year, Intel has been working on a project to bring Lockheed Martin's high-end 3D technology to the PC market. Until now, there's been very little information IRON WORKS about the Intel project, code-named Auburn. At the Comdex computer show, I managed to play with a prototype of the 2D/3D board, called the i740, and I have some numbers to report. Bear in mind that both hardware and software were beta, so these numbers will most likely change. But even for a beta, this part looks promising. I ran 3D WinBench 98 to take a close look at the feature-set supported by the i740. One immediately noticeable result was image quality, which was quite good-especially MIP-mapping. The 1740 did not support the higher-end MIP-mapping features (for example, linear/ mipmap/linear in 3D WinBench 98 parlance) but the more common MIP-mapping modes showed none of the odd streaking or artifacting visible in RIVA 128 cards. The chip also supports antialiasing, though this feature didn't seem to be turned on in a way that 3D WinBench was able to recognize. The i740 delivered impressive performance. The card was AGP-based with 4MB of video memory, running on a 266MHz Pentium II. This beta version of the 1740 came in with a score of 460, placing it between the 3Dfx-equipped Monster3D-which gets around 370-and the RIVA 128 cards, which come in around 490. Given the overall image quality-quite good-this isn't a bad score at all. The real issue is what impact the i740 will have on the overall graphics chip market. If Intel can deliver a chip at a relatively low cost with reasonable 2D and 3D performance, some of the more marginal players may be muscled out of the way. I wasn't able to check out 2D performance or real games. But I'm cautiously impressed, particularly if the price point is right. ---Loyd Case ACRONYM O' THE MONTH DSLAM: Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer A piece of networking hardware used for increasing throughput in DSL connections.

My, how times have changed. raphics cards used to be easy. After running through more than 30 graphics cards in the last few months, I dug into my archives to reread the video card review in the September 1994 Computer Caming World. Back then, the only real game we used for testing was PLICHT SIMULATOR 5.0a. One of our test mainstays was a DOS benchmark called 3Dbench. DirectX wasn't even a twinkle in Microsoft's eye at the time, and Windows 95 was still called «Chicago.\" Almost every game shipping ran under DOS. We tested on two systems, a \"mainstream\" THE ART OF PERFORMANCE In 1994, performance in gaming was defined by how many pixels you could push through the video card. There was only one game (FLIGHT Sim TOOLKIT) that used the 2D acceleration features of certain graphics cards, and no mainstream title used 3D acceleration-though Matrox had a couple of technology demos on their high-end CAD-oriented cards. We ran WinBench 2D WinMarks almost as an afterthought Today, it's much more complicated. You not only have to worry about Windows 2D performance (since many of us, willingly or unwillingly, live and work in the Windows environment), but now you also have to deal with DirectDraw, Direct3D, and OpenGL The graphics cards themselves, though much simpler in appearance, are more complex than ever.

"LOYD CASE a mechanism for talking directly to the hardware. HARDWARE technologies that don't quite behave the way the API expects. The PowerVR chip from NEC and Videologic is a good example. If you've seen CL QUAKE on a PowerVR accelerator, you know it looks pretty good You can quibble about differences in image quality between the 3Dfx PowerVR versions, but GL QUAKE on the PowerVR chip nonetheless looks very nice. But Direct3D and the PowerVR don't always get along very well. Perfonnance can vary radically from one D3D title to the next. These quirky interactions also have an adverse impact on how 3D WinBench \"sees\" the card. With OpenCL, there's a method for adding extensions in a standard way. (That's right, you can add nonstandard features in a standard way; think about that for a moment. It's a powerful idea.) Direct3D doesn't really have this now, though DirectX 6.0 will have CHEATING There's not much difference in real-world performance between a card that gets a 2D WinBench 97 score of 85 and one that gets 100. But the difference sells cards, and card manufacturers look for anything that gives them an edge in marketing. One method is called GDI bypass. CDI (Graphics Display Interface) is the standard way Windows renders regular, 2D, Windows-related, nongame graphics. CDI is what the programmers use when they want to have a window opened, a memu pulled down, or a bitmap painted. Several years ago, graphics card makers discovered they could substitute their own methods for doing these functions and bypass CDI. The result was a dubious increase in real-world performance, but boy, did those benchmark scores suddenly jump. The problem with CDI bypass is the potential for compatibility problems. In stepped Microsoft, using its muscle in a positive way. Now, graphics drivers go through a certification process managed by Microsoft's WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Lab). If a driver turns on CDI bypass by default, it can't get a WHQL certification. So check to see if your graphics hardware has a WHQL certified driver. This doesn't mean that a driver won't have bugs-it just means that its written to conform to Microsoft guidelines. CHECK YOUR DRIVERS Graphics drivers are critical. Check your driver rey numbers, and make sure that you get the latest updates. It can make a big difference in performance and image quality IHRNDERSEA \"A DOUBLE MUST-HAVE.

"PLEXTOR ULTRAPLEX  REVIEW ***** Plextor Delivers HARDWARE with some handy control utilities (including audio extraction) comes with the drive. If you want a CD-ROM drive that's incredibly fast, well-mannered, and easy on your CPU, take a good look at the UltraPlex. ny by Loyd Case hen we reviewed Plextors 12/20 SCSI CD-ROM drive (CGW#158, September 1997), we said it was the last CD-ROM drive you would ever need. That assessment is probably still accurate. However, if you have a slower CD-ROM drive, (which means anything except a 12/20), consider Plextor's newest offering the UltraPlex The UltraPlex is a CAV (constant angular velocity) CD-ROM unit that is rated from 14x on the inner tracks to a full 32x on the outer tracks. This is an Ultra-SCSI device, so it aptly handles the fire hose-sized flood of data this drive can pour into your system. If you have a SCSI host adapter capable of Ultra-SCSI speeds, the UltraPlex can handle burst data transfer rates of up to 20MB/sec. Using WinBench 98s CDROM test, the UltraPlex cranked out a stellar 1670 CD WinMarks, with only 3.8 percent CPU utilization. (Thic host adapter was an Adaptec 2940UW). WinBench 98 also measured an average access time of 95 milliseconds. \"This drive supports just about any CD-ROM format you can imagine, including the new CD-RW discs. It also has a neat feature for audio buffs--the capability of extracting CD Audio (redbook) data across the SCSI bus at full speed. This is far in excess of the old SPDIF connector's Ix speed. The UltraPlex comes in both caddy and tray models; caddies were reintroduced with the UltraPlex due to customer clemand (the caddy protects CDs that are being passed around offices). The UltraPlex can be purchased as an external or internal drive; optional SCSI host adapters are also available, but they'll cost you more. A floppy disk APPEAL: Anyone who wants the ultimate CD-ROM drive. PROS: A CD-ROM drive that behaves almost like a hard drive; cool digital audio extraction; supports all CD formats. CONS: A little pricey; needs SCSI host adapter. RATED ***** GLABS Price: $250 (internal version, no SCSI adapter) Vendor: Plextor (408) 980-1838 www.plextor.com ATI ALL-IN-WONDER PRO  REVIEW ***** A Media Geek's Delight HARDWARE by Loyd Case 've never been very interested in convergence-that warm, fuzzy term that suggests a mating between interactive and passive media technologies. That was until I popped the All-in-Wonder Pro (AIWP) AGP card into my system and became hooked. I admit it: Beyond Babylon 5, I watch almost no television. With the AIWP, though, I find myself running IV in the background, if only to be able to check out CNN occasionally. The TV tuner is pretty amazing, too. It can search for specific channels, put up little thumbnails of numerous channels on your screen, and perform keyword searches on closed-captioning text The video capture features look interesting as well, although AIWP uses software-only compression. Another upside: The All-in-Wonder Pro's NTSC output is very clean, and produces solid image-quality when running througlia television Ultimately, though, I'm a game player, so I needed to be convinced of the Allin-Wonder's 3D and 2D graphics capabilities. I ran the ATI card in an AGP equipped, 266MHz Pentium II (alongside a Diamond Monster 3D). Using 3D WinBench 98's extensive new quality tests, I was able to really wring out the Direct3D performance of the All-inWonder Pro. The Pro supports an impressive set of features; about the only things lacking are antialiasing and perpixel MIP-mapping. The 3D WinBench 98 aggregate frame-rate came in at 346. (This number was for an 8MB card; a 4MB card might not get a score quite this high.) This compares quite favorably to the Monster 3D's 349. Still, there are a few image-quality problems in Direct3D games, such as the severe texture flashing in Microsoft FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98. MOTO RACER and WIPEOUT XL looked pretty good, though. DOS and Windows 2D numbers were good, if not at the top of the heap. Overall, the All-in-Wonder Pro is a terrific card if you want to have IV tuner and video capabilities tightly integrated with your system. It's no slouch as a 3D accelerator, either, although we're eagerly awaiting ATIs new driver releases, which promise even better performance and fixes for some of the image-quality issues. Those caveats asicle, this card is worth a look. D000000 APPEAL: Anyone who wants a solid 2D/3D accelerator coupled with a TV tuner. >PROS: Great TV management; solid 2Dand 3D-performance. CONS: Expensive; needs a cable TV connection for full RATED * *** effect. ELABS E Price: $379 (4MB). $449 (8MB) Vendor: ATI Technologies (905) 882-2600 www.atitech.ca FEBRUARY 1998 CCW "

So if you're hell-bent on having a DVD-ROM unit in your rig, you'd do well to hold on to your existing CD-ROM drive, and run both I also ran a wide variety of DVD movie content on the PC-DVD Encore, and the results were, by and large, impressive. At 800x600x16-bit color, image quality was smooth-both in a window and full-screen-thanks to Encore's bilinear interpolation filtering. This type of filtering smoothies pixelation when the playback image is scaled up, but will sometimes cause a blurry effect if not done well. Blurring was minimal, even on credits. When I upped the resolution to 1024x768 and 1280x1024, image quality headed south somewhat, with some visible deinterlacing that produced jaggies on vertical lines. The Encore's bundled DVD player features a remotecontrol-like interface, and is readily navigated for playing DVD content. The player can also play MPEG-1 and VideoCD content. Creative's second-generation DVD kit gets a lot right, including the price. But DVD-RAM drives --which let you write data as well as read it-should ship by the end of 1998.

"*** * REVIEW  KDS VS-19 MONITOR HARDWARE Livin' Large by Dave Salvator quality for under $1,000. The lack of a specific INF file is an annoyance, and for gamers who also do a lot of fullscreen image editing, the VS-19s curved front glass might curve the corners of images somewhat. Still, in gameplay, this distortion isn't really palpable, and if you're looking for a bigger screen size and don't mind giving up some desk space in the bargain, take a look at the VS-19. hen it comes to displays, big ger is usually better. Of course, with CRT monitors, a bigger picture usually equates to a smaller desk, especially when you move into the behemoth 21inch and 24-inch range. KDS new VS19 monitor which is actually a 20-inch monitor does take up a fair amount of desk real estate, but the bigger picture may be worth the sacrifice. The VS-19 has fairly well detailed on screen display (OSD) controls that let you tweak contrast, brightness, geometry (vertical/horizontal, sizing/position), and color temperature settings. Cetting into the controls is pretty easy, though I didn't find a way to back completely out, and instead waited for the control panel to time-out and disappear. Setup is straightPrice: $949 Vendor: KDS USA forward, since the VS-19 is a Plug-and(714) 379-5599 Play monitor, though the lack of a moniwww.kdsusa.com tor-specific INF file (which lists the monitor's top-end refresh rates) is annoy ing, because it makes tweaking refresh rates more difficult. The good news here is that the VS-19 supports up to 75Hz vertical refresh at 1600x1200. Once setup is complete, the rest of the news is, for the most part, good. When I put the VS-19 through its paces with EAS NBA LIVE 98, its image quality was bright, and colors looked rich and full. And as someone who normally works on a 17-inch monitor, the differe nce in screen size is appreciable. One noticeable curiosity: the VS-19s front glass has a much more pronounced convex curve to it than most monitors, resulting in some image warping\" in the screen's four corners. And while the effect was pretty evident when I ran test patterns, it didn't detract much from image quality during gameplay. All told, the VS-19 is a good monitor offering larger size and good image APPEAL: 15-inch monitor owners looking for a bigger picture. PROS: Big, bright picture; good OSD controls.

"***** REVIEW SC&T PER4MER RACING WHEEL Button Overkill HARDWARE by Loyd Case trols. The base is big, so you need a lot of desk space. Also, the suction cups tend to pop out of the base during gameplay. Maybe a little superglue is in order? The SC&T Per4mer isn't a bad wheel, but it's certainly not a standout. If you can live with the poor button placement and driver headaches, then this could be a lower-cost alternative to the NASCAR Pro Wheel if realism isn't your bag. f the Thrust Master NASCAR Pro Racing Wheel represents an attempt at capturing realisin in a driving controller, then SC&T's Per4mer Racing Wheel is pure fantasy. It's certainly not a believable steering wheel. The first thing you notice are the garish decals that are meant to look like a dashboard. Speed Racer's dashboard may look like this, but I much prefer the spare appearance of the Thrust Master wheel -after all, in most racing games I've driven, the dashboard shows up on the screen. The next thing you notice are the buttons. There are a lot of them, 15 in all. To its credit, SC&T ships a pair of DirectInput drivers that work with the wheel in either 4-button mode (support Price: $99.95 ing most games) or 15-button mode (for Vendor: SC&T International games that allow controls to be reconfig. (602) 368-9490 | ured). Too bad the 15-button mode doeswww.platinumsound.com n't work well. I could never get the hat/pad gizmo to work properly, despite repeated calibration attempts. After getting past the wheel, I moved on to the pedals, which need to be plugged into a special connection on the wheel. I actually liked the pedals quite a bit. For one thing, they're large, with a big platform that allows casy foot placement (there is even a heel rest) and prevents the pedals from sliding around on a carpeted surface. Other makers of driving controls could learn from SC&Ts pedals. Once I got past the installation hurdles, gameplay commenced. I ran through parts of NEED FOR SPEED II and I-76 with the Per4mer. This wheel doesn't feel as light as the CH wheel, but it's not as stiff as the Thrusty, either. It autocenters nicely, but the placement of the buttons generates a lot of confusion when you're actually playing. There are no programming tools; you must count on the game having reconfigurable conAPPEAL: Someone looking for a low-cost wheel with a lot of buttons.

"ODDWORLD: ABE'S ODDYSEE REVIEW ACTION MINE JUMPING Nearly every screen has a set designer's flair for the dramatic. Here, Abe and Elum size up a gauntlet of rotating mines. one plane along the z-axis. Oddworld Inhabitants (the developers) obviously spent a lot of time rendering a realistic looking world. The company intends to reuse it in the ODDWORLD \"Quintology,\" the five-game series of which ODDYSEE is the first part. There are seven distinct environments here, each offering different challenges. You'll have to overcome a variety of objects, such as bombs, motion sensors, meat saws, and falling debris, all the while fending off attacks from bizarre creatures. You'll die frequently, but the game restores Abe automatically to a recent screen. The puzzles are easy at first but become fiendishly clever and more complicated. (See our tips for winning in this month's Gamer's Edge.) The only actual weapon Abe will ever have, apart from a gun-loting Slig, is a band grenade. Most of the time all Abe has to work with is a rock or a piece of meat, and you have to figure out how to use them to defeat your enemies. The puzzles are not only challenging, they're also thoroughly consistent with the game world. Fortunately, Abe isn't entirely alone in his mission. He has the occasional support of allies throughout the game to confer special knowledge or power to him. There are Mudokons, a powerful shaman known as Bigface, and a special creature called Elum. Elum («mule\" spelled backward) is an endearing beast who responds to Abe's voice commands and allows Abe lo ride him, which comes in handy for making big jumps. The only liability Elum poses is that he's prone to distraction when eating honey. This becomes a puzzle in itself as you try to separate him from his favorite food. Fortunately, where there's honey, there are also bees.... AT ODDS I've covered only a few of the game's many terrific qualities. As you can tell, I was charmed and delighted by its personality and wonderful sense of humor. Id love to recommend ABE'S ODDYSEE to anyone, but I can't. You see, the game has a terrible secret.

Where CHASM distinguishes itself is in There are monsters everywhere, its 3D polygonal monsters they are the and it's your job to clean house with the best I've seen in a 3D shooter. They are customary mix of weapons: chain-guns, well-animated, moving as if they actually grenades, mines, and the occasional have mass. More striking, though, is the way they take damage. With careful aim, you can blow off a monster's arm. That may slow him down, but it won't stop him: He'll still punch you with the other hand, Shoot his other arm off and he'll start kicking until you put one in his brain. While the monsters are state of the art, the rest of CHASM feels dated. The levels are wonderfully STRADDLING THE MIDDLE CHASM uses 3D for textured and fairly interactiveyou can shoot out lights and winits cool monsters, but adheres to a dated 2Ddowsbut very 2D. There are no look for its levels. rooms on top of rooms. The sound and mouse controls are a bit flaky, but the framerate is smooth on a P133 or P266. CHASM supports network play in either deathmatch or cooperative mode, but cooperative play prevents you from actually working through the levels together. The level design is solid, though not terribly original just like the entire game. APPEAL: Doom fans whose machines aren't up to QUAKE.

"REVIEW MERIDIAN 59 REVELATION More PK'ing Ahead ADVENTURE/RPG he next MERIDIAN 59 upgrade, titled RENAISSANCE, is expected in the second quarter of '98. It will apply the improved graphical capabilities of Ko'catan to MERIDIAN 59's two major cities, Tos and Raza. The engine that assigns quests to players will also be revised to permit on-the-fly changes. Expect a much greater diversity of quests, as well as penalties associated with timed quests that aren't completed on schedule. RENAISSANCE will primarily focus on expanding the game's player-killing aspect. The discovery of a new region controlled by an evil, magically inclined Queen permits characters to become Necromancers, who gain powerful spells but need to kill other players regularly.

The life and death struggles add an immediacy frequently lacking in traditional adventures. DARK EARTH is the latest entry into this burgeoning genre, and it's a winner -until a truly boneheaded endgame spoils it all to the planet, resulting in global decimation (courtesy of fiery meteorites).

DESIGNER: Radical Entertainment PUBLISHER: Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Irvine, CA. 800-VIECOMi www.vie.com And the gloves are off! It's been a long wait, but EA Sports' all-dominant NHL HOCKEY series finally has some worthy competition in the battle for Lord Stanley's Digital Mug. It comes in the form of Virgin Interactive's NHL POWERPLAY'98, the second installment of the title designed by Radical Entertainment (BRETT HULL HOCKEY 95). Radical has gone the 3D route this time around, adding some glossy oomph to the lovely artificial intelligence of their first effort, last year's NHL POWERPLAY 96. Meanwhile, EA's hot-off-the-press NHL 98 exhibits revamped Al and a marginal reworking of its already superb graphic engine. There's no doubt whatsoever that this pair sits atop the PC hockey world and it's probably no coincidence that both are developed in and around hockey-mad Vancouver, Canada. But that's not to say there aren't other alternatives. Lovers of silly sports may find solace in GT Interactive's NHL OPEN ICE, and that's covered here too. Then there's the also-rans, recent titles you should still find in the minor leagues (er...discount bins)--Time Warner's WAYNE GRETZKY AND THE NHLPA ALL-STARS and Empire Interactive's SOLID ICE come to mind. In any case, Acclaim's NHL BREAKAWAY 98, due by year-end, will have to work out its rookie jitters amongst the company of two very strong players. (Smart Player Ever since Radical Entertainment took what they learned from its innovative but sloppy BRETT HULL HOCKEY 95 and stuck it into the NHL POWERPLAY mold, hockey playin' gamers have been talking about the possibilities of a merger between this level of smarts and something other than its relatively antiquated and sprite-filled 2D uni-camera graphics. Now, Radical has granted their wishes with NHL POWERPLAY 98, a title that's got looks and brains. Again with the blessings of both the National Hockey League and the NHL Player's Association, they've fashioned the closest hockey package ever to what is arguably one of the top sports games of all time, EA Sports' NHL HOCKEY. But, though POWERPLAY remains the best \"substance\" hockey there is, especially in single-player mode where the program's Al is truly tested, little weaknesses keep it from taking the crown. CGW'S PC SPORTS FEBRUARY 1998 "


"Net Gains Visually, Radical programmers have introduced motion-captured players and a 3D environment. They've also offered up no less than five roving cameras, and if you gloss over the small stuff or choose a distant perspective the overall appearance is pretty close to state-of-the-art. But up close you'll see curiously angular players that look even more un-rounded from certain perspectives, become awfully skinny from the side, and turn into static little blockmen when they hit the bench. Ice surfaces and crowds sometimes \"ripple\" as they approach the forefront, pucks may momentarily disappear in the corners, and skaters appear a bit too large for the ice surface. If you're anything like me, you'll finally settle on the relatively distant Overhead cam. Here, you won't get quite the same sensation of 3D, but you will see enough of the ice surface to get a good read on what everybody's doing and lose all of the nitpicky irritants addressed above. The original POWERPLAY featured gameplay options galore, and nothing has been lost in this version, including defensive and offensive positioning, player trades, the ability modify or switch off virtually every major real-life rule, and much more. After each contest, you'll be greeted with a battery of stats and a three-star selection with real player head shots. Season lengths are variable, as are playoff rounds. POWERPLAY's entire menu system is gamepad-driven, which I found quite inconvenient, with an annoying and constant involuntary scroll that had me \"exiting\" instead of \"starting\" and consistently ending up where I didn't want to be. I tried three more controllers and the situation never cleared up. petition. Those of you brought up on a diet of TV OR COMPUTER GAME? POWERPLAY 98 players EA SPORTS hockey will notice right off that usually move and position themselves exactly as they would in the NHL. POWERPLAY takes a far subtler approach. Speed bursts, for instance, may well instill your selected player with some mighty fast skates, but they won't force him to hit warp speed. The same thing applies to just about every facet of the game. Collisions can be rough, often brutal enough to lay an unfortunate player out for a spell, but they won't send human missiles rocketing about the ice. Players hook, hold, and grapple in a constant flurry not unlike the NHL, and even shots and passes that seem a bit retarded at first begin to feel within the range of KABOOM Stevie Y lets a howitzer rip from the slot, as realistic human limitations the more you play. reanu Hund ILLION WHICHIC you play shown from the POWERPLAY 98 replay camera.

At The Buzzer Nevertheless, the factors critical to long-term intrigue are present and accounted for. More simulation than game, NHL POWERPLAY is actually what it claims to be, namely \"the most realistic hockey game ever created\" I found that winning games was a bit too easy, and it is less a complete sensory \"experience than EA's NHL 98, but, then again, EA's been doing the hockey thing twice as long, haven't they? starters, an all too common occurrence in earlier efforts, are much harder to get and much tougher to capitalize upon.

Another hole EA has covered nicely is CPU team line changes. You can forget about taking advantage of those ill-timed and horribly slow changes that left the ice wide open for seconds at a time in NHL 97, simply because they don't do it that way anymore. Nor will Lindros and LeClair opt to hit the bench as they break in on a 2-on0, another ridiculous state of affairs from last year's game.

EA Sports' swaggering NHL HOCKEY series has indeed returned for its annual rite of passage, and as usual it's a thing of wondrous beauty that no PC hockey player should ignore. Even better for serious hockey fans, EA has finally put the emphasis on upgraded artificial intelligence rather than the absolute latest in graphical wizardry. It's no secret that Al has long been the Achilles heel of what otherwise has been one of the most amazing and complete PC sports experiences there is. Now, with Virgin Interactive's smart NHL POWERPLAY 98 descending on the marketplace, EA has made some moves in what would appear to be the right direction. Ain't competition grand? I remember not so fondly the frustrating oddities of NHL HOCKEY in the past (to this day my garbage can harbors a grudge from one particularly savage beating), and am happy to report that several have been corrected. Breakaways, for The Fix Is In Yet all is not perfect.

This includes skaters who sport a seemingly infinite variety of maneuvers, not just between whistles but during play stoppages too, when they'll tap their sticks on the ice, test their shooting motions and mill about as real players do. Both audio and video can be a bit over the top at times, but EA can be forgiven for leaving realism behind when the results are this exciting. Multiple cameras are again part of the package, as is the best replay component to grace any sports game. New for '98 are PIP displays of the penalty box as players get set to exit, disallowed goals attributed to crease violations, and a Coaching Strategies utility. Remember though, NHL 98 is first and foremost a test of reflexes and timing. Good coaching will take you only so far. In a perfect world, the folks at EA Sports would join forces with the crowd from Radical, take the best from NHL 98 and NHL Powerplay '98, and concoct the perfect game. It really wouldn't take much because the pieces are already there. In the meantime however, and even though I've bestowed identical ratings to both, NHL 98 gets a marginal nod because nothing immerses you in the overall PC hockey show, and nothing is as flatout invigorating as this veteran performer. HOCKEY GONE AMOK The sheer force of Joe Nieuwendyk's stick causes the puck to burst into flame, while Claude Lemieux gets 2 minutes for that enormous kisser. (Insanity On Ice See funny man with big head. Ha ha. See other man. He do flip way up in air. This fun. Make me pee pants. It warm. Mmm... Alright, so GT Interactive's NHL OPEN ICE isn't my cup of tea. But arcade-reared sports-loving kids are probably gonna eat this thing up because 1) it's got their hockey heroes performing outlandish maneuvers and, 2) it's an exacting replica of the coin-op beast. The rest of you? Well, you might find it a hoot too, for a few moments anyway. But enough of the snide remarks. NHL OPEN ICE, curiously licensed by the same two professional hockey organizations who lent their name to the genre's more serious titles, isn't a simulation and wasn't meant to be. As a matter of fact, it's about as far removed from the National Hockey league as pro wrestling is from the Olympic variety. From the stereotypically cheesy coin-op front end, players are taken through game setup screens where minimalist game options such as period length, \"super\" or \"normal\" goalies and difficulty levels are established. With cheerleaders urging them on, they'll also have a few seconds to enter in a power-up code or two. Then it's game time. On the ice, its mayhem all the way as your two skaters and goalie battle with computerized or human opposition. And if you've happened across certain codes beforehand or hit the right button combinations while playing, there's no telling what mutations or bizarro activities you might see.

Betcha he can't do a triple spin-o-rama 30 feet above ice level or launch a blast of such magnitude that both puck and net end up in flames. The fact that he can here doesn't seem so incredulous once you've been playing awhile, and neither do momentary yet stupefying boosts in speed, checking, shooting and puck-handling. Just make sure your \"turbo meter\" is cranked--you know, like Scotty Bowman did before he sent Shanahan onto the ice in last year's Cup final. With four human players, each of you can take on a single on-ice persona and the game will admittedly get a tad exciting.

"FOOT Despite pixelated, less than state-of-the-art graphics, the player motion in NCAA is perhaps the most fluid and realistic yet seen in a computer football game. A ball carrier slammed to the turf by a hard tackle, for example, will bounce or slide a few feet further, rather than dropping like a rock as in most sims. College football fanatics will enjoy NCAA's season play, which simulates the weekly rankings. It's a blast to command your favorite team and guide it in a quest for the national championship. NCAA provides officially licensed rights to 112 Division l-A schools and four major post-season bowl games. On the down side, there's only one view, an elevated, behind-the-quarterback look that makes throwing to outside receivers an exercise in faith, since they can't be seen unless your QB rolls out to that side. More disappointing is the lack of a planned career mode which would feature recruitment and graduation. Maybe next year.

"BALL ST SUPER BOWL CGW'S SPORTS COLUMNIST LOOKS BACK AT HIS '97 FOOTBALL PREDICTIONS by Dennis McCauley FOOTBALL PRO Acclaim NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB 98 Predicted Finish 6 Actual Finish that decision? The answers are, in order: never; Christmas shopping season; cut back on features; and marketing weenies. So we're left with an underMADDEN cooked MADDEN that's a good 898 game, but not what it could have been. Still primarily an action-oriented title, MADDEN nevertheless is creeping into sim territory with roster management features that include a rudimentary trading module. Unfortunately, the game's stats, once you locate them, still lag behind the presentation found in the hardcore sims. Gameplay-wise, certain gadget plays, such as the Hail Mary, succeed far too often to maintain any sense of true simulation. And numerous bugs serious hamper the action. The bottom line on MADDEN 98 is that it's a hot property that was unfortunately pushed out the door before it was fully baked. EA Sports obviously knows this and is completing patches that address some of the key issues (at press time, a 3Dfx patch was nearing release). It's an enjoyable game, but it has a lot of warts. CBS Radio broadcaster Howard David. In the pointless eye candy department you'll find 3D renderings of all 30 NFL stadiums displayed briefly at the beginning of the game. But the ingame views are just generic grey backdrops. The game interface has changed as well, making navigation marginally more intuitive than in past editions. Commissioners of the plentiful FPS online leagues will appreciate the ability to generate HTML output of league files. If you don't own a previous edition in the series, by all means, grab this one. FPS '98 is a steal at its $29.99 list price (Sierra's tacit admission that the game is just an upgrade), and it still includes all the great features that have made FRONT PAGE the decade's dominant gridiron simulation. One of last year's sleepers was Acclaim's NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB 97 and arcade sports gamers were hotly anticipating the sequel. Unfortunately the targeted release date in October came and went, and a contact at Acclaim recently informed CGW that the PC edition would not be released this year because it did not measure up to the Nintendo 64 version. Accolade LEGENDS FOOTBALL 98 Predicted Finish 2 Actual Finish Sierra FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO 98 Predicted Finish 7 Actual Finish 4 As predicted, Sierra's FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO 98 is essentially last year's game with a few cosmetic changes layered on. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since the '97 version was a prime-time player that copped a 4.5 star review in CGW. In fact, the entire FPS FOOTBALL series has been evolving incrementally over the last four years. This year, unfortunately, there's little substantive reason to recommend the game over its ancestors, especially since Sierra and developer Synergistics are known to be gearing up for a ground-up rebuilding of FRONT PAGE for '99. So, what's new this time around? Keeping up with the Joneses (and the MADDENS), Sierra has added lackluster play-by-play commentary from ABC Interactive HEROES OF THE GRIDIRON Predicted Finish 5 Actual Finish 5 Since HEROES OF THE GRIDIRON is basically MNF '98 with college teams, it may surprise some that it ranks this low. However, while HEROES is a good stand-alone game, one can't help but have the feeling that it should have been just an MNF '98 module. HEROES employs only 32 of LO SPORTS the better-known college teams, and uses nostalgic rosters of past players. Unfortunately, a disproportionate number of the players seem to be from the 1970's and later, apparently due to licensing difficulties with players who were not NFLPA members. The small number of teams and fairly recent run of players sadly detract from the game's sought-after nostalgic feel. Fortunately, all of MNF's good points apply to Heroes, with the exception of the ABC TV atmosphere, which is super low-key in the college version. Can someone check Keith Jackson for a pulse? And then there's LEGENDS 98, probably the only sports game in history to lose to a vaporware title. Yes, LEGENDS is so bad you're better off with no game. And to add insult to injury, LEGENDS had the coolest concept of any sports game this year. As an NFL junkie, I was completely ga-ga over the chance to pit cross-era pro teams gainst one another. I imagined Emmitt Smith crashing helmets with Dick Butkus, LEGENDS38 and Sammy Baugh trying to throw the deep post against Deion Sanders. Instead, what Accolade unleashed was a buggy game with meaningless player ratings, bad A..., and rampant scoring. Accolade needs to seriously question the design decisions that went into this game. The list is long and undistinguished, but here's just a few of the more vexing issues: How can you release a Win95 product with no mouse support? How is it that it was the season's only game without jersey numbers? How do you release a graphics-oriented sim into today's market with no 3D support?

Slower court play is made even duller by the play-by-play announcing by Chick Hearnhe sounds like those announcers of old, calling a game circa 1950 or '60.

You can only assign three plays to your gamepad (or keyboard); the other two are unchangeable. APPEAL: PC basketball fans looking for more control, accuracy than NBA Live. Balancing Act The offense in NBA LIVE 98 still has an unmistakable advantage over the defense, as it always has, and the unusually high scores reflect that. The reason for this is two-fold. On the one hand, it's still really difficult to block a shot or even cause an opponent to miss, or to steal the ball. Many computer teams shoot the lights out at the higher difficulty levels, while your team goes cold at the other end. Which leads to the next problem: the disparity among the difficulty settings. The rookie level is too easy offensively, as you can sink just about everything you throw up, most of which are dunks, while any difficulty level higher than that means the same for your opponent, while your seven-foot center sometimes misses easy put-backs. There needs to be a setting where both teams play at even keel. One way to balance the scales a little is to bump up the frequency of defensive fouls a bit, but you'll also have to play defense more cautiously to avoid the wrath of the whistle-happy referees. Play Calling PROS: Excellent player controls, relatively low system requirements, deep coaching Off the court, NBA options, good graphics. ACTION contains an interesting array of CONS: Game speed problems, dull play-by. play, limited multiplayer support. coaching strategies and features. A number of slide bars are used to adjust tempo and crash boards on offense. You can assign plays to three buttons, with two more--alley oop and double team--that can't be changed. On defense, you can also pick one opposing player to double team. All of these settings can be combined into one of three sets that can be called from the court, giving you a lot of combinations to try. Like NBA LIVE, there is a faceup button on defense (called a step modifier), which doesn't work as well since the defender doesn't stay facing his man. That means you have to let up on the step modifier a lot to correct the direction he's facing. There's also no illegal defense call whatsoever. But playing defense in NBA ACTION is better in many ways than in NBA LIVE. You really have to work to get an open shot or you'll get rejected. Although it might be a bit too easy to block a shot in NBA ACTION, at least you can do it with dependable regularity. And you'll have to be extra careful about getting your own shots blocked—the shooting animation doesn't end when the ball is released. It will take your man a second or two to recover from taking a shot before he can go after his own loose ball after the block. Finally, NBA ACTION has the distinct advantage of being far easier on system requirements than NBA LIVE, making it a better choice for those who haven't upgraded their rig to the latest and greatest Pentium with 3D acceleration-a must for getting the full enjoyment out of EA's title. At The Buzzer Although it perpetuates the series' lingering problem of court awareness by computer-controlled players—who step out of bounds needlessly, shoot from behind the backboard, or get called for three-seconds in the key-NBA LIVE 98 continues to improve on an already solid game. With more coaching and strategy options (you can assign a play to all of the buttons on the gamepad and call them from on the court), it's now a deeper game--but it could still get a few pointers from NBA ACTION 98.  Final Score NBA ACTION 98 is a solid and promising contender that should enjoy a good rookie season, but it's going to have to do a little tweaking and adjusting to its game to play at the same level as NBA LIVE. Watch for this player next year, but for now, the veteran is still the one to beat. 196 CGWPC SPORTS FEBRUARY 1998 "

"SABRE ACE: CONFLICT OVER KOREA  REVIEW SIMULATION/SPACE FORMATION TAKEOFF There's more emphasis on formation flying in this game than in your typical sim. the design resulted from a pitched battle between realism nuts and action-game fans. The planes have a pleasantly fluid feel, with suitably mushy low-speed handling, and do bleed airspeed in turns, but the program artificially limits control inputs to prevent stalls. All aircraft are overpowered in climbs and can maintain ridiculously steep pitch angles indefinitely. Prop fighters demonstrate no torque effects, though lift is appropriately enhanced at higher throttle settings. Tum performance is fairly accurate for them, but becomes unrealistically good once you get to fly the F-86 or MiG-15. This problem is exacerbated by the absence of blackout/redout modeling Casual gamers will not mind these deviations from reality, of course, and even serious simmers might find the furballs satisfactory if they refrain from exploiting loopholes in the flight model. What casual gamers may have a problem with is the sims difficulty, which cannot be adjusted. The Al pilots vary widely in skill. While the dumber ones are easy marks, the aces can give even experienced sim vets headaches. Kills are especially hard to come by in the later prop-fighter missions, when most of your opponents are flying vastly superior jets. Fortunately, evasion and escape is usually an option. Also, you need not succeed at a mission to proceed to the next view system. Only 10 fixed-view directions are provided, plus a GCI tracking mode that automatically snaps between the 10 in an attempt to keep a selected larget in sight. \"Attempt\" is the operative word here there are large gaps between views that should rightfully overlap. An cnormous blind spot also exists upward to the sides and rear. Combining the GCI view with peeks at the target information displayed on the dash is workable once you have learned some of the Als behavior patterns; until then, prepare to be frustrated. Blind spots also make finding targets annoyingly difficult. Except for some stunning aircraft renderings, the visuals are pretty, not jaw-dropping. Ground detail is coarse except near cities, yielding a poor sense of your height above ground. However, visibility limits are high, and SABRE ACE boasts impressively fast frame rates with full terrain texturing — if you have a 3D video accelerator card, that is. Nonaccelerated graphics are too choppy to be playable on an average Pentium unless you turn the detail all the way down. Even the accelerated graphics can bog down when the view fills with too many aircraft or flak bursts. Be warned that a few buyers have encountered installation problems on systems equipped with 3D cards. SABRE ACE shows much promise, but is ultimately flawed. Even if you can accept the flight-model simplifications, the game's otherwise immersive gameplay is still marred by its deficient, playability-sapping cockpit view system. This may be the best Korean War sim released in many years, but right now, that's not saying much. NO JOY Part of what makes dogfights in SABRE ACE so tough is the sims awful cockpit Back to Schoo Ithough SABRE ACE's combat training missions are nothing special, the extensive takeoff, landing, and routine navigation tutorials are exceptionally well done. You get to fly real trainer aircraft: the T-6 and Yak-18, respectively, for USAF and USSR primary training. The T-33 or MiG-15UTI follow only after you have mastered the prop trainer and are deemed ready to strap on a jet. The virtual flight instructor who talks you through the lessons watches you like a hawk, monitoring and critiquing everything: your speed, altitude, heading, even the direction you are looking (he gets really annoyed when you turn around to look at him in the back seat). If the instructor thinks the plane is about to crash, he will scold you as he takes back the controls. Fighting for control of the plane at that point will only get you more verbal grief. This interactivity makes the training immersive and fun-even humorous at times as well as effective. Though you don't have to work through it, training is a high point of the game. APPEAL: Anyone who has been anxiously waiting for someone to release a Korean War sim; experienced sim fans willing to overlook flight-model inaccuracies; novices seeking an accessible, yet challenging, first sim. >PROS: Outstanding flight-training segment; high 3D-accelerated frame rates; beautiful aircraft graphics; good atmosphere; Korean War setting. >CONS: Limited number of canned missions and no mission builder; terrible view system; simplified flight model; poor performance without a 3D card; no multiplayer chat; may be too difficult for novices.

"ARMORED FIST 2. REVIEW TURKEY IN YOUR TANK The game severely lacks in the AI department. Some units are totally passive as you pick them off one by one, while others act as if they're intent on ramming your tank. Mission complexity and difficulty is achieved by adding more and more enemy units to destroy while forcing you to control more and more brainless friendly units. I also experienced problems with game crashe s and an apparent bug that causes units to become confused by their waypoint orders. Anyone hoping that ARMORED FIST 2 might be a worthy successor to MI TANK PLATOON, the MicroProse classic released back in 1989, will be disappointed. The good news for armor fans is that t ank simulations, which have been neglected by game publishers for years, are suddenly in style. At least there's hope that a new lank-sim champion will emerge in the near future.

One of the most annoying aspects of Although I eventually became profithe original ARMORED FIST was the cient at manual gunnery, I found that as autolock targeting system that often played more complex scenarios in which made it difficult for you to shoot at the my tank had to rapidly engage multiple greatest threat, because target selection targets, I needed to turn the autolock feacontrol was taken out of your hands. ture back on.

And driver's position with the autolock option this time, NovaLogic didn't make the enabled is the best way to win the more mistake of leaving out a more realistic difficult missions. But most armor-sim gunnery model for those who want to do fans would prefer to spend their time their own shooting shooting the 120mm gun than driving, APPEAL: Gamers who are looking for an unrealistic, but easy-to-play tank simulation. >PROS: Rolling terrain; great sound effects; multiplayer capability. CONS: Clueless Al; utter lack of realism; crash problems; limited replay value. A View of Two Abrams: Armored Fist 2 vs. iM1A2 Abrams ovaLogic's ARMORED FIST 2 joins Interactive Magic's IM1A2 ABRAMS as the second tank sim on the market featuring the US Army's M1A2 battle tank. How do the two games stack up against each other? For pure glitz through the use of graphics, music, sound effects, and full-motion video, ARMORED FIST 2 is the handsdown winner. But for those who want a more realistic experience without the requirement of a speedy, RAM-crammed MMX Pentium, IM1A2 is the clear choice. The gunnery model of iM1A2 is far more accurate than that in ARMORED Fist 2. Real1M1A2 ABRAMS: Graphically flat, but realistic. world tactics actually work. And although IM1A2's Al isn't the greatest, it makes the Al in ARMORED FIST 2 look pathetic. IM1A2 includes ARMORED FIST 2: Glitzy, but empty. dynamic campaigns, infantry, and greater unit variety, and it handles air and artillery support far better. ARMORED FIST 2's strength lies in its ease of play and terrain modeling. Surprisingly, I liked ARMORED FIST 2's commander's station better than IM1A2's, because it was easier to spot and designate targets for my gunner. ARMORED FIST 2 is for gamers who want to jump into an Abrams and drive around the battlefield admiring the pyrotechnics they create. FEBRUARY 1998 CGW "

"***** REVIEW MYTH: THE FALLEN LORDS LBloody Good Time DIFFICULTY LEVEL STRATEGY / WARGAMES This Is Not Your Kid's Real-time Strategy Game by Greg Fortune ungie's latest game, MYTH: THE FALLEN LORDS, is not for the weak of spirit...or stomach. It is, however, a victory for all of us who love the combat aspects of games like ACE OF EMPIRES and WARCRAFT, but could do without the endless gathering and building. Featuring a physics-based 3D engine and spectacular graphic violence, MYTH strips the standard real-time strategy game to the bone. What it leaves behind is brutal and bloody combat that is engaging, adklictive, and brimming with more attitude than a surly dwarf. SNOW BLIND Weather effects, including snow, can affect your troops' performances. valuable. An archer with 10 kills will fire faster and more accurately than an archer who has never seen action. As you progress through the missions, veterans that have survived previous battles will occupy the positions that would otherwise be filled by raw recruits. THE TALLEN 12 TELL ME A STORY The premise of MYTH is pretty standard. An army of the undead is ravaging your homeland, and you must drive them out or be destroyed. Ordinarily, a premise this tired would choke the originality out of a product, but Myths story stands out because it is detailed, original, and wellintegrated into the game. The prologue, cut-scenes, and unfolding plot combine to involve you in the conflict at a deeper level than a shallow back-story ever could. You get an actual sense of unease as you face the dark times ahead. In creating the characters for MYTH, Bungic wisely decided to mix a few familiar fantasy staples with some new creations of its own. You will immediately recognize the dwarves, foot soldiers, and archers. The unfamiliar elements come in the form of the walking dead: gruntlike thralls, spirit spearmen known (appropriately) as soulless, exploding gas-filled corpses called wights, and others. Each unit, friend or foe, has a unique name and a unique history. As the men under your command gain experience, they become more effective and more TALK ABOUT A CONTROL FETISH!

"MYTH: THE FALLEN LORDS REVIEW STRATEGY / WARGAMES GET IN LINE! Myth is a difficult game that demands excellent strategy and unit control. Placing troops in 1 of 10 formations is a key to victory. based on their number and composition. You also need to factor in the environment and the makeup of focal points. One rotation pivots around the center of your field of view, allowing you to circle whatever you are looking at. The other allows you to rotate in place, which gives you a view of the surrounding area. At first, moving around and directing troops using this view system is a bit difficult. With practice, however, you will quickly learn to appreciate the view system's flexibility. My only complaint about the controls is that you should be able to adjust the views angle of elevation, as fighting on high ground frequently left me unable to see enough of the battlefield to fight effectively. Otherwise, I found that the controls worked well and were well thought-out. DANCE OF THE DEAD Most games offer you a few easy beginning scenarios before getting to the meat of the game. MyiH does not. Make no mistake; this game is difficult. The most surprising thing about the gameplay is the degree of strategy required to win any given scenario. You begin each mission with a set number of units, and unless you find additional troops wandering around the level (or fighting for their lives), that's all you have to work with. MYTH allows you to arrange your units in a variety of formations. Surprisingly, these formations actually work. From vanguards to staggered lines, how you arrange your forces affects your strategy and your chances for survival. If you want to have any veterans left for the next scenario, you will need to figure out an effective way of deploying your troops Leave a flank exposed and you'll soon find a MAKING A MESS A couple of dwarves can really ruin an enemy's couple of apo day.

"***** REVIEW  CLOSE COMBAT 2: A BRIDGE TOO FAR DIFFICULTY LEVEL Off to Market STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Real-time Wargaming Comes of Age by Patrick C. Miller GARDEN OF DEATH LOSE COMBAT: A BRIDGE Too FAR isn't a game to be played so much as experienced. You experience disappointment when an attack bogs down for lack of armor support, frustration when troops under fire refuse to obey orders, and remorse when heroes of earlier battles are mercilessly cut down by enemy machine-gun fire. Yet you also have feelings of elation when victory is achieved against insurmountable odds, satisfaction as tactics start to click, and accomplishment after completing a difficult campaign peration Market Garden began on September 17, 1944, when thousands of American, British, and Polish paratruopers were dropped into Holland to seize a series of bridges along a 60mile corridor. The British 30th Corps attacked northward to link up with the paratroopers. If the operation had gone as planned, it would have enabled the Allies to cross the Rhine River at Arnhem and attack Germany itself, possibly ending the war in Europe before Christmas. Unfortunately, the Allies ignored intelligence reports indicating the presence of two German SS armored divisions in and around their drop zones. Given the questionable decision to have 30th Corps attack up a single, easily defended road-and the fact that the Germans captured the complete Allied battle plan—it's a wonder the operation came as close to success as it did. In the end, Market Garden cost the Allies 17,000 casualties without achieving the objective of capturing a bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem. Of course, one of the main reasons we play wargames is to change history.... Good luck. If you think you can do better than the historical commanders, here's your chance. Microsoft RIPCORD AWAY! Based on Operation Market Garden during World War II, this game delivers the pressure, tension, and drama of tactical warfare at close range. Plus, it's all done on extraordinarily detailed maps. in 16-bit color. Real-time gameplay combines with an emphasis on troop morale, physical and mental states, and battle experience to propel A BRIDGE Too FAR into the realm of realistic c ombat simulation.

There are only seven commands: move, move fast, sneak, fire, fire stoke, hidle, and defend. Giving unit orders is fairly simple; you use either a mouse-activated menu or keyboard commands. Some players have a hard time getting used to the combat stress psychological model that can cause units to act on their own initiative. Occasionally, this results in heroic behavior, but more often, self-preservation instincts prevail. Players must also develop effective tactics and small-unit strategies to have any hope for success when playing at the higher degrees of realisin. Not all changes made were for the better, nor is the game without some minor flaws. Because soldiers are larger, buildings no longer have the interior walls that sometimes made for interesting indoor firefights. The game replay feature is gone, as Valkenswaard) LOGISTIC LOGIC In the campaign game, you must decide which sectors of the operation are the most crucial and should receive the greatest amount of supplies. Info: Style: ALL OFFROA GIOCO The Twilirds When Microsoft released CLOSE COMBAT more than a year ago, there was nothing quite like it on the market. The designers at Atomic Cames have now raised that standard even further by smoothing CLOSE COMBAT'S rough edges. This time, the company has included features that not only add variety and improve gameplay, but also provide a significant amount of long-term replay value -one of the original game's greatest shortcomings. From a gameplay perspective, A BRIDGE TOO FAR isn't all that different from CLOSE COMBAT. The emphasis remains on tactical engagements between infantry sections and individual vehicles. However, many of the changes implemented in the sequel have made what was a good game outstanding. The interface is more responsive and intuitive. Map scrolling is smoother. There are more units and more missions (and greater mission variety). You can edit missions with the Battlemaker feature to design new scenarios (although there is no way to create additional maps). The games stronger strategic element provides more depth to the dynamic campaign, and modem-to-modem play has been added. Also, network play is more stable than before. The game comes with 33 battles, which can be played separately or as part of Il multibattle operations. There are three campaigns, based on battles in the Eindhoven, Nijmegen, and Amhem sectors.

Although some buildings in the game are designed to allow vehicles to enter them, there are bugs in the game that sometimes enable a tank or antitank gun to get the benefit of being on top of a multilevel building. Tanks sometimes have problems deciding which way to face. As a result, a tanks hull sometimes appears to be doing the rumba with its turret. Fans of turn-based wargames might be inclined to write off A BRIDGE TOO FAR as a simplistic real-time clickfest or yet another effort that sacrifices gameplay for eye candy. But they would be very wrong in that assessment, for A BRIDGE TOO Far is an engrossing affair; one in which you can easily become immersed for hours. No other game can touch it for conveying the sights, sounds, and feel of combat at the buttend of a rifle. FEBRUARY 1998 CGW "

"**** REVIEW  NETSTORM DIFFICULTY LEVEL Winds of Change Stormy Combat Game Brings New Energy to Real-Time Strategy STRATEGYZ WARGAMES by Tahsin Shamma discussion of the recent weather forecast may be fine for small talk, but find a room filled with rcal-time gamers and any talk of a NEISTORM is likely to bring more than just plain chitchat. NET STORM is a game like no other. It invig. orates a genre that some feel is becoming too repetitive. Yet its originality risks alienating real-time gamers who are just setting into the traditional WARCRAFT 2 game design. A word of advice: NETSTORM can intrigue and enthrall you, if you're willing to accept the fact that real-time strategy games are not all the same. The only game that I can recall with a similar feel was Atari's RAMPART (an arcade game of castle-building and cannon-firing) HOLY DEFENSES, BATMAN! This altar is well defended by Wind Towers and Crossbows. The goal of each mission is to sacrifice enemy Priests here. NETSTORM STORM OVER NIMBUS NETSTORM takes place in the mythical world of Nimbus. The world is divided into three \"spheres» of interaction: the Serenisphere, a heaven in which players match up for Net battles: the Pyrosphere, the island-laden arena in which players engage in combat; and the Deusphere, the lowest realm, from which the Furies hurl up Storm Geysers to fuel the battles above. Of these spheres, players will enter only the first two; the third, where the Furies of Wind, Rain, and Thunder battle, is an imaginary realm whose sole purpose is to provide atmosphere and backstory. Players begin on floating islands in the Pyrosphere and must construct bridges to launch assaults against others. This may seem like an unnecessary addition to the gameplay, but it enhances strategic thinking, as no two bridges may overlap. \"Thus, it is possible to cripple an enemy just by cutting off his avenues of construction. If enemy bridges surround a player, he can't extend his own bridges to attack other players. Power through the single High Pricst, an avatarlike unit in gameplay. The High Priest is the only unit capable of constructing buildings including the all-important temple, which allows players to harness Storm Power and radiates the necessary power for building units. The fact that only priests can construct buildings might seem as if it would hinder construction, but there are really only two buildings that need to be built to start any game. Once players build a temple, the workshop fulfills the role of the traditional «barracks» site. The workshop offers various unit types, including \"generator\" units that allow you to extend the range of your temples Storm Power. RESOURCES AND CONSTRUCTION Players have the ability to harvest the energy brought up in Storm Geysers as Storm Crystals. The crystals provide Storm Power that is used to construct weapons, buildings, and units, as well as to cast spells.

Designer: Titanic Entertainment Publisher: Activision Los Angeles, CA (800) 477-3650 www.activision.com n NESTORM's new units may seem odd and difficult to handle at first, but a quick glance at a unit's design demonstrates its usefulness. Crossbow: Due to its wide field of fire and rapid reloading, the crossbow is great as an assault weapon or a defensive post to fend off aerial attackers. Aerial Attack Units: These units are the \"bombers\" of NETSTORM. Their extremely long range and medium attack strength help soften up defenses. Cannons: The Ice cannons and Thunder cannons have great power but fixed facing. This makes the weaker, but more versatile, Sun cannon more useful. CGW FEBRUARY 1998 "


"berek VIRTUAL REP Y JOYSTICKS STRATEGYZ WARGAMES PCWEEK BEST OF D.COMDEX NOV-97 COMBAT IN THE CLOUDS In NETSTORM, placement is the supreme factor when deciding what to build and how to attack an opponent. In other games, a mobile unit is built and ordered around. But in this game, every combat unit is autonomous, with the exception of transports. If you place a weapon on the ground, it attacks a target in its Own way, without waiting for instruction. So in effect. the placement of units determines low successful they are. The ultimate goal is to capture the opponient's priest and sacrifice him on an altar. Once you kill him, you will gain the dead priests knowledge and Storm Power. In this way, you increase your own Pricst's skills. For those who are willing to brave the unique gameplay and keep their minds open to a new version of real-time gaming, NETSTORM is quite a find. But this creative brainstorm still lacks some simple elements. The biggest drawback is the absence of a savegame feature for the single-player campaign. The campaign proceeds in three parts, in addition to a tutorial that instructs players in placing units and gathering Storm Power. The early missions in the cam GET PAST THIS! This shot shows your buildings paign are fast and the bridge pieces you use to connect to enough that you Storm Geysers. don't notice the lack of a save feature, but the later missions, some of which last two hours, practically demand it. Combine this oversight with a lack of difficulty settings, and campaigns become a do-or-die feat. There are a few other unrealistic elements in the gameplay as well. If a section of an extended bridge between land and an attached unit is destroyed, the rest of the bridge hangs in midair, along with any units attached to it. The selection of bridge tiles is also too random for my tastes. In strategy games, you want as few variables as possible when fending off opponents. The randomized selection of bridge pieces sometimes makes you feel as if you are playing TETRIS. APPEAL: Real-time strategy All in all, NETSTORM is a gamers looking for an original game good game and deserves high design. marks for demonstrating that PROS: Innovative combat style that all real-time games don't have to be alike.

It will be a long and difficult trail before he is able to do that. For any ANDS OF LORE: GUARDIANS OF DESTINY is Westwood's longdelayed sequel to its popular adventure-RPG of 1994. It's the story of Luther, son of Scotia, whom we dispatched in the first LORE. Luther has several problems. For one, he's cursed by random transformations into other forms. Without warning, he may become either a beast or a lizard, The beast form is slow, ponderous, and nonmagical. It is, however, a ferocious fighter of great power. The lizard form is small, weak, and not a fighting critter. On the other hand, it is extremely fast and can cast magic spells. The problem is that Luther has no control over these forms, and he can morph into them at any time. His other problem is that the Gladstone guards are after him to put him back in prison. As the game begins, Luther has just made his escape and is on the run to SOLO MIO GUARDIANS OF DESTINY is a singleperson, real-time, 3D game. There is no party of characters, nor does anyone join Luther, even temporarily. It's strictly a solo adventure. In the lower-right comer is a portrait of Luther, plus icons for your weapon and current spell, along with a blue bar for mana and a red one for health. Clicking on the portrait brings up the inventory box, which displays everything you're carrying, as well as which weapons, armor, and miscellaneous items you have. At the top right of the inventory screen are four bars that measure your fighting strength and armor protection. As your abilities improve over time, these bars become longer. Various equipped items can affect these stats, RPG-starved gamer, this one is a disappointment beyond words. making them better or worse. Clicking on the bars switches them with the level gain bars, one for magic and one for combat. All these stats are visual only as in the first LANDS OF LORE, no actual numbers are used for strength, mana, or hit points. Combat is a simple procedure. Luther faces his foe, and you click either the weapon icon (to swing or shoot missiles) or the magic icon (to cast a spell). The spells come in sets of four; when Luther learns a spell, he gets the whole set at once. \"To cast a spell beyond the first, you can hit 2-4 on the number keys, or target the opponent with the mouse and hold the right mouse button until the desired spell is reached. Conversation in the game is extremely limited. Typically, as Luther approaches someone with something to say, talking begins automatically. There are no choices to make; everything said by both parties is entirely prerecorded. GUARDIANS has an excellent automap. As usual, it fills in as you go along, and you can bring it up for viewing at any time with the Tab key. Some important locations will be noted automatically on the map.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS Age of Empires Be the First to Enter the Iron Age and Dominate Your Opponents by Elliott Chin GE OF EMPIRES is a wonderful game that has grabbed us as few games have. Although it certainly has its fair share of problems, there is no denying its addictive and fun gameplay. The game is at its best, though, when you are winning. And winning really isn't that difficult if you follow the strategies in this guide. My strategies definitely aren't the only approaches to victory, but they work convincingly for me when I compete with my fellow editors. There is a lot to cover, so this month, I'll explore how to get started and how to advance to each age as quickly as possible. I'll also provide a few more general tips. Next month, I'll let you in on more military strategies including how, when, and where to fightas well as tips on how to protect your Wonder and what to do if your enemy has you on the ropes. CLOSER To ensure the fastest resource gathering, build granaries and storage pits near resource deposits to cut down on the distance villagers need to travel to deposit their loads. Age Advancement Once you've specified scenario parameters, it's time to start building an empire. Lets assume you all start in the Stone Age. The key is to advance through the ages as quickly as possible. Stone Age: First, have one villager build two houses, send the other villagers to find wood and food, and start cranking out half a dozen villagers. You should have a population of 8-10 and have two of them chopping wood and the rest gathering food. Make sure you build your granary next to the berry bushes, and your storage pit next to the trees and stone. It isn't necessary to build a barracks as your first building. It is unlikely that your opponents will be able to mount an offensive this carly in the game, and you want to devote your energies to advancing as quickly as possible. If you are playing on an island map, build a granary and dock first, Build two fishing boats to supplement your work force and start fishing Pick Your Fights he first thing to do when playing AGE OF EMPIRES with others is to decide the game parameters. Some gamers like the full tech-tree option because it allows you the breadth of the game's research and building options. However, this option eliminates all racial bonuses, and really takes some of the strategy out of the game. The next major considerations are the size and land-to-sea ratio of the map. the luxury of building, choose large These two factors will define your maps. If you want to eliminate your strategies for the entire game. Choosing enemies quickly with military forces, either huge or large maps will allow you pick a small map. to build in relative peace, far away from Island scenarios might seem like a potential enemies, and will offer many good starting map for beginners, but resources. Smaller maps will start you that isn't the case. It's harder to reach closer to your enemies, which translates your opponent on an island map, which to more frequent enemy engagements might seem like a benefit for beginners and less plentiful resources. If you like who want to escape detection. However, CGW FEBRUARY 1998 "


"STRATEGY & TIPS: AGE OF EMPIRES GAMER'S EDGE Top 10 lps Food is vital to advancing through the ages, so make it your economic priority. In the Stone Age, 75 percent of your villagers should gather food while the rest gather wood. In subsequent ages, make sure you have at least six farms (nine is optimal) Build scouts or scoutships early, as soon as you advance to the Tool Age. You want to explore the map, not only for points, but also to find out where your opponents are. LORD OF THE FARM RING Keep the area around your granary or town center uncluttered so you can build an efficient-as-possible 3x3 farm grid with that building at the center. Upgrade your units as soon as possible, but not at the expense of age advancement. Usually it's best to upgrade weapons and armor for only your most plentiful unit type, saving the rest of the food for advancement. Once you hit the Bronze Age, you can start to upgrade your units more frequently. By building boats to gather food, you won't have to divert food to build villagers. If you concentrate on food, you should have the necessary stockpile in under 10 minutes to advance to the Tool Age. Tool Age: Once in the Tool Age, it's time to beef up your infrastructure. Immediately build a market and a stable. You'll probably need to have two villagers stop foraging and start chopping wood, for a total of four woodcutters. Once the market is finished, have the remaining foragers build farmis. You should have 6-9 farms. It's important to not build haphazardly. You need to construct an efficient town that minimizes the distance a villager has to walk from a farm to a granary. Farmers deposit their food in a granary or town center, so ring either building with farms, building them one or two tiles apart from each other and the depository. During the Tool Age, you want to build two to three morc houses and start cranking out a dozen more villagers to start gathcring wood, stone, and gold. At this time, food should still be your first priority among resources, with wood, stone, and gold following, respectively. Even as you concentrate on your economy, it's essential now to build scouts and explore the land. Not only do you want to gain the most points for exploration, but you also want to find out where your opponents are and keep tabs on their progress, Scouts also help alert you when an enemy approaches. At the same time you are scouting, you should be researching walls and towers at the granary. I wouldn't recommend spend ing food on many troops at this juncture of the game, so towers make the most sense for providing protection for your budding empire. Place towers next to all your resource-rich areas to protect your resources and villagers. Engage your opponents early. Do not create a big army and attack. Instead, create small skirmish forces of three to four units (preferably swift cavalty), and harass enemy camps on a regular basis. You'll not only increase your points by racking up kills, you'll also gauge your opponent's military strength, set him back a little in production by killing his villagers, and force him to divert resources and villagers away from age advancement to military defense. If you choose not to attack early, at least maintain adequate defenses so that you don't get overrun. Build towers to protect your vital resource areas, and wall off your settlement. Begin these detensive maneuvers as early as the Tool Age. As with all things, you need to exercise discretion so you don't divert too many farmers to stone mining. if you are playing with experts, they will find a way onto your island. In contrast, it will be hard for you to mount a sea offense and transport troops to an expert enemy's island, something you may have to do if he builds a Wonder. My advice is to keep things simple for beginners and play with inland maps. Assuming equal skill among all opponents, though, inland maps are best for those players who want to attack early. Lastly, know your opponent and adjust your strategies accordingly. If you know that your human opponents like to play defensively and build huge economies, attack them early and cripple their empire during the Bronze or Tool Age. This will surprise and thwart them. If they play offensively, and attack early, then you will have to build towers early and keep a few infantry handy even during the Tool Age. Check the achievement tab frequent Lily to see the breakdown of your opponents scores and to see where you need to improve your points. If you find yourself losing points in economy because FEBRUARY 1998 CGW "


"STRATEGY & TIPS: AGE OF EMPIRES GAMER'S EDGE your enemy has the villager high bonus, you can just create enough villagers to steal the bonus away. Or, if your opponent has the exploration bonus, you can see just how much more of the map you need to explore to take away that bonus as well. Not only will you increase your points, but you'll also gain a stronger work force and more intelligence, respectively. Checking the achievements tab and compensating for your point deficiencies will help you and hurt the game's current leader. Take advantage of the user controls. Assuming that you have smart opponents, speed becomes the deciding factor in determining who wins the game and who loses. Use waypoints and assign numbers to your troops for better coordination, and use the hot-keys to jump to buildings and create units. HARASS 'EM Even though it will slow your advancement schedule, you should harass your enemies during the Bronze Age to stunt their progress. Don't clump all your buildings togethwer, and separate buildings by type. It's best to have the military buildings on the outskirts of your town, and build your farms and granary away from the barracks. Houses should be buried in the back of your town, away from where enemies would approach. Leave at least one or two-space paths between buildings so villagers won't get caught walking between buildings. It might seem difficult to conduct all these actions at the same time, but during lulls in the game, such as when you are waiting for villagers to finish building towers, you can upgrade your weapons at the storage pit and your villagers at the market. Don't get too upgrade-happy because you don't want to drain your food surplus too much and delay advancement to the Bronze Age. I recommend researching woodworking for better wood-gathering, tool-working, and armor for your scouts. During the Tool Age, you simply want to ainass enough food to advance yet another age. For both ages, your strategy should still be very food-oriented, meaning that you must concentrate on stockpiling food for eventual advancement to the Bronze Agc. Bronze Age: Once you hit the Bronze Age, you shouldn't relax your pace of farming, but you should balance your focus. During the Bronze Age, if you haven't adjusted your work force, you should have about 20 villagers, with nine farming, and the rest split evenly among gathering gold, wood, and stone. You might want to build a few more villagers and apply them to goldmining so you can advance to the Iron Age quickly. build a minimum of buildings again, so you don't have to divert villagers away from food and gold gathering to cut wood. I recommend builling the Government Center and either a Temple or an Academy. When you build structures, assign additional villagers to the task to speed up the construction. Two villagers will build twice as fast, three will build three times as fast, and so on. Wonder (30Y.CH Three words: Food, food, food.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: AGE OF EMPIRES GAMER'S EDGE Understanding agers Ensemble provided us with two tables that show how fast villagers will work at their given tasks, as well as how technological discoveries will modify their work rate. During this age, it's important to begin upgrading more frequently, starting with Market upgrades, like gold mining, stone mining, domestication, plow, wheel, and artisanship. You also want to upgrade your units at the Storage Pit in anticipation of either offensive maneuvers or defensive commitments. During this age, different players will begin to manifest different strategies. Defensive players will now want to wall off their entire empire and crank out villagers to maximize resource gathering for the Iron Age and eventual Wonder building. Offensive players will shift their focus to the military and start building troops to harass the enemy If you choose to remain defensive and continue on the economic route, you will advance quickly, but you can bet your enemies will also be entering the Bronze or Iron Age soon. My strategy, rather than allowing my enemies to match my pace, is to go on the offensive and harass them to slow their progress, while beefing up my villager production to compensate for the war effort. If you embark on the harassment strategy, you obviously won't advance as swiftly as you would have if you remained isolated. However, the trade-off is worth it, since you will set your opponent back. Whatever your focus, though, don't lose sight of the Iron Age. Whoever advances first to this last age will maintain the advantage. Iron Age: Finally, you've reached the pinnacle of civilization. Don't let up. If you don't have 12 houses by now, make sure you build them. Then, make sure you have a villager population approaching 30. You can now relax your food production and apply your villagers as needed. Build the rest of the Bronze and Iron Age buildings, and spread your villagers evenly among wood, stone, food, and gold. If you want to build a Wonder, divert half your farmers and add them evenly to the work forces gathering wood, stone, and gold. Once you start building your Wonder, devote your entire work force to the effort. It will significantly speed up the process. If you choose a military route to victory, delete whatever villagers you need to make room for troops.

Aircraft Carriers: These monstrosities are a floating metal-donation waiting to be delivered to your opponent. Since aircraft have unlimited range, and can patrol open ocean indefinitely, there is little reason to provide them with a large, undergunned, and vulnerable platform from which to operate. The aircraft repair ability is nice, but in contested airspace, your jets will usually be blasted to bits the moment they slow down to land.

While most opponents will be wise enough to set up fierce defenses consisting of missile/ laser towers, AA Bots, missile tanks, and fighter CAP (especially CORE players, whose fighters have the edge in maneuverability), if you have the time, you can construct an airborne hammer and anvil that can crush even the best base, You prepare the hammer by first building your sacrificial distraction flight of recon aircraft. Fly your bombers out in groups of two or three to safe spots away from the enemy base, far enough away from each other to create several attack vectors when they come in. Send up your fighters to orbit just outside enemy AA range to try to draw off enemy CAP before the attack. The tricky part is keeping all of these groups on separate Ctrl keys, so you can take control and redirect them quickly. This will be the anvil. The hammer is composed of four to six gunships, all waiting on the deck for the attack to begin. When your initial bomber rush-with fighter cover and decoy screen of recon planes-begins its first pass, take control of your gunships and hit the enemy base hard and fast. Hose down every defense tower in sight, one after another, with the gunships' incredible firepower. With a lot of skill and a bit of luck, you can ravage the enemy base defenses before your bombers come back for a second pass, Once the big guns are down, use your remaining gunships to destroy anything under construction before moving onto the construction facilities themselves. Even if your big air strike is eventually destroyed, the damage it does will leave things wide open for your ground units—which are now rushing forward, because you are a tactical genius.

The game's lack of skirmishers makes a column formation even more vulnerable than usual. When your forces are defending, you can capitalize on this weakness by forcing enemy columns and artillery batteries to deploy earlier than they would like. Here, a single Confederate regiment has caused most of the Union attack column at Blackburn's Ford to deploy several hundred yards away from the crucial edge of a rise. Artillery can't change formation and move on the same turn, so this Confederate unit can move quickly to safety. Meanwhile, the main Rebel body has time to prepare a warm reception for the Yanks, once the enemy troops finally move up to the rise. B Z A Left Cisex (LC) Torslt Dela FRAU CGW FEBRUARY 1998 "

Action 50 K4 2. 0 ATOMIC BOMBERMAN S0 K0 50 NO 10 S1 K0 SO K0 50 10 :0 1:58 Simulations/Space eta IF-16 A target for a laser-guided weapon can be selected either directly, with LANTIRN, or indirectly, by using the F-16's ground radar modes. Because it presents more information, radar is invariably faster and easier to use. The biggest problem with using radar is that if the target moves off the radar scope, the weapon, which requires target illumination all the way till impact, will lose lock. The best solution is to first designate the desired target on radar, then bring up the LANTIRN FLIR MFD mode and deactivate your radar. With radar on standby, LANTIRN's laser designator will remain trained on the correct target--even after you have overflown it. Cluster bombs are excellent weapons for dealing with groups of ground vehicles, but only when used correctly. Your goal should OFFENSIVE TIPS 1. Greed kills. Watch for opponents going for power-ups in short halls with one way in and no comers to hide behind When an enemy goes for the power-up, seal him in with a single bomb. 2. When an opponent stops to wait for a bomb to go off, he may be vulnerable. Cauge how much time remains before the bomb explodes and act as though you are trying to get out of the bombs path by turning toward your opponent (who has stopped moving). Then surround him with bombs before he realizes that you are attacking and not hiding 3. Got lots of flame enhancements? Players on one side of the screen may not pay any mind to bombs dropped on the other side, and may risk moving in the bombs' path. Works great with the orange flame power-up 4. Jelly bombs make everyone nervous. No one knows exactly when, or, more importantly, where they are going to blow. 5. The timer is the best power-up in the game. Not just because you can set it off when people walk past it, but also because you can use it to set off other players' bombs before they are safely out of the way. Note this example: Two players are at a standoff and repeatedly run up to each other, drop a bomb, and then hide around a corner. If one has a timer, he can set his bomb off the second he is out of the way, setting the other player's bomb off early. When used with the kick, this works even better. Finally, when used with the boxing glove or the blue hand, the timer can set off a bomb where everyone least expects it. UCRU Dy the list. DEFENSIVE TIPS 1. Even if you are in a direct line from a bomb and have no way out, still run as far away as possible; you never know exactly how far the bombs reach will be 2. When you're sealed in by multiple bombs on two or more sicles, move next to the one dropped last. If the bombs aren't connectedand you hide from the blast of the first oneyou may be able to get out of the way of the second by escaping down the path previously blocked by the first. 3. See a power-up you want? If it is in an easily sealed area, put a bomb in a place that will block off the area from other players, but won't seal you in at the same time. Then pick up the power-up and wait for your own bomb to go off. 4. Plenty of obstacles between you and the nearest opponent? Sometimes you're better off blowing away your side of the screen looking for power-ups) than charging straight for the nearest enemy 5. Just starting out? Always look for the spot where your bombs can hit the most blocks. Linking bombs (so the flames from one bomb set off another bomb) also helps clear away large areas quicklythis is very dangerous with four or more bombs. be to generate a broad pattern of bomblets that is dense enough to kill almost every thing within the target area. First, don't fly too fast (350-400 knots is about right) or the pattern will be too long, producing many gaps in the coverage. Second, don't trust the bombing system-it will almost always tell you to drop too early, resulting in the bomblet storm either barely reaching or even falling short of the aim point. Practice until you learn how much lead-time is necessary Gun kills in iF-16 are surprisingly easy once you learn to trust the EEGS funnel. Put a fighter-sized target near the small end in a stable turn for just a second, then hold down the trigger as you pull the bandit through the bottom of the funnel-BOOM!

"MARTIN CIRULIS what wot, ME What's the Deal With...the Wrong Lessons? stupid ads. If it weren't for games such as HEXEN, which tried to improve upon the game environ ment, I would have sworn that the letters D.O.OM created some sort of lobotomizing neurological feedback in anybody high up enough in a game company to make design calls. The wackiness doesn't end there...What lesson did the industry get from TOMB RAIDER? \"Gamers wanna see big, 3D breasts!\" e're reveling in the tra ditional fall quarter frenzy as I write this, with title after title vying to be the hot new thing; or, more accurately, trying to successfully clone what made last year's hit the hot thing it was. While it's useless to bemoan the lack of originality in computer games (or movies, books, or cars) in this demographically driven society, what never ceases to amaze me is the utter inability of some portions of the industry to buy a clue, even when the truth is staring them in the face. Just look at the Doom bandwagon-jumping. I mean, Doom was huge for pretty much two rea sons: multiplayer capability and creepy game envi. ronments. Now, it's pretty safe to say that the industry has gotten the message about network and Internet capability even LucasArts has added it to JEDI KNIGHT (though by ignoring co-op multiplay they stubbornly refuse to complete the picture). But the real genius of Doom was shown in its moody atmosphere (who can forget their first sight of those four demon lords staked to the walls? You just knew some serious bad mojo was about to go down...), its coherent sound (the heavy breathing of monsters just on the other side of the door), and its truly chaotic battlefields (with foes that would go blood-crazy and kill everything in their path). But what's really laughable is that executives, and even some designers, looked at that genius and the les son they learned was \"Duh...gamers want more blood and more Satan.\" The result is no surprise: a horde of forgettable games that did little except generate some really LC What lesson did the industry get from TOMB RAIDER? \"Gamers wanna see big, 3D breasts!' 77 can give you, it will sell the same number of copies as the cartridge game. Of course, it doesn't occur to any of them that when you have just spent $3,000 on a rig, you are looking for something a little more in-depth than jumping for coins. (Those of us who actually paid money for ULTIMA VIII, feel free to mutter bitterly at this point.) This whole \"PC gamers crave simplicity\" delusion is staging a strong battle on the real-time front as well. I cannot believe that the guys at SSI (who gave the okay for DARK COLONY) could have come away from COMMAND & CONQUER thinking, \"That's it! The key to real-time wargaming is a limited number of units, no-brainer base building, and some really incoherent and violent animated cut-scenes!\" Nobody says your designs have to embody originality every time a new one hits the page, but for the love of Xerox, at least try to clone the good parts. can only pray that somebody out there is busy right now picking out the best aspects of DARK REIGN, TOTAL ANNIHILATION and the whole research/ design engine from WAR INC. Unfortunately, I suspect that, instead, somebody in a sharp suit is showing a screenshot from CONQUEST EARTH to a roomful of horrified programmers while saying, \"This is the direction we need to go on this project.\" And of course, there isn't even a point in going into all the wrong answers that game companies brought away from the whole Myst experience. Are salaries paid in inverse proportion to competency in this industry? Maybe it's our fault. C'mon, own up to it out there! Are you secretly turning in feedback cards, written in crayon, that say \"Orgo not like game...make brain hurt with complexity and my guy not punch out spleens\"? After all, there has to be some reason that companies keep learning the wrong lessons from the right games Another great \"wrong answer\" making its way through the industry is that the huge sales num bers for console games have nothing to do with the fact that the game systems cost less than $200 Instead, the powers that be have decided that it must be because cartridge games are pretty and simple..that must be what gamers want! They assume that if they have a computer game that is indistinguishable from a cartridge game, and does away with all that annoying potential a keyboard Computer Gaming World (ISSN 0744-6667) is published monthly by Zitt-Davis, Ing One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016.
