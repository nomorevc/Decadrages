"Patch Adams Syndrome Why Do the Opinions of Critics and Gamers Diverge? EDITORIAL focus is used in the camera obscura scenes in Addicted to Love or a brown filter is used in The Godfather. It helps me enjoy the film more. This translates pretty well into the game business. At CGW, we like to share a little about some of the tools and the techniques being used in various games. We love to Second, Levy cites the scope of the critic's view. He observes that critics see close to 10 movies per week. Naturally, this is a doubleedged sword. They get a broader perspective than the average moviegoer, but they are also particularly susceptible to the kind of freshness that breaks up conventions which have become cliché. This is fine if the audiences, too, are tired of the conventions, but can be bad when the critics are too far out in front of the audience in declaiming that which is passé. The upside is that these critics can compare elements of films or techniques in films with those of other films. Comparison helps me make up my own mind. In game criticism, I particularly like critics repetitive sequences. Gamers who have plenty of time to tweak their setups or find workarounds may be more forgiving. Hence, our readers sometimes perceive us as whining or being overly picky. Yet, someone needs to hold game publishers to a higher standard. If we reviewers let them slide, who will get the publishers' attention. Levy suggested that the thoughtful and thought-provoking observations of film critics helped both the film going public and the professionals to think about movies differently. It is certainly to be hoped that game critics offer some of the same kinds of leaven to the design process. So, in answer to my son's question, critics may not be any smarter Critics are like eunuchs in a harem.... Brendan Behan y 16-year-old son gets really annoyed over my attention to film reviews. \"How do those guys know any more about whether it's a good movie or not than you do?\" he asks ingenuously. \"You should just make up your own mind.\" I have tried to explain that I don't read reviews for the \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down,\" but he feels that I pay too much attention to a bunch of clowns who claim to know more than I do. He's in pretty good company with his skepticism. He agrees with Irish author Brendan Behan who said, \"Critics are like eunuchs in a harem. They're there every night, they see it done every night, they see how it's done every night, but they can't do it themselves.\" About two days after our last such conversation (he was annoyed that I had enjoyed Shakespeare in Love), I read a fascinating piece by Shawn Levy of the Newhouse News Service. Levy asked why critics almost universally panned Patch Adams, but audiences almost universally loved it. Not only did the piece give me some ammo for my continuing debate with my son, but it also resonates with my experience as a game critic Levy's first point is that critics are more in touch with technique and approach than the average film viewer. He points out how the techniques used in both the screenplay and direction of Patch Adams are contrived to wring superficial and maudlin sentimentality out of the audience. It reminded me that I like film reviewers who are well-versed in the bodies of work belonging respectively to director, screenwriter, and major star. I like reviewers who tell me why a certain soft talk to design teams about AI philosophy and look at the artistic development of a game from concept sketches through prototyping to finished characters and backgrounds. We think this information assists in the enjoyment of the game, as well as in helping gamers decide if the game meets their preferences or not who are willing to learn about underlying physics models, lighting models, Al schemes, sound technology, art techniques, and engine design. They just add more to the discussion of the elements. Due to deadline pressure, reviewers also tend to have very low thresholds of patience with poor interfaces, prepatch bugs, and than the general public, but they have access to more information and are exposed to a broader scope of the gaming horizon than the average viewer or gamer. I also have to admit that they aren't \"right\" all the time. Yet, right or wrong, reviews provide a fascinating starting point for discussions and debates. CGW The Big Trade ecause I've been identified in the same breath with CGW for so long, I feel a little bit like an athlete who's been playing every day and suddenly got a chance to move into a coaching role. I'm still putting shots on goal, but I feel like I need to start coaching before I start losing that infamous slap shot from the blue line. Of course, new coaches need new talent. We already have a great team of editors, but we needed the right guy to center our first line. We got our first choice. Everybody knows George Jones. The one-time Sports and Action editor at CGW managed to move his way into the editorial version of the Top Scorers list after moving to C/Net's Gamecenter and showing what he can do. George is a terrific gamer. He loves this industry and he loves this magazine. He's got some bold new ideas and he knows our playing style. He wants a championship ring. He's hungry. He's already proving himself as a great team leader. He's awesome! Computer Gaming World will change under George's leadership, but it will be because he takes it to another level. Meanwhile, you'll still have to put up with my ugly mug in these pages and, if you're in the industry, you might see me standing behind the bench as l occasionally whisper a few ideas in George's ear. In spite of this change, one thing will stay the same. Computer Gaming World is and will continue to be the best computer game magazine in the business. We are the champions-even if the highest-priced player moves behind the bench. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1999 21 "

"Wire Head ATKIN Wire Head You Can Have My Cable Modem When You Pry It From My Cold, Dead Hands uninstall and erase it. Web brows ing is a whole new experience. Many Web pages just appear, complete with pictures, rather than stream in. And gaming is greatly improved, not just by the faster speed but also by the reduced latency. I hosted a five-player COMBAT FLIGHT SIM game, and it ran far smoother than when it was played over a 56K connection. you share bandwidth with other users. That's why I didn't want anyone in my local area to read this column-the more people who get cable modems, the slower the connection for everyone. If everyone on your cable line hits the net at the same time to download TOMB RAIDER XIV: THE SAGGING, you'll see an appreciable decrease in performance. So sign up, but don't tell all your friends. My neighbor apparently had his cable modem installed the week before mineI'm going to start blaring Starland Vocal Band 8-tracks at night to drive that bandwidth-sucker away! There are different types of cable connections in different areas. Some are bidirectional, so there's no need for a separate phone line for your Internet sheer number of users trying to grab it may slow your download to the same speed that others get via phone modem. And really busy Web sites that are dog-slow on a phone modem probably won't be any faster over cable. Cable modems are putting the pressure on the phone companies to introduce high-speed technologies such as xDSL, which will offer similarly amazing Internet access. No matter what high-speed connection you choose, once you've tried it, there's no going back. For more on cable modems and other high-speed communications technologies, check out our networking feature on page 106 of this issue. So if you don't live in Contra Costa County, bug your local cable provider and see if cable modem f you live in Contra Costa County, California, there's nothing to interest you in my column. Really. Just turn to Terry Coleman's treatise on the potential of turn-based 3D shooters, or skip to the back and read Jeff Green's cathartic realization that he wishes he was a booth babe. Nothing to read here. Move along, please. Okay, now that those guys are gone, I can tell you about a piece of technology available now to some of you that will redefine the way you game in the future. (Hey you, in Concord, I see you still reading. Quick, turn to page 86! There's a secret tip there that will show you how to find the free copy of FALCON 4.0 hidden on the TOP GUN: FIRE AT WILL disc.) Good. Now that we've gotten rid of him—and a few dozen other gullible people-let's talk about cable modems. A few weeks ago the friendly folks from TCI @Home came by my place and installed this wonderful piece of new technology. They just attached a splitter to the cable behind my TV, hooked in the cable modem they provided, and connected an Ethernet cable to my PC's network card. After configuring a few TCP/IP settings on my network card, I had a direct connection to the Internet. And what a connection! When downloading files on my 56K v.90 modem, I'd average a little over 4KB/sec on a good connection. At work, where we have a T1 connection, I'd get what I thought was an impressive 20KB/sec file transfer. Now, I know cable modems are fast, but I was unprepared for the transfer rates I got: more than 500KB/sec from some servers! There are numerous benefits to this kind of speed. The most obvious is file transfer: I was able to download the 26MB demo of TRESPASSER in about a minute-not much more time than it took to Sign up for a cable modem, but don't tell all your friends. service is available. If you do live there, I can get you a great deal on a slightly used 56K gem... CGW Short ping times will also give 3D connection. But in other locales, shooter players a decided edge. you receive data over cable and GameSpy, for example, showed send via modem. That's still fine for more than a dozen QUAKE Il servers Web browsing and file transfer, but with ping times under 30ms. it can significantly increase your So what are the disadvantages gaming ping times. of cable modems? The most signifiAlso, no cable modem will speed cant is that the connection works the Internet itself.

Set him straight at denny_atkin@zd.com. t seems like such a simple idea: Take those protec tive flexible plastic keyboard covers found in some offices and print the controls for popuo lar flight sims on them, making it dramatically easier to find the right key in combat. It actually took two years of engineering to develop a cover that would fit multiple keyboard sizes, with ink that wouldn't rub off. The result, though, was well worth the effort. Cockpit Collection Keyboard Control Covers come designed for a variety of sims, including the LONGBOW series, COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR, and F22 ADF. Templates are also in the works for FALCON 4.0 and other recent sims. At $14.95, they're reasonably priced, and they can be lifesavers when you suddenly forget which key is used for flares in the sim you're flying. During sessions with the LONGBOW 2 template, I actually found myself using functions I'd previously ignored. For more information, check out www.cockpitcollection.com. 24 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"World Turned Upside Down Controversy and Untimely Death Are the Order of the Day In any case, the SSG folks are hedging their bets by continuing the acclaimed turn-based WARLORDS franchise as well, though this game will be a year 2000 project at the earliest. Imagine the cross-promotion possibilities: \"When the evil necromancer raises skeletal soldiers from the ranks of the dead, cast a Y2K spell to freeze his hapless minions in place! Only on the Intel Pentium Ill processor! (Coming soon for the system. Obviously some features change to accommodate the pace of play, including the scale and combat, but the WARLORDS game play translates well. In WARLORDS, the heroes and allies combine to produce powerful stacks or squads. We will maintain this important gameplay feature as well as increase the depth of some features like the hero and magic system.\" SG's WARLORDS II was the best fantasy game available until WARCRAFT II, and both WARLORDS III and its sequel, DARKLORDS RISING, showed that there was still plenty of life (and unit sales) left in turnbased strategy. So, it's definitely a bit of a bombshell that SSG's upcoming WARLORDS PROPHECY game will be real-time strategy This situation was not, I've been assured, brought about by any pressure from Red Orb/Broderbund/SSI/The Learning Co./ Mattel/ Barbie & Ken/Ken Starr/Mindscape, or anyone else. The SSG folks just feel that there are lots of avenues in real-time strategy gaming that have yet to be explored. And while SSG hasn't mentioned specifics, certain obvious improvements come to mind. For example, it would be great to play a real-time game with a master like SSG's Roger Keating doing the Al, instead of the usual \"Gee, my unit actually strategic vision and verbally killed the project. Afterward, Fenris shopped the game around and was in discussion with Wizardworks (ironically, an affiliate of GT) to use the REVOLUTION engine for a Vietnam squad-level 3D game. However, as GT had never signed documents legally freeing Fenris from its obligation, the talks with Wizardworks stalled. Months later (February '99). Fenris sued GT, claiming breach of contract. The only official response from GT thus far has been to ask that the trial take place in Minnesota Federal Court. Our inside sources at GT, however, informed me that GT was concerned about the graphics and general polish of the game. If true, it seems odd that GT couldn't have provided a few more art resources-a common practice with most publishers—to The Revolution Is Dead Fenris Wolf is a small company that likes to follow its own muse, whether it's designing an MMXonly game or employing voice technology to control game units-both of which they accomplished in REBEL MOON and its sequels. Fenris' latest project was REBEL MOON REVOLUTION, a hybrid sci-fi affair that had the potential to bridge the gap It's a bit of a bombshell that WARLORDS PROPHECY will be real-time strategy. Planned features for WARLORDS PROPHECY: More than 60 fully animated units Expansive magic system featuring over 60 spells  Extensive hero development system Seven races Four broad classes, with 15 specialty classes  20+ levels of advancement Four basic stats and 10 skills Four resources with no micromanagement  12 ways to win the game save what seems to have been for years a good publisher/developer relationship The worst part, of course, is that regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit (assuming there's any substantial money left after the lawyers take their share), another game with great potential has vanished from sight, due to all the time lost. And every time some thing like this happens-regardless of whose fault it is the chances decrease that a publisher will take a chance on a small developer with a fresh idea. C'est la vie.

Plus, the WARLORDS universe has been nicely fleshed out over the past decade, so we'll certainly have a nice back-story for the campaign. Whether it'll equal STARCRAFT's remains to be seen.

The hero system, magic system, group bonuses, and underlying combat system all meld well in a real-time between 3D shooters and tactical wargames like Squad Leader. For a number of reasons, REVOLUTION is dead.

"COMPUTER WORLD PUBLISHER WRITE US, DAMMIT! CGWLETTERS@ZD.COM Lee Uniacke EDITORIAL MISFITS Editorial Director Johnny Wilson Editor-in-Chief George Jones THE VAMPIRE COVER e received your April issue today, and both my husband and I were appalled at what we saw. If we wanted our children to be exposed to Playboy-type magazines, we would buy them for them. But we choose magazines that are appropriate for them. Did anyone in your editorial department think that maybe this is not good for kids? I am so tired of women being used to sell things, and I am so tired of businesses not really caring about what is good for our youth. I am disappointed in you. Joy Nadeau, Middle School Teacher Via the Internet We received more letters concerning our April cover than any previous issue. Most were from angry parents who thought the image wasn't suitable for children. Since none of the parents said violent images in CGW were inappropriate, we assume it's okay for children to see disfigurement but not the female form. Given the magazine's predominantly male, 30-year-old readership, we thought the cover image was appropriate for our audience. Apart from the blood (she is a vampire), it's no different than what appears on the cover of other popular men's magazines for women's magazines). Still, if it shocked you, you weren't alone.

I don't want my children exposed to scantily clad females with fangs, demonic eyes, and bleeding vampire bites on the neck. Bill Liddell Your cover for the April 1999 issue was...daring, to say the least. I had hoped that CGW would not stoop to the level of certain other sophomoric, awash-intestosterone game magazines. Now, enjoy looking at magnificent expanses of luscious female flesh just as much as the next guy, but not in my hardcore, serious, and dare I say it, mature computer game magazine, If you want to compete with those other locker-room dwelling game magazines, do it with intelligent, honest reviews, more indepth coverage of the games and the gaming industry, and insightful commentary from knowledgeable editors...not with the size of your cover model's breasts. (Of course, this issue will probably be your best selling ever, so what do I know?) Scott Sanpietro Via the Internet I was forced to keep my April issue rolled up as I walked from my school mailbox to my room. Usually I can flaunt my CGW with such geekish pride, but this issue's cover belongs on a Larry Flynt publication. After careful...er, analysis...of the cover (ahem) I realized that the lady's cleavage was as big as her face! Granted, these pictures have their place (under pillows, etc.), but not on the cover of a respectable gaming magazine.

ME Quake III: Arena Will Bring Multiplayer Carnage to the Masses Chunke of ARIS UNLIST fter some heartfelt quality time mowing each other down at id's Dallas offices, we are happy to report that the multiplayer focus of ARENA seems to be paying off. Its inventive level design, bruising action, and sense of blistering speed are more in line with the original QUAKE than QUAKE II. Slipping free of the shackles of traditional single-player game design has let the team focus on creating some of the best DeathMatch maps we've ever seen. One head-to-head map was choked with opponentconcealing volumetric fog, giving the cozy killing ground an even tenser, more claustrophobic feel. Larger levels are even wilder. One standout featured a slew of player-accelerating bouncing pads that fling combatants across vast stretches of bottomless space onto hovering platforms-all the better to frag the targets below. With the focus squarely on DeathMatch, id is designing the game to ease newbies into the online warzone that is the QUAKE community. To that end, gamers will battle daunting armies of bots as they gun their way through the game's maps, hopefully develop ing the skills to compete against other humans along the way. The bots will adjust to QUAKE III: ARENA's new engine permits curved surfaces and more each player's skill, organic environments such as this. thus offering a sig. nificant challenge while still allowing ARENA with two tournaments. One dedicated, if mediocre, gamers to tournament will be exclusively for finish the game.

Billed as a festival of \"peace, love, and games,\" Gamestock attracted no less than three CGW editors, who traveled to the event in hopes of rolling around naked in the mud, but instead found themselves sitting through long game demos, eating Rice Krispie treats, and avoiding the Seattle rain. The event did succeed, nevertheless, in reaffirming Microsoft's rising status as a major player in the gaming world, as they unveiled a host of promising titles.

How's that for a recommendation? READ. ME Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings Feudal, and Imperial Ages. Everything that made AGE OF EMPIRES cool is still there, but a number of enhancements are making this game a fresh expe. rience. These include better production queues, gathering points, a global trade system, troop formations, and the ability to put defensive units inside towers and other buildings. Due this Fall, AGE OF EMPIRES II is the clear can't-miss hit in Microsoft's stable. Microsoft Football Presumed dead or at least missing in action for over a year now, Microsoft's first football game is in fact still alive and kicking-and actually looks good. Fully licensed with all the NFL teams and stadiums (including the \"new\" Cleveland Browns), MICROSOFT FOOTBALL (a working title) is emphasizing arcade play over simulation, and the game's developers are talking the good talk about dealing with one of the perennially weak aspects of PC football games: the poor running game. Fluid 3D animation and a clean, accessible interface made this look good on a purely aesthetic level-we'll get back to you later on to see just how well it actually plays. 5, 10, and 15 Years Ago in CGW What We Were Writing About While You Were in Diapers 15 Years Ago: JUNE 1984 In June 1984 (there was no May issue that year) we were excited about JUPITER MISSION 1999, touted as having \"11 different proprams which combine arcade seg. ments, puzzles, and adventure elements to make a challenging game. As far as we know, there are no plans to send humans to Jupiter this year, but the era of 'kitchen sink' games is defi. nitely in full force.\" 10 Years Ago: MAY 1989 In May 1989, Johnny Wilson (then merely an associate editor) gushes about SIMCITY and also makes his hopeful plea for future Maxis titles: \"SimCounty, SimState, SimNation, SimPlanet, SimUniverse...\" Well, our in-house oracle didn't even get one title right, but they did come close to satisfying his request for \"billions and billions of games.\" 5 Years Ago: MAY 1994 It took over four years from when we printed our cover story in May, 1994 for BATTLECRUISER 3000 A.D. to ship in a COMETER woefully buggy unfinished state: The designer, Derek Smart claimed that \"you can literally have a game that goes on for well over a year!\" That would mean they'd only had time to play-test it about four or five times since then, so give 'em a break. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Conquest: Frontier Wars Another crowd-pleaser among the gaming press, CONQUEST: FRONTIER WARS is one of the first games coming from Chris Roberts' (of WING COMMANDER fame) Digital Anvil development house. The game is a 3D real-time strategy game set in outer space. You'll play one of two unique races set on the usual course of exploration and combat. In the eye candy department, the develop ers showed off some truly stunning special effects, while also demonstrating a very sophisticated 3000 studier Freelancer The big eyebrow-raiser of the show, FREELANCER is a Chris Roberts (the same WING COMMANDER guy) design that gave us a glimpse as to what the future of gaming will be like. An outer-space action/adventure in the grand tradition of ELITE and PRIVATEER, FREELANCER casts you as an interstellar mercenary in the far-flung future and challenges you to make like Han Solo...or Boba Fett. You'll buy merchandise low, sell it high, and cover your back the whole way. If our initial impressions hold true, this sci-fi game will have the sense of style and cinematic flair rarely seen in computer gamesthe opening sequence of the demo we saw depicted an impressive cityscape boasting ships that dart back and forth across the screen. In an interesting departure from the normally joystick-jockey mode of this genre, FREELANCER will be a primarily mouse-driven game, with an emphasis on cutting to the fun parts of the game.

NBA DRIVE 2000 looks like an intelligent, fairly realistic arcade-style basketball game with a nice feel. The game's big problem, of course, is the fact that it must compete with EA Sports' humon* NBA Drive 2000 gous, and so far unchallenged, NBA LIVE franchise. To that end, Microsoft is playing it smart by pricing it at a bargain-bin $19.95 in hopes of attracting casual sports fans. (The same strategy is being used for MICROSOFT BASEBALL 2000). Jeff's Pick www.oldmanmurray.com OldManMurray.com may be the funniest gaming Web site in existence, with biting, nasty, hilarious reviews that say all the things we're not allowed to say.

Loose Cannon Another game from Digital Anvil, LOOSE CANNON is a futuristic action/adventure game being designed by Tony Zurovec, creator of the now-classic CRUSADER: NO REMORSE and CRUSADER: NO REGRET games. This time around, you play a bounty hunter named Ashe in pursuit of a criminal overlord named Bishop over the course of about 20 long missions. The game's big selling point, besides Zurovec's track record, is the ability to choose at times whether to pursue your prey on foot or in one of 15 customizable vehicles. The drawback? It's not slated for release until Spring 2000. Ugh! Robert's Pick www.planethalflife.com The essential one-stop shop for everything HALF-LIFE related.

"SNEAK PREVIEWS Sci-Fi Sneak Spectacular YOUR BEST SOURCE FOR THE HOTTEST GAMES IN DEVELOPMENT Klingon Academy Is This the Star Trek Game We've Been Waiting For? this year. It looks as if it could be the rare Star Trek game that gets it right. by Robert Coffey uick-what was the last decent Star Trek game you played? GENERATIONS stank, DEEP SPACE NINE bit, KLINGON HONOR GUARD wasn't quite so honorable and THE SECRET OF VULCAN FURY is currently shopping for something in a nice granite headstone. Sometimes it seems as if the Star Trek license is heavily perfumed with the stink of death. That dubious record may all change with the release of Interplay's KLINGON ACADEMY later Really Deep Space The simple, almost arcadelike gameplay of Interplay's previous capital ship simulation, STARFLEET ACADEMY, alienated gamers who were thirsting for the challenge of commanding an enormous starship and its crew. To their credit, the design team from Interplay has taken many of the suggestions of gamers to heart, crafting a deep game with a host of options. While the focus of KLINGON ACADEMY is still squarely on the blowing up of enemy ships, options ranging from the simple charting of a course to reach your next engagement to the potentially complex allocation of ship resources among the seven ship systems provide a welcome degree of gameplay depth. Klingon Academy GENRE: Space Sim RELEASE DATE: Q3 '99 DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER: Interplay One of the most conspicuous areas of improvement will come in the increased interaction with your crew members. Work successfully through the missions and your crew becomes more effective; stumble through the challenges you face and your crew won't gain the experience necessary to deal with the more daunting missions in the game. You can almost think of the crew as another vital ship system, affecting your ship's performance and requiring your care and attention. If you're bombarded with radiation you'll need to shift system resources to your medical team, since dying crew members will impinge your ability to fight. As you gain prestige and glory you may attract elite officers that will provide bonuses in their specialties. The juggling of ship systems is not limited just to the crew-gamers will have to contend with several systems, including engineering, communications, security, and weapons. While micromanagers will relish the opportunity to tweak every ship setting, Interplay rightly recognizes that most gamers won't want to tinker in the midst of a raging battle. To that end, you'll be able to save engineering settings as hot-keyed macros, letting you bolster your shields at the expense of other systems with a single keystroke. Additionally, a streamlined, menu-driven \"Verbal Order System,\" complete with voice responses, will let you issue orders without switching to the big interface screens; instead, you'll just simply punch keys on the numpad. Shooting Stars While all the system modeling holds real appeal, the gakh and potatoes of the game lies in the 52 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1999 ,   "

Consisting of an emergency stop, full reverse, and emergency turn, these maneuvers—which are triggered by holding down a hot-key-should cut down on potential frustration. However, with the stress such radical moves generate, a cumulative BROKEN WING Fires ripping through its decks, its chance exists to overstress your saucer chewed up from heavy phaser fire, this ship, lose control, and tumble Federation starship will soon be history. helplessly through space. Mission Briefing KLINGON ACADEMY takes place just before the sixth Star Trek movie, with Christopher Plummer and David Warner reprising their roles as General Chang and Chancellor Gorkon, respectively. As a young recruit under Chang's tutelage, you'll spend the first half of the game's 25 missions in a simulator, preparing for actual combat in the civil war that comprises the second half of the game. You'll command seven ships during the game; however, all of the more than 50 Klingon, Federation, Romulan, Gorn, Star Trek: New Worlds Star Trek: New Worlds The Prime Directive is to Wipe Out the Other Guy GENRE: Real-Time Strategy RELEASE DATE: 04 '99 DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER: Interplay In a sense, STAR TREK: NEW WORLDS sets itself up as the Away Team of the Star Trek games-it leaves the infinite vastness of space to beam down to solid ground. Taking place entirely on the surface of various planets, NEW WORLDS is charting new territory in a game license that has heretofore been primarily used in adventure and space games. Boldly going into places where no Star Trek game has gone before is admirable but risky; hopefully, proper execution will prevent NEW WORLDS from facing the end that awaits those ill-fated members of the Away Tears in the please-kill-me red shirts. Based in the ciassic Star Trek universe, NEW WORLDS will embrace pretty much every convention of your standard real-time strategy title. Gamers will have up to 10 resources to collect and scads of units to build across three separate races (Federation, Klingon, and Romulan). Battles will take place across six different worlds uncovered during a failed Romulan experiment and will include volcanic planets, ice worlds, and sweeping deserts. A full 3D engine will power the game, and gamers will be able to control the camera à la MYTH. Since this is the first land-locked Star Trek game, the design team from Interplay has enjoyed a fairly free rein, in that they've been able to create a whole slew of never-before-seen units. But rest assured, purists, the new units will all be in keeping with Star Trek continuity, so that only the Romulans will enjoy the advantages of cloaking tanks. Missions will be race-specific and will ask gamers to both battle and ally with the opposing races. -Robert Coffey CGW www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. MAY 1999 53 "


"Sci-Fi Sneak Spectacular Conquest: Frontier Wars Digital Anvil Enters the Real-Time Space Race SNEAK PREVIEWS and Tholian vessels modeled in the game will be available for multiplayer action. Most missions will be offensive assaults, but there will be some that ask you to do more. For example, Chang will send you on a spy mission, asking you to warp a small cloaked ship near a space station and then use specialized equipment to eavesdrop on an important meeting. With proper timing and strategy the mission can be accomplished without firing a single shot. Missions won't necessarily be hard-andfast things either; in fact, the game encourages exploration by letting players investigate space sectors that are not strictly part of their mission assignment. Depending on your proximity to enemy territory and other factors, these little forays will randomly result in combat that will season your crew as long as you still accomplish your mission within a generous allotment of time. Interplay is taking great pains to add to the strategic portion of the game through generous use of terrain. Nebulae, black holes, asteroid belts-all will have separate and distinct effects on every ship system. For instance, nebulae can cause transporter mishaps (bad for boarding parties), severely disrupt sensors, and simply obscure vision. Battles fought in nebulae will be tense catand-mouse affairs, with ships effectively cloaked from each other—until a plasma leak betrays your enemy's position or you collide with a vessel emerging from a thick orange cloud. A new 3D engine delivers a game that is graphically stunning, with shifting, colored nebulae; brilliant explosions; crackling lightning; and ships that show visible damage right down to the layers of interior decks revealed as another precious chunk of hull is blown off. Suns are handled as light sources for the star systems, illuminating ships and casting shadows. More than just an eye. candy gimmick, the lighting will actually affect gameplay-battles on the edges of star systems far from suns will take place in inky darkness, with only the shipborne lights providing any illumination. By freeing gamers of the namby-pamby Federation and its Prime Directive and serving up a slew of gaming options and challenges, KLINGON ACADEMY may well be the first Star Trek game since JUDGMENT RITES to merit gamers' attention. We'll just have to wait until autumn to find out. CGW by Robert Coffey f it seems to you that the vast reaches of outer space are getting half vast and a little more crowded, you can blame the loss of intergalactic elbow room on the sudden increase in realtime strategy games set in far-off galaxies. Hoping to rise above the burgeoning pack is CONQUEST: FRONTIER WARS from Digital Anvil. While its epic starship battles may seem to echo HOMEWORLD, CONQUEST is actually more similar to World War II naval battles by way of STARCRAFT With its emphasis on exploration, resource gathering, and building, CONQUEST follows the standard RTS model. In the game, four different races (Terrans, the insectoid Mantis, the high-tech Solarians, and the bruising Vyrium) are battling for FOUR-WAY FRACAS With each of CONQUEST's four races space supremacy, with the two represented, this battlefield shows the typical scope of single-player campaigns telling the game's combat. the game's story from the unique perspectives of the Terran and Mantis races. Don't worry about being limited; alliances will be struck that will allow you to employ the units of all four races through the course of the game, and all races will be available for multiplayer contests. Fighting Smart So where does CONQUEST break away from the rest of the real-time copycats? For starters, there are the Fleet Commanders. Fleet Commanders are experienced units that you'll gain over the course of the game, allowing you to avoid aggravating micromanagement and to execute more nuanced tactics. In essence, the Fleet Commander is a player-friendly Al that will follow your orders and manage whatever ships you assign to their fleet, with mixed units automatically falling into strategic formations. Digital Anvil is putting a lot of time into refining the Fleet Commanders so they'll act intelligently, picking off weak targets and fleeing from battles if they're outgunned. In addition to attacking, your virtual admirals will also be able to conduct raids, patrol regions, and defend your interests.

There's one more thing to add to the mixartifact weapons. There are 30 such weapons in the program, though just a few will be available during the campaign game; the rest will see action in multiplayer games when four or five are randomly sprinkled in. The artifact weapons are a tantalizing deck of wild cards, including holo-projectors for creating phantom fleets, a jump-gate creator, and our favorite: a superbomb that destroys everything around it. Just load it onto a helpless corvette and launch a suicide run against your enemy. Homeworld HOMEWORLD Is Getting Close to Completion e've been waiting to get our grubby little paws on HOMEWORLD ever since we named it our Game of the Show at last year's E3. And while the game is undergoing some last-minute VV tweaking, it looks as if those long months of waiting are nearing an end. The game is fundamentally complete, but Relic Entertainment CEO and HOMEWORLD designer Alex Garden felt that more needed to be done with the single-player campaign in order to fulfill the game's promise. To that end, the game's story has become more interactive courtesy of some new, in-engine cut-scenes that move the plot out of the manual and onto gamers' monitors. More important, every single-player mission is undergoing intense scrutiny and fine-tuning in order to ensure players are adequately informed on how to play-no small task considering the importance of tactics and formations in a game that takes place in a truly three-dimensional world. The overall goal is to make the learning curve more of an integral part of the game Homeworld than just a straight tutorial. GENRE: Real-Time Strategy Graphically, the game is just getting better and better, RELEASE DATE: Q2 '99 supporting eye-popping resolutions up to 1600x1200 for DEVELOPER: Relic Entertainment owners of TNT cards. Look for the HOMEWORLD demo in an PUBLISHER: Sierra Studios upcoming issue of CGW.Robert Coffey Supply and Demand CONQUEST adds a layer of strategy not seen in other strategy games with its use of supplies. Don't confuse supplies with resources-think of supplies as a ship's store of ammo. Once a ship's supplies are depleted, the ship functions much less effectively until it receives fresh supplies. While you'll be able to shuttle supplies directly to specific ships, a tanker kept in a battle group will restock the ships in that groupat least until the enemy blows it up. It's Digital Anvil's hope that the supply system will counteract rushing and force players to do some actual strategizing. This type of decision-making is indicative of CONQUEST's focus on alleviating some of the more annoying aspects of many RTS games. Ships placed in formations will stay in those formations and move at the speed of the slowest fleet member—no more unit groups dribbling single-file across a map. In order to encourage gamers to actually fight, survivors of battles will be rewarded with the salvageable supplies of their conquered adversaries. You'll be able to share resources with allies in multiplayer games, and all multiplayer games will take place on randomly created maps to minimize the advantages that come from map memorization CONQUEST boasts an ambitious game design, so it should be no surprise that it looks great, too.

"Sci-Fi Sneak Spectacular Starlancer Terran Units MIDAS BATTLESHIP Heavy Assault Warship While slow in combat with engines that tend, to overheat, the Midas has an upgraded propulsion system and two high-powered laser cannons, which make it a key component in any assault. Its two mounted laser blast cannons and powerful tempest charge provide a heavy attack with medium defense. The Creators of WWII-style Space Sims Return to Their Roots SNEAK PREVIEWS In Space, No One Can Hear You... Associate Producer Eric Peterson says of STARLANCER, \"One of the things we (the designers) are focusing on is the detail. We noticed that in other space sims, the little things tend to be cut out, and that tends to make these games a bit empty. For us, the details help make the game more compelling.\" To show this attitude in INDICATOR FLEET CARRIER Mobile Fighter Attack Squad With two squads of heavy attack fighter wings and a design that provides power and control, the Indicator can execute long-range strikes, the keystone of any Terran attack. The Indicator's sluggish movement and light shielding, however, leave it vulnerable to close-range attacks. by Thierry Nguyen t has been said that Chris Roberts created the WING COMMANDER (WC) games as a response to being turned down for a Star Wars game. Regardless, he did a fine job with the WC series, making four solid games before moving on to create his own company, Digital Anvil.STARLANCER a part of the opening lineup from Digital Anvil, is another space sim that refines the solid design that Roberts laid out for space sims way back in WING COMMANDER. hernet TON CANNON CHS LADANON Cat C lurus ACHILLEAN DREADNOUGHT Flagship Battle Cruiser By far the biggest of the Terran attack ships, the Dreadnought has four heavy shock cannons, making it unequaled in close combat.

With most of the game in place, the CONQUEST development team has set aside the next several months for play balancing and designing the missions and sub-missions that make up the campaign games. If those factors live up to the high ideal that Digital Anvil has set, CONQUEST: FRONTIER WARS should be a real-time standout when it's released late this year. CGW Which World War Is This?

Rather than go with the traditional players will band together and go through an branching campaign, the development team is entire campaign. (Continued on page 60) in World War II, each country made fighters with distinctive styles. The Japanese craft tended to be lightly armored and maneuverable, while the Germans created fighters that could take a pounding. This design philosophy extends to outer space as well, as we look at three fighters (one German, two American) from STARLANCER. There are also several types of cannons and missiles, each with distinct characteristics, so you're encouraged to create a balanced loadout when configuring your ships. Grendal: This is a German two-person medium fighter. This is a textbook example of firepower, as it brandishes two heavy cannons, four additional energy weapons, and eight missile hardpoints. The copilot has access to a gunnery pod, and the ship has reverse thrusters that allow it to brake almost instantaneously. Of course, with all of its guns and armor, it has a hard time turning. Tachyon Novalogic Focuses on Exploration and Freedom Patriot: This is an American twoperson, long-range fighter. It's quite fast and agile, and has heavy shielding with strong armor. It features two customizable cannon mounts and two Tachyon Cannons (extremely powerful, but short-range), and it uses both Blind Fire (where guns automatically track their target with in a certain arc) and Lasso (a tractor beam that holds targets stationary). ooking for a space combat game in which you're not locked into an immutable series of scripted missions? Searching for something offering a little more control over which path your space gamLing experience travels down? Novalogic's TACHYON may be just what you've been waiting for. TACHYON will let gamers choose to play on one of two sides: either the ragtag Bora or the enormous GalSpan Corporation. While each side has a core campaign of 15 to 20 missions, gamers won't be forced to tackle them one after the other. Instead, we'll see lots of variation in the form of tons of miniquests. These will provide not only expanded gameplay but also the opportunity to upgrade your starship and uncover some plot subtleties as well. Not just one-off affairs, the miniquests will frequently string several missions together as a smaller substory unfolds. Both the miniand main quests will be assigned at various space stations, where new reports will provide pertinent information. Early in its development, TACHYON's combat doesn't look all that different except in the way debris is handled: Chunks of destroyed enemies can collide with and damage your vessel, as can fragments of exploded asteroids. The design team from Novalogic is really shooting for an open, expansive feel, a sense of freedom they believe is lacking in other sims. To that end, gamers will have to open and explore vast new regions of space, transporting themselves through jump-gates scattered across the game universe. An enormous sense of scale adds to the overwhelming size of the gameworld, with behemoth battleships and space Tachyon stations the size of Luxembourg. Add to that an ambitious GENRE: Space Sim goal of hosting up to 100 players online, and TACHYON RELEASE DATE: Q4 '99 may be the biggest space sim on the block when it's DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER: Novalogic released late this year. -Robert Coffey Phoenix: This is an American twoperson, experimental fighter. Extremely fast and light while still carrying heavy shielding for defense; on offense it has four cannon mounts and several missile hardpoints. It possesses \"leap\" technology that lets it cover short distances at incredible speed, and it has upgraded Blind Fire and Lasso components. 58 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"Sci-Fi Sneak Spectacular SUSANO VOADOLES 22 LEEN Starfleet Command Tactical Starship Combat in Realtime SNEAK PREVIEWS ANTILOCK BRAKES NOT INCLUDED Depending on your clearance, your choices for which ship to configure for the mission come from a pool of 20. by Denny Atkin TARFLEET COMMAND may just be the Wrath of Khan to STARFLEET ACADEMY'S Star Trek V. A meld of strategy, simulation, and the best elements of paper-based games, STARFLEET COMMAND realizes the promise of a tactical starship combat game. Far from the WING COMMANDER feel of the earlier title, STARFLEET COMMAND feels as if you're controlling a huge, heavily armed starship. Billed as a strategy game, it feels in many ways like a third-person starship simulation. TORPEDOES AWAY! Mission victory isn't always through destruction; you may have to disable a ship, or safely escort a diplomatic contingent. Moving On Up Before getting into combat, moving about on the ship is a bit like movement in 7TH GUEST; that is, you go from room to room via prerendered moving sequences. Your personal chamber is complete with a fish tank (you can even feed the fish-a cute little \"for fun\" detail), but the most important feature in your room is the information database, which tells you everything you need to know about guns, ships, and the current battle situation. You can then go to the bar and chat it up with fellow pilots, or get to the briefing room. If you're of high-enough rank, this is where you will decide how the squads are deployed; otherwise you go straight to outfitting your ship. There are 12 basic fighters and a host of miscellaneous craft (like harvesters or mine-layers) to fly; the ships are divided into classes such as gold and silver, with the gamer starting with only bronze-level clearance and the best ships being at platinum level. The game puts aside traditional FMV, going for prerendered cinemas and 3D-rendered characters. If you thought the space-battle scenes in the WING COMMANDER movie looked slick, well, the same effects team that did those is doing the cut-scenes for STARLANCER. As for the real space battles, they'll be taking full advantage of Direct3D on your rig. One very nice effect we saw was when two ships rammed each other; both shields lit up and created a very nice light show. We tested this build on a low-end system (a Pentium-Pro 200 with a Voodoo), and it still ran smoothly. The developers aren't neglecting the 3D-accelerator holdouts; there will be a software-rendering option. All in all, STARLANCER will retain the old-fashion gameplay of the WING COMMANDER games, but will add enough tweaks and refinements to make the new game compelling. CGW Shields Up STARFLEET COMMAND isn't your typical \"build many vehicles and hoard the resources\" strategy game. Rather, you're put in command of a single starship, one simulated in far more detail than the typical RTS vehicle. As you explore strange new worlds, you'll oversee your ship's systems, targeting individual weapons, launching probes, handling damage control, and managing your ship's energy levels. During some missions you'll be able to give tactical orders to other ships or swap control to another starship. The game's designers drew their starship and weapons technical data from the Starfleet Battles paper-based game. This gives STARFLEET COMMAND the foundation of a game system that has more than a decade of play balancing. But the command and control system was designed from the ground up for the computer game. So you won't see any of the odd conversion artifacts here that make you feel as if you're playing a paper game on a computer. The meat of the game is the campaign mode. Here you'll find a story arc by JUDGMENT RITES scripter Scott Bennie, with missions that advance the game's storyline. There's also a mission generator that takes the makeup of your fleet, looks at the tactical situation, and creates a mission from a pool of seed missions, modifying the makeup of the enemy fleet to provide an appropriate level of challenge. We're most looking forward to multiplayer. Each player can command a race, or players can team up. You'll be able to play from the perspective of at least five sides: the Federation, Romulans, Klingons, and two races brought over from Starfleet Battles the Lyrans and the Hydrans. If the development team has time, they'll add the Gorn as a playable race; they'll at least be in there along with Orion Pirates as computer-controlled ships. The developers also hope to add cooperative multiplayer missions. Your Five-Year Missions STARFLEET COMMAND will include skirmish, campaign, and multiplayer missions. The skirmishes are pure starship combat-select your fleet, choose your enemies, and slug it out. The only goal here Starfleet Command is complete destruction of GENRE: Strategy the bad RELEASE DATE: 03 '99 guys-Prime DEVELOPER: Quicksilver Directive be PUBLISHER: Interplay damned. Beam Aboard The alpha version we've been playing has dazzling 3D-accelerated special effects and explosions. Tactics play a big part-you can hide in nebulae or use cloaking devices to lose enemies. Our big concern, though, is long-term playability. However, if the missions are varied and the engine lends itself to enough creative strategies (our favorite was using a tractor beam to slam a Federation ship into an asteroid), it could be a trek worth taking. CGW Thierry Nguyen is torn between naming TIE FIGHTER or WING COMMANDER II his \"favorite game ever\" (much to the chagrin of his CIVILIZATION-loving coworkers). Denny Atkin learned to talk in the mid-'60s by watching Star Trek and Batman, and can probably blame that for his being nearly as big a geek as Jeff Green. 60 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"System Shock 2 The Underrated Original Gets What Looks to Be a Worthy Sequel SNEAK PREVIEWS by Thierry Nguyen 994 was the year that Looking Glass went digital. After quietly defining the first-person RPG with its ULTIMA UNDERWORLD games, the Looking Glass team, influenced by William Gibson's groundbreaking cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, produced SYSTEM SHOCK. Hailed as a classic melding of action and adventure by gamers and critics alike, the game somehow got lost in the big action flood and was regarded largely as a cult hit. Well, it's five years later, and Irrational Games (a development house composed of ex-Looking Glass employees) has partnered up with Looking Glass to answer fans' desire for a true sequel, named, aptly enough, SYSTEM SHOCK 2. and skills at said stations. One station modifies base stats, while another will modify all technical skills, all weapon skills, or all psionic skills. SHOCK 2 is a skillsbased system, and it has a wide variety, ranging from weapon proficiencies to repairing and research. One criticism of SYSTEM SHOCK was that it didn't really have a feel for character development. Irrational Games, inspired by FALLOUT's skills-based system, hopes that players will feel closer to their characters in SHOCK 2. Plugging the Port \"The main problem with the original game was its interface; when you began the game, we literally threw a screen full of text at you on how to use the interface. one of our main goals was to make the interface more intuitive and easier to learn for the newbies,\" says Ken Levine, the lead desinger for SHOCK 2.

"Buddhist or Christian? ou start out as a Buddhist Daimyo. But you can show that you are receptive to Christianity by building a trading post around 1542, along with a few Jesuit churches, and the Portuguese will gladly begin selling you firearms. This certainly gives you an advantage over Buddhist lords with archers. Once you build a certain number of Jesuit churches on your territories you will qualify as important enough to build a Cathedral. Then you'll receive one of the most powerful units in the game, the Father Visitor. He is the Pope's emissary and a valuable political tool: You can use him to order other Christian Daimyo to ally with you instead of battling them. Should you instead continue down the Buddhist route, you don't get firearms as early as the Christians, but you do retain the use of ferocious Warrior Monks. Eventually (19 years later), the Dutch arrive and sell guns to anyone that can pay, so military balance is restored if it's not too late. Although the Christian Father Visitor is a powerful unit, the Buddhists have their own equivalent, known as the Legendary Geisha, who is an unstoppable spy. SNEAK PREVIEWS = = = EEEEE = alongside fresh recruits. Experienced soldiers become unit leaders, and having them in a unit will increase that unit's overall effectiveness. To further complicate matters, plans are afoot to use ninjas and spies in the realtime scenarios to assassinate generals in the field (thus demoralizing the whole army) or infiltrate an enemy's army and turn a particular unit against its master by having a spy as its leader. SILENT FOOTSTEPS OF DEATH If you remain Buddhist, you get ninja instead of guns-a fair trade-off. or semicircular one that allows you to protect flanks or encircle a smaller enemy completely. Each unit of your army will also be represented by a icon at the bottom of the screen, giving you immediate access without having to scroll all over the battlefield. These icons contain information such as the amount of troops in the unit, what they're doing (marching, charging, fighting...), and what their morale is like. The latter is very important since demoralized soldiers will retreat en masse, leaving you up the creek without a sword, as it were. Reasons for low morale range from you simply losing a battle to sending troops unprotected on an impossible mission. However, this isn't the 20th century, so if you lose a battle or your men desert you, you will probably have to regain honor at the palace by ordering your general to perform seppuku (ritual suicide). In extreme situations you might have to perform seppuku yourself, handing over the reins of power to one of your sons. As each individual soldier within a unit actually fights his own battles, each soldier gains experience points. Your army does not disappear after each battle; instead its remnants return to your castles and form part of the next army Sun Tzu Says... The Al is very advanced and SHOGUN has one of the best routing mechanisms I've seen in a RTS game. Because soldiers are banded together into units of 60 or more and do everything together within this unit, you will eventually be able to have over a thousand troops moving about with a sense of order. Ask them to go across a bridge, and they will queue up to do so in a scene reminiscent of the Tokyo underground, rather than bugger off in the wrong direction trying to find another way over like most RTS games. In terms of its battle tactics it also acts realistically, using the basic principles of Sun Tzu's The Art of War. It's surprising that the Samurai era hasn't been more extensively covered by the games community, but SHOGUN: TOTAL WAR should serve to draw attention to it again. Despite the beauty of its graphics, this is not a lightweight game; it looks likely to tax the gray matter as well as tantalize the eyeballs, If The Creative Edge squeezes in all of the features it intends, on top of what we have already seen, they could easily win some battles with this game. CGW Alan Dykes is the managing editor of PC Gaming World, CGW's counterpart across the pond in England. Strategy and Religion he two elements to SHOGUN involve overall strategy and battlefield tactics, the former being played in turn-based RISK-style, the latter in a gorgeously rendered real-time environment. The strategy element has two main playing screens. The first, the throne room, is your inner sanctuary and contains up to five characters, all seated around a map table. The characters represent your Military, Political and Economic advisors, a Scribe (your save-game mechanism), and a variety of Emissaries who represent your dealings with the other Daimyo. As your empire progresses, you'll have to leave more and more general administration up to the advisors as the amount of territories you control increases. Rather than just being statistical icons, these advisors will apparently have a personality-some aggressive, some passive and wise-and they will all dispense anecdotes and whine about how little budget they have. Clicking on the table accesses the second strategy screen, a close-up version of the map of Japan, realistically textured like a silk print. Your territories include an upgradable castle/keep, and there will be around 16 additional buildings, such as a Horse Dojo, and specialist buildings like the Ninja House, or the Tranquil Garden (where spies are trained). wiwaPTENTRICAIN COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1999 "

However, comparisons to MYTH will abound, due to BRAVEHEART's three-quarters viewpoint, rotating cameras, and vivid 3D models. Those who choose only to jump straight into the real-time tactical combat will miss out on what looks to be a very rich, complex, and intriguing gameworld. In addition to forming and fielding armies, you will need to control a number of villages, much as you would in CIVILIZATION II or LORDS OF THE REALM II. It will be essential to balance units of production, handle diplomacy with your neighbors, and manage your armies and their leaders if you want to win this game.

If not, here's a crash course, In the 13th century, the king of Scotland died without a son to take his place on the throne. The English (who w were nothing if not opportunists) claimed the Scottish throne as theirs and invaded the Scottish lowlands to seal that claim. Some Scottish nobles (the heads of Scottish clans) fought the English while some licked the English boots; the bootlickers won. \"However, all was not well in Scotland. The English king, Edward the Longshanks, ruted Scotland more with an iron fist than a velvet glove, which annoyed many of the Scottish nobles. They, in turn, fought against the king, which, as you might imagine, served only to annoy him. Of course, in the way these things usually play themselves out, the most annoyed were the comon folk, who got spears, swords, and arrows applied to various body parts on a regular basis. William Wallace (Mel Gibson's character in the movie) was among those who fought the English, and you can enlist his services in the game, if you so choose.

"Flight Unlimited III SNEAK PREVIEWS Might Skies and story Weather Over Seattle by Denny Atkin creaming toward the target at 450 knots, the pilot scanned for unknown aircraft. This was new territory, and he didn't want any surprises-things were about to get tense enough. The weather was rough, but he was flying one of the hottest jets around. It was time to make his ingress. He scanned his panel one more time and made the fateful call. \"Tower, this is SeaTac. This is helped by the sim's support for 1024x768 resolution, complete with instrument panels. Of course, one of the biggest complaints about FLIGHT II was that you had a very limited area in which to fly. FLIGHT III again models only a single geographical area-Seattle/ Tacoma-with approximately 10,000 square miles of satellite terrain data. However, if you own FLIGHT II, you'll be able to fly all the way from Seattle to the San Francisco Bay Area. There are some compromises to pull this off without requiring a DVD to hold all the texture maps. The older terrain will still be at FLIGHT Il levels of detail, and the area between the two cities will have accurate terrain elevations and navigational aids but only generic landscape textures. used to be the smallest distinguishable structures, but now you can see individual homes and things don't begin to blur out until you reach a very low altitude. In addition, there's more detail in the polygon mesh that the terrain is mapped on, so hills have a more curvy look to them. Buildings are sharper, with more polygons and better texturing than in the earlier title. (And yes, Linux fans, Bill Gates' mansion will be there for your kamikaze enjoyment.) Ground objects, such as ships, will now move throughout the world.

Sometimes it seemed even carrier landings weren't as harrowing as trying to enter the busy landing pattern on a stormy Seattle evening. FLIGHT UNLIMITED III aims to bring some of the excitement found in military simulations to the civilian arena, while at the same time bringing the series even closer to reality than ever before.

"I wenty years ago, George Lucas released Star Wars with very little fanfare. Today, the new Star Wars film looks to be the biggest media event of the decade. The release this spring of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, one of the most anticipated movies of all time, is being heralded by a true multimedia blitz that includes magazines, books, action figures, and of course, computer games. LucasArts, under the auspices of LucasFilms, held a media event to give us a sneak peek at the two upcoming Episode I games that will coincide with the movie s release. These games will try to capture the very essence of the movie and distill it into digital form for Star Wars fans and gamers. The first, RACER, takes a visceral and blisteringly fast 15 minutes of the film and extrapolates it into a full gaming experience. The second, STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, attempts something far more grand: to create an interactive version of the movie. Each game takes a different approach to the same goal: capturing the magic of Star Wars Episode I and bringing it home to the gamer. The Phantom Menace is as close to a sure thing as you can get, but what about the games? We'll tell you if the Force is with them as well.

"Episode I: THE PHANTOM MENACE LucasArts and Big Ape Productions Bring the Movie to Your Desktop Genre: Adventure. Release Date: Q2 '99. Developer/Publisher: LucasArts. www.lucasarts.com by Elliott Chin f you've ever watched a movie and wanted to yell at the protagonist to do something differently, here's your chance. STAR WARS EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE is essentially a digital version of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the movie. Big Ape Productions, the developers of THE PHANTOM MENACE, read the screenplay and started work on the game just as LucasFilms began shooting. When a scene was added to the movie, Big Ape went back and added it to the game. Big Ape hopes to re-create the movie, putting you in the roles of up to four major characters and allowing you to relive \"the adventure.\" That's not to say that you won't need to play the game because you've already seen the movie. The game will mirror the movie, but it will flesh out all the worlds and events in between the scenes on the big screen. For instance, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn spend five minutes escaping from the Trade Federation's spaceship in the film; the game will allow you to spend hours there, visiting every nook and cranny and battling both the enemies Obi-Wan faces onscreen and those he doesn't. And while Obi-Wan might spend only a few scenes in the port of Mos Espa, you'll be able to guide him throughout the entire city, exploring its many side streets and talking to dozens of characters.

"STAR WARS EPISODE I GAMES COVER STORY THE PHANTOM MENACE (continued) are based on scenes that LucasFilms cut out of The Phantom Menace. Gamers should not expect to see a traditional LucasArts adventure game in the GRIM FANDANGO or CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND vein. Gameplay in THE PHANTOM MENACE is more of a cross between a third-person lightsaber/shooter action game and a platform game, with lots of dialogue and a mix of characters thrown in to advance the storyline. Faraway Tales The plot, of course, follows that of the movie (for details, see the \"The Story Begins\" sidebar). The unfair taxation of trade routes is precipitating a huge civil war in the Galactic Republic. The Jedi Knights have been dispatched to investigate matters. The two sent-Obi-Wan Kenobi and his mentor, QuiGon Jinn go on an interplanetary mission, visiting queens senators, Hutts, and others as they try to keep the peace.  BACK RACER (continued) strapped to a pair of enormous (20-to 34-foot) engines. Leash yourself behind a couple of rocketsleds and you'll start to get the idea. Forever flirting with breaking the sound barrier, podracers whip through tracks 20—30 miles long in less than two minutes. It's a sport that requires confidence, consummate control, and fearlessness-neck braces are optional. Since the game's design team includes veterans of SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE, X-WING, and JEDI KNIGHT, Star Wars aficionados can be assured that the license won't be mishandled. Actually, the biggest hurdle facing the designers is having to accurately depict the complicated physics of the three-piece vehicles. Tenuously tethered to the powerful engines, the pod will be whipped around .corners during turns and will swing up and down wildly through stomach-churning drops and daring jumps. It's OIL CHANGE Anakin Skywalker waits for his podracer to be prepared for the next race.   94 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. MAY 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"COVER STORY For about half the game, you play Obi-Wan Kenobi, although Qui-Gon will be by your side for much of the time. Later, you will be able to switch characters and become Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Padme of the planet Naboo, or her bodyguard Panaka. You'll generally control only one character at a time, and whom you play will be dictated by the storyline. Big Ape claims the experience will be different, depending on which character you control. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon for instance, wield lightsabers and the Force as their primary weapons; Queen Padme commands a retinue of bodyguards, and the queen's chief bodyguard, Panaka, with no Force or minions to command, will have wide access to more conventional weapons. For most of the game, you'll control only one character, but in the last few levels, as the game draws to a climax, you'll actually jump between control of two characters. We assume it will be Obi-Wan and the Queen. So you may quide Queen Padme for a few minutes, and then jump to ObiWan as he approaches a lightsaber duel. Then you might cut back to Queen Padme as she faces imminent danger.

Struggles of the Force No matter which character you play, however, the basic structure of gameplay remains the same. You explore the environment, encounter a hostile situation, a puzzle, or a character, and then deal with it. In most cases, you'll resort to violence PUT THAT SABER AWAY The 3D environments and characters are light-years ahead of those in JEDI KNIGHT. 10 an entirely new racing dynamic that seems certain to challenge even experienced gamers-especially if they opt for the added complexity of controlling each engine with its own joystick. 234.64 TSJE POS Track of Your Tears When it came to designing the various tracks, the development team focused on taking gamers out of the standard, tunnel-vision, painted-line mentality that seems to rule most racing titles. This is easier said than done, since you still want gamers to know which way to go. Plus the mammoth size of the podracers prohibited the extensive use of restricted spaces. In the end, RACER wound up with an organic, natural-looking environment that uses visual cues to nudge gamers in the right direction. Taking place across seven worlds, with at least three tracks per world, RACER should offer a variety of daunting courses. The first race will take place on Tatooine, and should mirror the actual sequence from the movie, with the added attraction of a few surprises. Other tracks include an ice planet course that speeds across ROCKET RACER Piloting a three-piece, sound barrier-busting chariot is hard enough.

"STAR WARS EPISODE 1 GAMES SERVANTS OF THE FORCE OF THE COVER_STORY HOME PORT This is the port of Mos Espa, home to the soon-tobe-famous Anakin Skywalker. THE PHANTOM MENACE (continued) Obi-Wan Kenobi: Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is a much younger version of the man we all know from the original Star Wars—and more of a rogue. A fully developed Jedi, Obi-Wan starts the game with his lightsaber and a small arsenal of Force powers. With his lightsaber, you can block a barrage of frontal laser fire, although you'll still get caught by side or rear fire. Big Ape says that lightsaber attacks won't be as complicated as in fighting games. There will be various attack types, like quick jabs, jump attacks, and sweeping slashes, but you'll execute them with no more than the attack, move, and jump buttons. As a Jedi, Obi-Wan will sometimes have the option to \"persuade\" characters to say things they might not otherwise agree to. You'll control Obi-Wan for the first half of the game, and during the final levels. to deal with the hostile threat, which could be a number of enemies or some sort of deadly trap. The game opens, in fact, with you being lulled into a gas trap. With a proto col droid distracting you, you have to figure out what that strange mist rolling into your waiting room is. The droid says that it's just steam from a leak in the pipes, but your Jedi senses might tell you otherwise. As for the puzzles, most of them are simply errands and inventory swaps. You might need help from a certain character, but he won't talk to you until after you've helped him fix his vehicle. So you first have to go get a spare part from a shop owner, but before he gives it to you, you have to help him with a favor. Most of puzzles thoughout THE PHANTOM MENACE involve some variation of this theme: Give an item to get an item or barter a service for a favor. Qui-Gon Jinn: Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) is a wiser Jedi than Obi-Wan, but in the movie, there is little discernable difference in their powers. Thus, in the game, they are pretty much identical, although their lightsaber attacks will look different. You'll control QuiGon for two or three levels. GIVE PEACE A CHANCE In one of the early sequences, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon must go aboard this Federation ship to negotiate peace between the Trade Federation and Naboo. 96 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"COVER STORY ROCKET RACE This shot is taken from the podracing sequence in The Phantom Menace. LucasArts is betting that this sequence will be so exciting that audiences will want to relive it in RACER. RACER (continued) Besides the traps, action, and inventory puzzles, there are nearly 70 characters for you to meet there are dozens in Mos Espa alone. Some of these characters are just there to add ambience and will greet you with a \"hello\" or with indifference. Others might even try to pick fights with you. Some characters are there to offer you side quests. Most of the time, they'll ask for a favor. For instance, an alien in Mos Espa asks you to find her son. In return, she'll give you valuable items that you might not otherwise acquire. These side quests are entirely optional, but they can really influence the gameplay. In one of the early levels, you'll make your first trip to Theed, where you will encounter a jailed Naboo citizen who asks you to free him. If you ignore him, he'll still be in jail when you return to Theed. But if you do help him, the next time you glaciers and through twisting ice tunnels (LucasArts won't confirm, but it sounds a lot like Hoth to me); a track set high in the clouds on an abandoned gas mine with large chunks of missing track making for some harrowing jumps (can you say...Bespin?); and a track that takes racers through a mountain village and across a swamp, until they pass through the heart of a volcano. One particularly interesting track is set upon an asteroid used as a prison: Your podracer will leave the ground to whip around the walls and ceilings as you pass through zero-G tubes. To make things even more dangerous, most tracks will feature a variety of hazards, including lava tunnels, burning methane lakes, falling meteors, cyclones, and sniping Tusken raiders. The maneuverability of the podracers will allow gamers to tilt vertically to pass through narrow canyons and avoid other physical obstacles.

Queen Padme: Queen Padme (Natalie Portman) is the queen of Naboo and a pivotal figure in the game. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon must protect her and then escort her to the capital world of Coruscant, where she will petition the Galactic Senate for aid for her people. When you control her, it will be for the last few levels of the game. She is physically weaker than the Jedi and Panaka, but she commands up to four bodyguards who follow her throughout a level. When a hostile situation presents itself, you'll be able to issue a variety of commands to your lackeys. They'll scout for you, fight for you, cover you while you perform some action, or run interference for you. Captain Panaka: Panaka (Hugh Quarshie) is Queen Padme's chief bodyguard, and you control him for only a brief level or two. He has neither the Jedi's Force nor Queen Padme's entourage, but he will probably have access to the largest conventional arsenal in the game, including laser guns and other futuristic weapons. are in Theed, he'll repay the favor with information and perhaps some weapons you wouldn't otherwise get. Aside from providing flavor and side quests, characters also help advance the plot. There are more than 4,000 lines of dialogue, but you might not hear all of them, depending on your decisions in the game. If you insult characters or betray their trust you might close avenues of communication and cut yourself off from side quests. Among the many characters you'll meet in the game are Anakin Skywalker, Shmi Skywalker (Anakin's mother), Jar Jar Binks (the prequel's version of Chewbacca), and Darth Sidious (the main villain). Most of the movie's actors will reprise their voice roles for the game, although Natalie Portman (Queen Padme), Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan), and Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon) most probably will not. RACER (continued) will deliver the requisite eye candy, special care is being paid to the crash animations. Expect to see colliding racers, flameouts, and more. Just hope you won't be the unlucky charioteer spinning wildly in your pod, bounced through a ravine by a single wrecked engine before exploding in a big, fat fireball. Fortunately, you'll have some ways to avoid such mishaps. For one thing, each track will feature multiple paths and shortcuts. Plus, every podracer is self-repairing provided that you don't utterly trash the thing but the self-repair process slows you down. That's all well and good, but probably the best approach will come in using your winnings to purchase racer upgrades courtesy of Watto, a slightly shady character who sells podracer parts. If you don't have any money, don't give up: you can salvage spare parts from the junkyard. Unfortunately, salvaged parts are much less reliable and are apt to blow out under the stress of a full-blown race. With seven categories of system performance to tweak, and six parts available for each system, players will have plenty of decisions to mull over when it comes to customizing their podracers. Do you boost your repulsorlift at the expense of acceleration? Do you upgrade your vehicle's self-repair ability two levels, or just opt for better turning ability and a higher top speed? Gamers will undoubtedly upgrade their cooling systems the first chance they get. That's because racers can turboboost their engines, charging them up slowly before blasting away past the competition. But there's a danger: Too much boosting will burn out your engines and help you clinch that prestigious last-place finish. Upgraded cooling systems will let RUNNING HOT AND COLD This concept art shows two of the different worlds on which you'll race: One is a wide-open desert planet with towering rock spires; the other, an ice planet honeycombed with frigid tunnels. 98 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

I will give you 5000 Credits for a T-14 I will give you a Portable Fusion Coil from Naboo in exchange for the T-14. Never mind. GREETINGS By speaking to many NPCs you'll get various quests and information. Chariots of (Rocket-Fueled) Fire There will more than 20 vehicles in the game, though only six will be available at the start of the game. New podracers are unlocked after you beat the boss racers of various tracks. As more podracers and bosses are made available, you'll be able to pick and choose the vehicle or character that best suits the particular race. Expect lots of variety in vehicle types, from nimble smaller craft to gargantuan engines that are long on speed and power but woefully short on turning ability. Unlocking those additional podracers won't be easy. since there's a reason why most of these bosses are IT TAKES ALL KINDS Star Wars: The Experience The most striking things about THE PHANTOM MENACE were the ambience and sense of immersion in the game. While the action and puzzles didn't seem extraordinary, the level of detail and immersion were impressive. In the swamp level on Naboo, there are flocks of alien birds flying overhead, strange alien creatures grazing in the marsh, and battle droids on STAPs zooming by on patrol runs. On the capital world of Coruscant, lines of traffic streak across the sky and space ships come and go in what obviously depicts a busy megametropolis. In Mos Espa, vendors stand near doorways, kids play on the street, and bystanders add a bustling aura to the city. You'll be able to kill characters if the mood strikes you. But if you do that, expect a change in citizens' attitudes toward you. In the demo we saw, when Obi-Wan killed an innocent person, the kids playing in the street cried out, \"Who ya gonna murder next, mister?\" Big Ape says the game's ambient characters will react odracers come in all shapes and 1 sizes. The first racer is young Anakin Skywalker's and will be among the very few available at the start of the game. The second podracer will be unlocked during the course of the game and is notable since it is the only vehicle that lacks an unobstructed view of the track the solid front of the circular pod effectively blinds the pilot. Fortunately, this podracer is equipped with a unique scanning device that will display a virtual view of the track ahead. The last podracer is that of Sebulba, the last boss to beat in the game and Anakin's chief racing rival in the movie. Beat Sebulba and you can then play as him in multiplayer matches, thus alerting opponents that you're good enough to beat the game. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1999 "

"STAR WARS EPISODE I GAMES THE PHANTOM MENACE (continued) OVER STORY WHERE'S THE QUEEN? On your way to the Queen's Palace on Theed, the story will pick up. What is the connection between the Dark Lords of the Sith and the Queen's enemies at the Trade Federation? RACER (continued) champions. In a word: cheating. Rival racers will run you into walls, drop mines to blow your vehicle off course, and freeze or overheat your engines. The most dastardly opponents will disrupt the magnetic beam that links your engines together and prevents them from shooting off in different directions. Once that magnetic bond is broken, you'll be lucky to keep yourself from being ripped in two, let alone have a chance of competing. Should you survive long enough, you'll eventually face Sebulba, the top-ranked champion and a character from the movie. Beat Sebulba and you can then play as him-perhaps granting you a psychological edge in multiplayer games. Even if you can't play as Sebulba, you will be able to save and use custom-configured podracers in multiplayer games. RACER should support up to eight competitors over a LAN or the Internet. While LucasArts fully intends for some online entity to serve as a host for RACER games, a concrete deal had not been struck at press time. Still, finding someone to host games should be pretty much of a slam-dunk, I mean, really think about it—this is Star Wars for Pete's sake. It's not like an online host would really be taking a chance on whether there's an audience for this game. RACER should be hitting shelves right about the time the prequel lights up movie screens. With its unique take on the racing genre and the tidal wave of hype and publicity accompanying the film, RACER looks well positioned to enjoy a very nice summer. CGW to violence in different ways. Some might run from you in fear, others might goad you to more violence, and some might call for help. Armed guards will also come to apprehend you. You could fight them off, but the body count would only escalate. Unfortunately, Big Ape said it won't add any provision for turning to the Dark Side (it's not in the script), but senseless violence will definitely make your life more difficult: Certain characters will refuse to talk to you, making it harder for you to accomplish your goals. Level Playing Field The game will have 11 levels, set on 6 different worlds (not counting secret areas). The environments we saw in the game included the hallways of the Federation spaceship (reminiscent of the halls of Cloud City); an underwater domed city, the palace of Queen Padme; the swamps of Naboo; skyscrapers on Coruscant that seemed to float in the clouds, and the desert markets of the port city of Mos Espa on Tatooine. All have their own distinct look, ambient characters and sounds, and enemies, which include new droids and alien thugs. Robert Coffey is currently standing in line to see Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. He should actually enter the theater sometime early this September. Please don't tip off the plot as you pass him on your way out. The Story Begins (Warning: Huge Spoiler!) Te've managed to piece together the plot of the movie-and the game—from a variety of sources. If you still want to be surprised when the movie premieres in theaters in May, stop reading now. Not all of these details are confirmed, but to the best of our knowledge this is the official story. The game begins as the movie does, with Obiwan and Qui-Gon meeting with Trade Federation officials aboard a spaceship orbiting the planet Naboo, asking them to lift a blockade they've erected around Naboo. However, the Federation has no intention of negotiating in good faith, and reveals its alliance with the Sith Lords—the same order that later calls Darth Vader master, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon manage to escape from the Federation ship and make their way to Theed, the capital of Naboo. There they meet Queen Padme and offer to escort her to Coruscant, where she will petition the Galactic Senate for aid. Details are sketchy, but it appears that the party leaves Naboo for Coruscant, stopping along the way and meeting Anakin Skywalker, who joins them. Events escalate, and Naboo comes under direct attack by the forces of the Trade Federation and Darth Sidious, the movie's main villain. Anakin, Obi-Wan, and the rest of the Jedi rally to Queen Padme's defense. That's all we know at this point.

The cut-scene for the end of Level One, for example, shows Obi-Wan escaping the Federation's grasp and landing in a swamp, separated from Qui-Gon, and being hunted by Nimoudian troops. The second level opens with ObiWan knee-deep in swamp water. Armed with the knowledge provided in the cut-scene, you are charged with exploring the swamp, looking for the city of Theed and for any signs of Qui-Gon. STAR WARS EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE is scheduled to release simultaneously with the film. Right now Big Ape is polishing play balance, differentiating the four characters, touching up graphics, and adding music and voices. THE PHANTOM MENACE doesn't lend itself to multiplay, so it will be a single-player game only. However, it's Star Wars, so it probably won't need multiplay to attract immediate attention. The trick will be keeping gamers' attention once they do pick up the game. We're concerned about some aspects of the game, such as how Big Ape plans to balance the four characters so that each is compelling, and whether it can reach out to newbies while still incorporating enough gameplay to satisfy core gamers. Still, THE PHANTOM MENACE re-creates the entire movie on your computer, a movie many fans have been waiting 20 years to see. While it's not likely to break technological or gameplay barriers, its ability to explore new aspects of such a popular universe virtually guarantees the game's success. CGW Elliott Chin's subconscious has replayed the Star Wars Episode I trailer more often than the Marin County Bijou Theater. n addition to the two Star Wars Episode I games featured in this feature, three more unannounced titles should ship by year's end. But what about FORCE COMMANDER, the real-time strategy Star Wars game unveiled at 1998's E3 show? Since that time, LucasArts has put the wraps on any publicity and pushed back the FORCE COMMANDER release date. Rumors circulated that it was being rescripted and folded into the Episode I lineup, or that it was now dead. Neither rumor is true, according to LucasArts. Indeed, it is still in development, but probably won't be out until the end of this year at best. It will take place in the classic Star Wars time frame, and appears to be the last such Star Wars game for the immediate future. The last time we saw it, FORCE COMMANDER was a land-based real-time strategy game featuring nearly a hundred Star Wars vehicles, including speeder bikes, AT-ATs, and stormtroopers. A mission-based tactical game in the same vein as COMMAND & CONQUER, it uses a new 3D engine with a top-down perspective. Its two campaigns (one Rebel and one Imperial), were slated to take place throughout the original Star Wars trilogy timeline and jump from world to world, including Tatooine and Hoth. Of course, some of this may change, but FORCE COMMANDER seems to be very much alive. Alas, LucasArts isn't ready to talk about it, as the company wants to keep attention focused on the upcoming Episode I games. YOU WANT IT, WE GOT IT Face it-you and everyone you know are dying to know about the movie. Here's a couple of gratuitous film shots to tide you over while you're standing in line.

"Networked Gaming NECTED? by Dave Salvator, Denny Atkin & Loyd Case home network is in your future. You may already have one, but if you don't, there's a herd of companies betting that it's something you'll soon want. And why not? With PC prices dropping by the day, multiple PC households are becoming more common. And what's the point of having multiple PCs in your home if you can't play multiplayer games on them? Oh sure, there are the spousal selling angles of all those \"work-related\" applications, like file sharing and printer sharing, and having multiple boxes share an Internet connection, and all the rest, but come on, the real reason to get networked is to invite friends over, and deep-six 'em (virtually speaking, of course). The home network is not a new concept. A couple of network cards, a hub, and some cabling and you're in business. That method will work just fine, especially if all you want to do is network together a couple of machines in your basement. But what if your rigs are in different rooms? Or, what if one of those machines is a laptop? That's where these new networking kits come in, because they'll enable you to connect machines together in a variety of ways. These new networking options include wireless, USB, phone lines, and electrical wiring as ways of making the connection. Each has its upsides and downsides, but among them there's probably one that's a good fit for you. Of course, once you've got your home network together and have had a bunch of regulars over for multiplayer mayhem, it won't be long before you're going to want to go looking for trouble online. But to make the most of the experience, especially with multiple machines sharing the line, you should consider a high-speed Internet connection like XDSL or a cable modem. \"Egads,\" you say. So many options. So many considerations. Not to mention a ton of techno-twaddle to shovel through. What's a poor gamer to do? Simple, dear reader, leave it to us. On the following pages, we'll get you straight on what's the best home network for gaming, what's your best Internet connection choice, and how to get the whole contraption humming like a well-oiled machine. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"LAN: WHAT MATTERS LAN REVIEWS The Best Home LAN ARE YOUCONNECTED ma. (LAN) and the Internet, and the machine running it routes traffic for the other nodes on your LAN to the Net. A key consideration for you here is whether the proxy server software can route the User Datagram Protocol, or UDP. Games whose multiplayer modes use TCP/IP tend to use UDP, so it's important that your home LAN's proxy server be able to route UDP traffic to and from the machines on your network. Otherwise, you'll have no online gaming for your network, With home networking kits, it turns out that one size does not fit all. Because nearly all of them deliver acceptable ping times, your decision should be based more on connection method, quality of proxy server software, and price. LAN low ping times All LAN nodes can game on the Net efore considering any of the kits in this feature, stop to consider a few questions: How many computers do you want to connect? Where are they in the house? Will friends be bringing their rigs over, hoping to quickly patch them into your network? Do you mind going through your existing copper (phone lines or house wiring), or do you want the whole deal to be wireless? Getting a handle on these kind of questions will help you figure out which of these kits makes sense for you. Among the WHAT MATTERS: contestants, you've got a wide variety of speed offerings. Some are very fast (100Mbits/sec) and some are pretty slow (384Kbits/sec): most are somewhere in between. But three things matter more than top-end data rate: latency, latency, and, uh, did we mention latency? What is latency? Simply pul. latency is the amount of time it takes to get a \"packet\" of data from Rig A to Rig B, and for Rig B to send back an acknowledgment. Admittedly, superspeedy ping times (technospeak for latency) matter most in twitch-type games-shooters, sports, driving, flight sims-but it follows that if these types of games run smoothly on a network, then less-taxing titles should also run without a hitch. Several of these kits ship with some kind of connection sharing utility, also called a proxy server. This utility is the gateway between your local area network Diamond HomeFree Wireless * * * * * A connection method that works for you High speed software shields you from the details of Windows networking. The installer also installs WinNat Internet sharing software, allowing you to share a single Internet connection between machines. The HomeFree connection is reliable, if not perky. Our 10MB file-copy test took more than 4 minutes-compare that to 17 seconds for a typical wired 10Base-T network. However, ping times between computers were very good (even better than some wired solutions), so you can count on smooth gameplay in networked games. The WinNat software lets you transparently share a single Internet connection for gamingwe had no problems running games, including HALF-LIFE and YOU DON'T KNOW JACK: THE NETSHOW, over a Home Free connection to a cable modemequipped host. Be warned that HomeFree Wireless can be sensitive to metal objects, and metal desks or wall beams, or even an ironing board, can cause your connection to slow.

Most home networks are peer-to-peer, which means that each system on the network is considered equal to the others, and there is no central server that all other machines have to connect to. Ping Time: Originally a Unix utility for measuring the latency between computers on o network, It's now a more generic way of describing lag time over network connections. connect the cable to the parallel port on the computer, and run the installation software. The installation is highly automated-you don't need to know anything about protocols, IP addresses, or network adapters. Il couldn't be simpler. The performance picture, however, isn't as pretty. PassPort is indeed simple, but it's also the slowest of the home networking solutions. Its ping times for HALF-LIFE ranged from 38-50 milliseconds (ms), and POPULOUS' DirectPlay ping times were 20-35ms. While this is fine for gaming (especially compared to Internet ping times), it was slower than the other solutions we reviewed. In addition, its data-transfer rate is extremely slow-it took almost 10 minutes to move our 10MB test file from one system to another. The final straw is the WinProxy proxy server software. HALF-LIFE couldn't see any servers from the second system, while GameSpy could catalog servers. but all of them had infinite ping times. If all you want is simple installation, local network gaming, and limited file and print sharing the PassPort may be a good answer, but it's not a good allaround gaming solution.

"LAN REVIEWS HOW THEY CONNECT ARE YOU CONNECTED File and Print sharing to allow the connected machines to share resources. You'll have to manually add TCP/IP, which can be a bit daunting for the uninitiated. But once installed, EZ-Link runs like a champ. All ping times were on par with a typical 10-Base-T Ethernet LAN (in the 17-32ms range). Also, EZ-Link achieved a 1.9Mbit/sec data rate in our 10MB file-transfer test, close to its claimed top-end data rate of 2Mbit/sec. In past tests using USB game controllers, EZ-Link was a well-behaved bus citizen, allowing Logitech's WingMan Force joystick to operate hiccup-free. EZ-Link is ideal for point-to-point connections between two machines because of its ease of setup and its relatively cheap price. And while you can network many more than two rigs. you'll need an EZ-Link device for cach additional box, so it can get pricey. If you're looking to hook up more than two systems, consider other \"same-room\" home LAN options. But with EZ-Link, for about $90. you get easily installed networking between two boxes without having to crack open either one's case. wire networking. However, we wound up being pleasantly surprised, even though the HomeFree Phone Line isn't completely without flaws. Installation requires popping open each system and inserting a PCI card. The hardware installation instructions are fairly well written, though they are a little terse for our tastes. We hit one installation glitch: Our \"test-bed\" has two phone numbers coming in, so ELITIK US the printers, game controllers, and yes, even networking hardware, Anchor Chips produces EZLink, a USB device with a very straightforward installation. But what's very cool is that once EZLink is installed, you can dynamically enable/disable networking in Windows by simply plugging in or unplugging the EZ-Link device. In an OS notorious for \"Change one little networking detail and reboot so it'll take effect,\" this is no small feat. EZ-Link installs its driver, Microsoft's IPX/SPX protocol, its own EZ-Link Manager that shows active connections, and Microsoft we naturally plugged the wires into two separate jacks, each with a different number. Neither system could see the other. According to Diamond, this is a fairly rare occurrence-most dual-line installations should work properly. Nonetheless, such a pitfall should be documented in the manual (it wasn't). Attaching a splitter to a single phone jack solved the problem. Software installation was pretty easy, and the defaults picked by Diamond worked well. In fact, the installation software did a great job of visually walking you through the hardware installation of the first and second systems.

"LAN REVIEWS HOW THEY CONNECT ARE YOUCONNECTED LAN ping times were quite good, equaling 100Base-T Ethernet ping times. HALF-LIFE's ping was 28-34ms, while ping time for POPULOUS was 12-15ms. Diamond uses Deefield Software's WinGate Home for its Internet sharing. WinGate is a little more complex than WinProxy, but it worked well with some games. We could never get the second system to see servers directly from within HALF-LIFE, though QUAKE Il servers were visible using GameSpy, with decent ping times. WinGate added a little overhead: its ping was about 10ms slower than the direct connection to the Internet. STARCRAFT also ran well over Battle.Net, so HALF-LIFE seems to be a bit of an oddity. Our 10MB test file copied in a minute and a half-close to the maximum rated transfer rate of 1Mbit/sec. That's a testament to the efficiency of the telephone networking gear, but it's still fairly slow. problem all-too-common for serious gamers, especially those of us with 3D cards. USB's Plug-andPlay nature also makes it attractive to those don't want to dive into the hell of opening a PC and trying to get a plug-and-pray expansion card working. Given that network cards can be especially troublesome, we found ADS Technologies USB to Ethernet adapter idea very appealing. The good news is that the device works without a glitch. Plug it into one of your PC's USB ports, attach a cable to your network hub (or a crossover cable to another 10Base-T adapter), pop in the included floppy disk, and you're ready to rock. You will need to configure your networking protocols in Windows (as is the case with most network adapters), but the included manual does a good job of walking you through the process. Hot plugging is handled well: Attach the adapter and Windows will bring up your network connections automatically; remove it and your network resources go away. The ADS unit worked reliably when it was connected directly to desktop and notebook USB ports, as well as when it was connected to a four-port S USB TO ONS USE ADS USB to Ethernet * * * * * T TSB devices are wonderful U solutions for those of us who are expansion slot-challenged-a Ethernet hub. It also functioned properly when simultaneously doing a scan on a USB scanner attached to the same hub. The downside to going the USB route is speed. Ping times were a bit high in games, but not enough to affect smooth performance in HALF-LIFE. However, file copies over Ethernet were half the speed of internal network adapters. Notebook users, don't believe the box's claim of faster speeds than PCMCIA network cards-a 10MB file that took 17 seconds to copy using a PCMCIA connection took twice as long, 35 seconds. on the USB device. Still, it's a fairly fast solution, and it would be hard to find a network adapter that's easier to connect or install.

"THE USE OF A PROXY SERVER  LAN REVIEWS D-Link 100-Base-T Networking Kit * * * * GAMING EDITORS' CHOICE ARE YOUCONNECTED TAThen the folks at D-Link told us VV they had a 100Mbit Ethernet kit for $100, we couldn't help being impressed. For your mere hundred simoleans, you get a tiny, four-port hub, two PCI Ethernet cards, a pair of 20-foot Category 5 Ethernet cables, drivers, and a CD with a couple of shareware games-not a bad deal. The downside is that you have to know a little more about setting up hardware than with the other home networking kits. If you go with the default Windows 95/98 installation, the setup isn't too bad, but you end up with dynamically assigned TCP/IP addresses, which can be problematic. For best performance, you need to go into the network control panel and make some adjustments-something not for the faint-oftweak. Making all the connections is pretty easy. though you should consider carefully where you place the hub-it has a tiny fan that is relatively quiet, but THE BEST LAN/INTERNET CONNECTION aming on the Internet can be a gas, but it's somewhat anonymous. Even when you play online with friends using some kind of speech communication kit, it's not the social experience of having a good friend nearby. But hosting LAN parties can get to be a big chore, too. Finding big blocks of time to set up PCs and a network is a pain, so those happen pretty infrequently. On the other hand, now that you have your twinPC home LAN, you can play locally-but having only two players limits your options somewhat. Wouldn't it be cool to be able to go Internet gamecrawling with a buddy? Here's one inexpensive way to get that party started. It's called a proxy server. This technology has long been used by large companies as a sort of buffer between a company's network and the wild, wooly Internet. But lately, there have been low-cost alternatives for small LANs. Several of the home LAN packages ship with proxy software, including WinProxy and Win Gate. Kali, a package designed to make IPX network games work over the Internet, also has a proxy server available, though it works only with Kali-approved games. Of the three proxy options, WinGate is probably your best bet, though even it is not perfect. We were able to connect to QUAKE Il servers and Battle.Net servers (on the Internet) from a second system through another computer using a single user account. In both cases, games played fine, and there was no noticeable lag (beyond the normal lag you encounter playing games over the Net). However, we never got HALF-LIFE to directly connect to servers. Despite repeated tries, we could never get connected to any game server using WinProxy. The proxy server from Kali works fine for Kali-approved games. At $69 for a three-user license, the home version of Win Gate ranks as the cheapest way to take a couple of friends out on the Net looking for trouble. -Loyd Case can be annoying if you place it right next to your desk. The other problem comes from the wiring. If your systems are in the same room, you're all set, but wiring multiple rooms with Category 5 cabling can be unsightly (if you run cables across the floor) or a real chore (if you pull wire through the walls). Still, for $99, you get 100Mbit performance. As an example, our 10MB lest file moved from one system to another in 2.8 seconds. Contrast that with the minute and a half on the Diamond Home Free Phone Line kit. Ping times were about the same as with Homel'ree: 20-33ms for HALF-LIFE and 12-15ms for POPULOUS. All in all, the D-Link Home Networking Kit is a real bargain if you don't mind the limitations of the cabling and having to be a little network-savvy, D-Link 100-Base-T Networking Kit PROS: It's really fast; good ping times; fairly easy to install. CONS: Multiroom setups are a chore; you have to know a little about Windows networking. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: System with free PCI slot: Window 95/98. $99 (MSRP).

"DATA HOW WE TESTED HOME LAN KITS How We Tested ARE YOU CONNECTED? Home LAN Kits o shake down the home LAN kits, we focused primarily on ping time, since that factor more than any other will determine the quality of your networked gaming experience. For starters, we tested each LAN kit using Windows 98's PING.EXE utility, which measures the round-trip time it takes for a packet containing 32 bytes of data to move over TCP/IP. We took 50 samples and then averaged them. Next, we did a file-transfer test in which we copied a 10MB file using Windows' peer-to-peer networking, and we timed the transfer. From that we calculated the sustained transfer rate, which is often less than the data rate the product vendor claims. We then fired up HALF-LIFE (version 1.08), which uses TCP/IP for its multiplayer games, started a server on one machine, and then had the second machine connect to it. We measured the ping time reported by the game after connecting. We also did some extensive play-testing (okay, it was a good excuse to play a lot of HALF-LIFE) to check to see if the ping times would spike during some of the heated battles. Next, we booted up POPULOUS: THE BEGINNING, started a server over DirectPlay's IPX, and connected the second machine. We then measured the ping times as reported in the lobby screen you see before the game begins. If the LAN kit came with Internet connection sharing or proxy server software, we tested to see if a machine on the LAN (one that wasn't directly connected to the Internet) could connect and play HALF-LIFE. This tested whether the bundled gateway software could route UDP traffic, a key feature to allow all boxes on the LAN to game on the Internet.

"HOW WE TESTED INTERNET CONNECTIONS DATA Internet Connection Options ARE YOUCONNECTED nce again, the ping is the thing. We focused on the first hop-often called the Terminal Serverthat 56K modems, ISDN, DSL, and cable modems all make. If you know the ping time to that first hop, you can get a good idea as to how much of your total ping time to anywhere else on the Internet is due to the connectivity device. For testing 56K modems, we trekked down to ZD Labs, the mothership of testing labs for all of ZD, and got on the labs' TAS line simulator, a device that can simulate different line conditions that you find on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). We ran the modems through three common line conditions, ranging from clean to mediocre to dirty. The quality of a phone line is determined by a number of factors, including line noise, the type of routing equipment the signal passes through, and the distances the signal has to travel. We took 20 ping time samples at each line condition, and then averaged the 60 samples to come up with an average across the three conditions. What we saw, not surprisingly, is that as the line condition worsened, initial connect speeds went down and ping times went up. We then connected to MindSpring, a well-known national ISP, and looked at initial connect speed and ping-time to terminal server as a \"reality check\" of our lab numbers. Finally, using GameSpy, we measured the ping times of several specific HALF-LIFE servers and took an average. You should keep in mind that as soon as the Internet becomes part of your test-bed, results can vary wildly. But since this is how you'll be using these modems, it made sense for us to conduct these tests. So the GameSpy ping-time numbers we present here are a reasonable indicator, but not the be-all-and-end-all, and should be taken with a grain of salt. For IDSN, DSL, and cable modem, we again measured ping time to terminal server and took an average of ping times on several HALF-LIFE servers via GameSpy. These numbers are much lower than 56K modems, and most gamers report a correspondingly better gaming experie nce online, but again, don't forget that grain of Net salt.

"CONNECTING TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. WAITING FOR DSL The Best Internet Connections VARE YOU CONNECTEDZ higher data rates, have about a 40-50 millisecond ping-time advantage over older V.34 modems. And with the arrival of the V.90 56K standard, you get a broader choice of modems, provided your ISP supports V.90, which most do (or soon will). Here then, we present \"A Tale of Three Connections,\" as recounted by Denny \"Cable Guy\" Atkin and Loyd \"DieSeL\" Case. These two have had different rides on the bumpy road to highspeed connectivity, and while theirs are just two stories, we've heard many like them from readers. Again, appreciate that we're in the San Francisco Bay Area, and must deal with TCI's Home and Pacific Bell. You may have a very different experience from those of our two adventurers. We'll also take a look at four 56K modems that will still get the job done if no high-speed options are available yet in your area. INTERNET TERS: type of DSL, can deliver around 1.6Mbits/sec. In addition, cable modems are well ahead of XDSL in deployment. It also turns out that, in most cases, cable modems are cheaper for now (most cable companies are pricing their services aggressively at about $40-S50 per month). The dark side to this brave new world of high-speed connectivity is whether or not current Internet service providers (ISPs) that operate over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) will be locked out. Cable companies have made it plainly clear that they don't intend to allow third-party ISPs access to their \"last mile\" of copper that goes into your home. The telephone companies, who are more heavily regulated in this area, probably won't be as stingy with their infrastructure. A group of ISPs and concerned Netizens have formed the Open NET coalition (www.opennetcoalition.org) to try to keep access to these new digital avenues open and compelitive. The fear is that if cable companies and Telcos can shut out third-party ISPs, competition would be greatly stifled and the rates we pay for Internet access would head north. If neither of these services is yet available in your area, you may be using a 56K modem for a while yet. If you haven't yet made the move to a 56K modem, then now's the time. Most 56K modems, in addition to posting low ping times M he \"World Wide Wait\" may finally be over. If you've become an expert thumb-twiddler waiting for Web pages to load (and for online multiplayer games to start), we feel your pain. But two new technologies-cable modems and XDSL-could well change your Net connection from a cocktail straw to a high-pressure garden hose. Both offer much faster data rates than 56K modems, and more important, both offer much lower ping times than most of us have had to endure up to now. But CONNECTIONS because different cable and WHA local phone companies enjoy their little regional fiefdoms, the kind of service that may be available to you very much depends on where you live. costs Some system makers, like Dell, have programs through which they'll sell you the compatible equipment you'll need to make a high-speed connection in your area. If you're close to a major metropolitan area, chances are you've got one or both services either available now or becoming available within the next year. But if you're in a more remote area, then you may just have to hurry up and wail. Check with your local phone and cable companies to see what services they offer, or plan to offer. The race for the hearts, minds. and dollars of Internet users is in full swing, and it would seem that cable modems have the upper hand, for now anyway. Cable modems have data rates ranging from 5-10Mbits/sec, whereas XDSL, depending on the fast data rate low monthly Network security Loyd: Waiting for DSL M here are apparently more flavors of digital subI scriber line (DSL) than there are Jelly Belly flavors.

Looks as though I'm all dressed up with no place to surf. As a side note, I was able to test a 144 Kbps IDSL (a sort of DSL/ISDN hybrid) line at ZD Labs, whose DSL service comes from NorthPoint. We found its ping times both to terminal server and to various GameSpy servers to be about on par with cable modem, despite this implementation's lower data rate. : WRACTIVE www.shadowcompany.com "


"ON THE CABLE AUTOBAHN ISDN User 128 How Cable Modems Work User 22 A Cable Modem connects to JPC via Ethernet Television especially if you find other players with high-speed connections. I had no trouble doing tight formation flying in WWII FIGHTERS, and for the first time I've found Net play in 3D shooters like HALF-LIFE not only tolerable, but enjoyable. CARE_you coNNECTED Cable Company Pemisis Television Cable ModemP C High-speed link to internet backbone GRUser 3 Hub PC Cable Modem Won't you be my neighbor? Although cable modems offer higher top-end data rates and larger availability of service, they could possibly bog down if too many people in your neighborhood get the service and are all connected at once. Denny: On the Cable Autobahn nce you've had a cable modem, there's no going back. Blazing file transfers, near LAN-speed Internet games, and an always-on connection to the Internet are perks that are very easy to get addicted to. Web pages just magically appear, pictures and all, and playing a game against other cable modem users is like having them in the same room. The technology does have a few pitfalls, however. You're essentially on a network with everyone in your neighborhood, and there have been incidents of people bogarting bandwidth and causing performance problems for others, not to mention some digital voyeurism (remember to turn File Sharing oll). Also, while cable providers do give you firewall protection, there are obvious security issues if you leave your PC connected to a public network 24/7. The biggest snag, of course, is that cable modems are still available only in seemingly randomly scattered markets. That said, if this technology is available where you are, get it. Get it now. For gaming, make sure that your provider offers bidirectional cable modems. There are some services using more primitive equipment that uses cable to receive data and a phone line to transmit—the lag introduced by this technology makes gaming performance really suffer. I've been using Home's cable modem service for about three months now with nary a glitchthere was a single day when the network went down for a few hours, but that's something that has happened with every dial-up ISP I've used. Installation was a snap. The installers visit your house, put a splitter on your television cable (you don't have to have cable TV service active to use a cable modem, but you must be wired for it), plug in the cable modem, and attach it to a network card in your PC. TCI, our local cable provider, includes a free network card with installation and includes the cost of cable modem rental in the $40 per month bill. The only potential caveat is location if your computer isn't near a cable TV outlet, some additional wiring may be necessary. While Web browsing can be inconsistent-your connection remains fast, but popular sites can still seem slow because they feed you the data slower than your cable modem can accept it-gaming is pure bliss. Low ping times and fast data transmission make multiplayer gaming a silky smooth experience, Loyd: ISDN-Still Mavbe After All These Years urrently, I'm using Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) for my Net connection. ISDN is purely digital, which is a great advantage over even dual modem technologies like Diamond's Shotgun. In California, at least, ISDN is expensive because there's a perminute charge during normal working hours and a 200-hour limit on free time in the evenings and weekends. Each minute is fairly cheap, and you get some time included in the base rate from Pacific Bell, but it adds up very quickly if you work out of your house-especially since the charge is doubled if you use both lines. ISDN is a great story of missed opportunities on the part of all the phone companies. If they had priced ISDN the way they price standard phone lines, ISDN would be much more prevalent. Each ISDN line is actually two phone lines with discrete data channels (called Bchannels). They can usually be paired up (bonded) when higher speeds are required, though some services (CompuServe, for example) support only a single B-channel. The maximum speed for each B-channel is 64Kbps (or 128Kbps when the two channels are combined). Because ISDN is digital, ping times are quite low. With ISDN Architecture 3 Channels Twisted Pair Cable B channel 56/64 Kbps B channel 56/64 Kbps D channel 16 Kbps Faster, yet slower: Although a good deal slower than cable or XDSL, ISDN may still be a better choice than a 56K modem, depending on pricing and availability in your area.

"56K MODEMS GameSpy, I see ping times as low as 70-80ms. WonNet (the site that hosts HALF-LIFE deathmatches on the Net) servers' ping times are a little higher. Running directly from HALF-LIFE, I see ping times that are as low as 50-60ms. That's definitely an edge in deathmatches and someone as reflex-impaired as me needs every edge he can get. The bottom line is that if ISDN is the only digital alternative in your area, it may be worth investigating. Check the rates, though. But if you can get DSL or cable, go for one of those instead. ARE YOU CONNECTED The Best 56k Modem rodems have come a mighty long way from the days of persnickety V.34 28.8 Lmodems that you were lucky just to get connected. Now, 56K is the order of the day. And with the arrival of the V.90 standard, you no longer have to flip a coin as to which kind of 56K modem to get. While 56K modems pale in comparison to their high-speed cousins, there's still some online gaming fun to be had driving in the 56K lane. We wanted to look at 3Com/USR's PCI WinModem, but the company was unwilling to send us a unit, citing performance concerns\" with its current firmware (read: it's currently not a great performer). In fact, you should probably avoid WinModems altogether because they have less onboard processing horsepower, which means they have to use more CPU cycles than other modems do. This is why WinModems are less expensive. We still recommend external modems for their ease of installation and lack of configuration headaches. What we've seen, in most cases, is that performance among 56K modems has become pretty consistent. That fact helps shift your buying decision over to price, form-factor, or, in some rare instances, bundled software. Still, we went looking to something a bit different, and even among the \"ho-hum\" 56K modems we came across two that connect via USB and pull power from the USB port-eliminating the muchloathed wall-wart power supply. Shark Leopard Pocket USB Modem * * M odems the size of credit cards are old hat. IVIBut how about a modem the size of a pack of gum?

"56K MODEM REVIEWS Pocket VARE_YOU_CONNECTED V.90 external modem. We still like the Multi Modem USB for its ease of installation and overall performance, though Diamond's SupraExpress 56e edged it out in performance tests. The MultiTech supports both V.90 and K56Flex 56K standards. After connecting the modem to your USB port and feeding the computer a driver disk, this one's ready to roll. Across the three simulated line conditions, the MultiTech nipped at Diamond's heels for best ping times, and was within 3ms of Diamond in our tests connecting to MindSpring. In our GameSpy tests at HALFLIFE servers, the Multi Tech was about 15ms slower on ping times to servers than Diamond. Another low point was that the MultiTech had the lowest initial connect speeds across the clean and mediocre line conditions. For about $20-$30 more than the Diamond SupraExpress 56e, MultiTech gives you a clean USB implementation of a modem that achieves solid performance. The lack of wall-wart is an added bonus. If you're someone who's socket-challenged and you're looking for a 56K modem, vou should consider the MultiTech. and aside from its generally stout performance, it is otherwise unremarkable. The first annoyance is that the modem doesn't arrive ready to roll straight out of the box. This modem doesn't ship with a serial cable, which you need to connect the unit to your PC. And given that U.S. Robotics modems tend to be on the pricier side, this goes from annoying to inexcusable. The unit does install painlessly and is up and running (sans reboot) within a few minutes. Performance is generally solid across the board, and this guy achieved the highest initial connect speeds across our three simulated line conditions. When draws only 5 milliamps of current in idle mode and only 45 milliamps when connected online, less than a quarter of the power required by typical PC Card modems. A pretty impressive offering, or so we thought. Then we saw its ping times. Despite good initial connect speeds across our three simulated line conditions, the Leopard had very high ping times, with the result being very poky online gameplay. Just how high were they? The three other modems' average ping times ranged from 170-190ms across different line conditions, whereas Leopard averaged 318ms, well in excess of any other modem tested. And the story didn't get any better in GameSpy tests. If you spend a lot of time on the road and are looking for a compact 56K modem for getting email and surfing the Web, Leopard might be a candidate.

Diamond SupraExpress 56e * * * * * ARE YOUCONNECTED CAMING EDITORS CHOICE The SupraExpress 56e is a I solid, low-cost, no-frills modem. The 9-pin serial cable is permanently attached to the unit. so if you have a 25-pin port, you'll need to get an adapter, (it's not supplied). Most PCs these days have 9-pin ports, though, so it may not affect you. The device is smaller than a paperback book, but it does require a power brick (albeit a small one). The Supra 56e is a Plug-and-Play device, so setup is quite easy. Attach the modem, turn on your system, and install the driver from the supplied CD-ROM. The SupraExpress 56e supports both K56flex and V.90 standards, but check your ISP before you spend your dough on this device. The software bundle is limited, but it does have a cool feature in the included Shotgun software. If you have another Supra, you can pair them up for a total theoretical throughput of 112 Kbps. The gotcha is the word theoretical. With the voltage limitations of current phone lines, you're really limited to a maximum of 2x53Kbps, or 106Kbps. And that's the downstream speeds under ideal conditions. The Shotgun technology doesn't seem to affect ping times, though. It's still an analog modem at heart. Be aware that your ISP has to support the Shotgun technology, so check with your provider before you rush out and buy a second modem.

This holds true from the smallest local area network to the Internet. Currently, the main bottleneck to a better Internet experience is most likely your modem. But as highbandwidth connections become more commonplace for con sumers, the Internet's bottleneck is going to move to other parts of the network, such as slow servers or routers. Addressing this problem, a consortium of 141 universities across the United States is currently working on Internet2, a very high-bandwidth large network that will allow things like large numbers of real-time video streams and faster overall network performance. As you read this, Internet developers have most likely begun the first trial, flipping the switch on a new high-speed backbone network. The Abilene project, the key subnetwork that makes up the backbone for Internet2, will consist of a 13,000-mile, 2.4-Gbps research network-240 times faster than 10-Mbps ethernetconnecting 150 universities and My, What Big Pipes You Have The Abilene network provides an environment in which researchers and industry participants can test new technologies to solve the bandwidth constraints, quality-of-service problems, and security issues that plague the public Internet. The fruits of that work will eventually trickle down to corporate Internet users. In fact, the goal of the 10-month-old Abilene project is to make the Internet as widely available and as reliable as the conventional telephone network. Quality of service is a very important aspect of Abilene. \"We have to figure out how to provide QoS if we want to make the Internet a ubiquitous medium,\" says Brian McFadden, vice president and general manager in the Carrier Packet Solutions group at consortium member Nortel Networks, in Brampton, Ontario. \"Abilene allows the development of the next generation of Internet applications and takes the speed issue off of the table.\" For more on Internet2, go to www.internet2.edu.

Matrox and S3 Fresh From the Foundry icrosoft's Windows Hardware Engineering Conference (WinHEC) is looking more like DIM D ay for graphics chipmakers. 3Dfx, nVidia, 3D Labs, and now s3 and Matrox are all aimIV ing to land their newest offerings on the beaches of WinHEC, which is slated to take place in Los Angeles in early April. IROM WORKS S3 enjoyed some success with its Savage3D, which was the chipmaker's mea culpa for its disappointing ViRGE line. Savage3D offered good performance and S3's S3TC texture compression, which Microsoft licensed as the standard texture compression for DirectX 6's Direct3D. Although other chipmakers have been loath to adopt the standard, S3 has been singing its praises, showing UNREAL TOURNAMENT demos using huge textures that show off S3TC's main benefit: letting developers use very high-res textures without completely eating graphics card memory bandwidth. S3's next chip, the Savage4, will come in two flavors: the Savage GT and the Savage4 Pro. The Pro will offer a peak fill rate to 143Mpixels/sec. But S3 says that the Savage4 will maintain that level of performance running singlepass multitextured games using trilinear filtering, a feat few other chips can match. The Pro will offer AGP 4x support and 32MB onboard memory support. The GT, a more \"mainstream\" part, will be an AGP 2x part with 16MB onboard memory support and a peak fill rate of 125Mpixels/sec. When running single-textured games, Savage4 may not fare as well as other parts, but as multitexturing titles proliferate, Savage4 may be more of a contender Matrox has been at work on its new G400 accelerator, an AGP 4x part that will feature 32MB onboard memory support, a 300MHz RAMDAC, and Matrox's new 256-bit DualBus internal architecture, which is two 128-bit buses operating in parallel. Matrox doesn't often disclose many performance specs, but the company expects the G400 to be about three times as fast as its current G200, with a peak fill rate in the neighborhood of 250Mpixels/sec. G400 will also support stencil-butter and \"true\" hardware bump-mapping, which looks better than the embossing ellect some other chips use. We expect first silicon from $3 and Matrox very soon, so stay tuned to 3D IronWorks to see how these chips fare. --Dave Salvator COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1999 www.computergaming.co "

"Audio's Voice Is Changing HARDWAR The Evolution From Sound Cards to Audio Accelerators by Loyd Case know it sometimes seems as if we're speaking in tongues If you've played THIEF, you know what a difference the positional audio cues can make as to whether you're fit to move on or fit for a coffin. 3D games, and your trusty CPU performed all of the 3D heavy lifting to render a scene and write it to your graphics card's memory. Now, of course, we have 3D accelerators, some of which rival the complexity of your main processor at the chip level. Audio is moving steadily in that direction too, and it's actually making for some exciting and immersive gaming experiences. ogy, especially when it comes to the area of 3D graphics. Anisotropic filtering, trilinear mip-mapping, stencil buffers. Sheesh, enough already. Well, guess what? Sound cards are undergoing a similar sea change Last month, I tried to clarify some of the language we use to talk about 3D graphics cards, so this month, it made sense to try to make sense of some of the verbiage you'll hear when we review the latest sound cards. The first change is that sound card makers no longer call their products \"sound cards.\" The new term bandied around now is audio accelerator. And though the term seems a little fluffy, it's not entirely inaccurate. Consider the graphics card analogy. To Stereo and Beyond Back in the 1930s, Alan Blumlein patented the first electronic method for creating stereo sound. Most of us have two good ears. Much like the ability to per ceive depth that a pair of eyes gives us, two ears allow us to per ceive the direction and distance of a particular sound. Stereo was the first step along the way, creating a sense of 2D space, or a \"soundstage,\" for audio. Like 2D graphics, 2D audio is limited. Unlike with 3D graphics, though, the technology is there to actually add a feeling of space to the sound field. Except for limited solutions like LCD shutter glasses Also like graphics, it's relatively easy to create the impression of a static 3D audio world. For example, using a 3D-modeling tool like Lightwave 3D, we can (relatively easily) create a \"movie\" that looks like it's moving through three dimensions, but isn't at all interactive. Similarly, solutions like Dolby ProLogic or AC-3 are great at being able to reproduce 3D audio effects from a canned playback (the movie or TV), but the effect will be exactly the same every time you play it, because it's canned. And don't even get me started on \"interactive movies.\" It's All Calculus to Me Like real-time 3D graphics, 3D audio has a lot of underlying math. And like 3D graphics, there are a number of ways of doing it. One way is the use of a headrelated transfer function (HRTF), LOYD CASE Anisotropic filtering, trilinear mip-mapping-sheesh, enough already. in the distant past (more than two years ago), graphics cards were really just \"dumb frame and weird VR headsets, we're which is a mathematical function buffers\" in really trapped by our computer that models the way your ear monitors in trying to create a hears sound.

"Tech Tips LARDWAR I've been playing QUAKE, QUAKE II, HALF-LIFE or other shooters online, and I sometimes Yo notice that my mouse response can get jerky. This results in missing easy targets and getting fragged for no good reason. Is there any way to fix this? It turns out that the sampling rate of the PS/2 mouse is somewhere around 25Hz (25 no times per second), and if it doesn't sync up properly with the frame rate, you can get slight pauses in the action. This usually isn't a big deal in single-player mode, but in multiplayer, every slight edge or disadvantage can be multiplied. Some folks in Finland have felt your pain and have developed ps2rate, a small utility that changes the sampling rate. Put \"ps2rate--60\" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and you may see much smoother action. You can pick up ps2rate at www.students.tut.fi/-zibbo/other/, n I have a USB gamepad and a regular joystick, but most of my games seem to default to the joystick. In fact, many can't even see the gamepad, even though it's listed in the game controller control panel. What gives? Most game developers haven't come to grips with the idea of multiple controllers yet. m. In fact, until DirectX 6.0, it wasn't really possible due to bugs in DirectX. So unfortunately, we'll just have to wait until more games make full use of DirectInput. At that point, we should be able to pick and choose from a list of controllers. the sound has to remain constant as you move through the virtual world. Thus, the sound environment has to be every bit as interactive as the visual environment. In fact, companies like Sensaura (which evolved out of EMI Records' research labs), Aureal, and Creative Labs have been hard at work on this problem. But it goes beyond just doing a lot of math. Sensaura, for example, has built digital \"ears\" (pictured on the previous page) to better model how the ear actually works. Using these ears, Sensaura has studied and modeled how humans localize a sound in 3D space. The latest generation of 3D audio cards allows game designers to create a reasonably fluid sound 3D environment. Again, as with 3D graphics, the 3D sound designer has to have tools to allow the audio streams to change as you move through the game's virtual world. Interestingly, much of this information can come right out of the 3D graphics environment. A 3D sound designer can look at the layout of, say, an UNREAL level and know that if a particular monster is in room A, then a player in room B will hear it off in one direction, whereas a player in room C might hear it from a different direction. Creating 3D audio in two speakers is tough, though. Remember our HRTFs? Those little math algorithms cause CPUs to work pretty damned hard to get any kind of realistic audio out of two speakers. Even then, it's not perfect. Tests of fairly sophisticated HRTF setups show that there's always a quiet zone that's directly behind the center of our heads. Vertical cues can be equally tough to perceive (though a good set of headphones can be better than speakers). Four speakers are better, but many of us don't have the space or want the hassle of adding a second set of speakers. But even with four speakers, calculating changes in direction and motion involves some pretty serious math. So the solution is to create 3D audio accelerators, much like 3D graphics accelerators. of CPU used when a sound card is trying to \"render\" audio on DirectSound3D. For more information about Audio WinBench, check out www.zdbop.com. Another parallel in the 3D graphics/audio evolution is the sometimes aggravating area of drivers. Having the latest set of drivers for your sound card is now as critical to system performance and game compatibility as having the latest graphics card drivers. For example, the beta drivers for the Diamond Monster Sound MX300 chewed up 12 percent of a 400MHz Pentium II in a particular Audio WinBench test. Later, with shipping drivers, the CPU usage on the same system with the same test dropped to a bit under 7 percent. Also like 3D graphics, 3D positional audio is somewhat subjective. In the same way that some people like the image quality of one 3D accelerator or game better than another, some people can hear positional 3D effects better than others. The bottom line is that you now have a third sophisticated processor under the hood of your gaming rig. That, of course, makes it even more confusing in some respects. But it will make games all that much more immersive, and in some ways, it's even more exciting than 3D graphics. CGW The Cone of Silence Head as viewed from above Testing, Testing, 1-2-3 So on a very simplistic level, that's a \"picture\" of what's going on under the hood with 3D audio. But like 3D graphics, 3D audio now can have a serious impact on the performance of your computer game. In the past, any attempt at 3D audio was handled by the CPU, and if a game attempted to do serious positional audio (very few did), you'd see your frame rate tank. At CGW, we've begun doing CPU usage tests of this new generation of 3D sound cards using Ziff-Davis' Audio WinBench 99, which gives a solid, empirical number: the percentage 3D Positional Audio Audible Effect Curve This diagram shows the \"quiet zone\" directly behind our heads. A common \"localization error\" we make is thinking that a sound is in front of us when it's really behind us. 134 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. MAY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

CGW photo: Michael Falconer REVIEW THRUSTMASTER SUPER SPORT Sporty, But Not Super by Loyd Case phe Super Sport is billed as ThrustMaster's full-function budget wheel. Unlike the Sprint, with the Super Sport you can use the pedals while the paddle shifters act as shifters. COMPUTER WORLD Unfortunately, the pedals are the weak link in the Super Sport. Both the brake and throttle stand nearly vertical, but the base is fairly light. The result is that the pedals slide all over the floor when you apply any pressure to them. I had to shove a large box behind the base to keep it from shifting, but even then it shifted sideways occasionally. The driver installation was very odd. The software warns you to make sure the wheel is not connected before installing the drivers. Then it prompts you to connect the wheel partway through the setup process. The wheel itself installs easily, and there's a sort of \"vise grip\" clamp that attaches the wheel to the tabletop. All you need to do is adjust it once, then it pops off and on fairly easily, making it a snap to set up for casual driving. ***WW APPEAL: An inexpensive wheel, but you get what you pay for. PROS: Low cost, easy setup. CONS: Wheel control lacks precision; doesn't quite center after calibration. REQUIREMENTS: Standard PC game port: Windows 95/98. Price: $79.99 (MSRP) Mnufacturer: Thrust Master Hillsboro, OR (503) 615-3200 And it's casual driving that this wheel is really designed for. When I ran NEED FOR SPEED III, cars seemed to respond sluggishly when I turned the wheel. The smallest adjustment of direction required a fairly coarse wheel motion, and it was very easy to overcontrol. GRAND PRIX LEGENDS was even worse, since the cars are very touchy as it is. Worse than that, no matter how often I recalibrated, the return to center never seemed to quite center the wheel. This was probably a result of cheap springs in side the wheel more than any electronic issues. In fact, much of the time, I felt like I was turning a big spring rather than a steering wheel. The bottom line is if you're on a tight budget, the Super Sport may be a decent choice. But there are other low-cost wheels available, such as the ACT Labs RS, that are better.

JENSEN JMP-57 SPEAKERS Big Sound for Small Dollars by Loyd Case here have been a host of sub$100 speakers hitting the streets recently, and the real surprise is that most of them there's no power brick. The bass unit is meant to be mounted on a wall or the side of the desk, but it won't stand on its side without support, thus making things a bit inconvenient if you prefer a less permanent mount. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD ***** sound pretty darned good. Add Jensen's JMP-57 model to that mix. It makes the job of choosing speakers that much harder, but it's certainly preferable to the flatulentsounding gear that's been littering the low end of the budget scale, The JMP-57s bear some resemblance to the Advent line of speakers-no real surprise there, since both companies are subsidiaries of Interact. The JMP-57s are the newest members of the Jensen line and are clearly targeted toward more cost-conscious users. The bass unit is identical to the midrange Advent speakers, and the satellites are similar looking, though with a more rounded shape. The volume knob/power switch and a headphone jack are right there on the front of the right satellite. Setup is easy, as the power transformer is in the bass unit; The JMP-57s pump 15 watts into the bass unit and 2.5W into each satellite. Despite the relatively low power, musical material could be played pretty loudly-certainly loud enough for a small home office but on particularly \"hot\" tracks, the drivers distorted badly. They also sounded pretty bright, as if the high midrange had been emphasized. During gameplay, the speakers fared much better. Game audio could be cranked up to pretty high volume without any distortion. The stereo imaging is very good, which helped A3D playback quite a bit If you're looking for a decent set of inexpensive speakers with some nice conveniences, and you don't mind having to mount the speakers on a vertical surface, you could do much worse than the Jensen JMP-57s. CGW APPEAL: Cheap speakers that play loud and sound good. PROS: Pretty loud for budget speakers; decent game sound. CONS: Somewhat bright and lower maximum clean volume when used on musical content REQUIREMENTS: Audio output from sound source.

"REVIEW WICKED3D EYESCREAM Double Vision by Loyd Case hen I finally got the Wicked3D Eyescream stereoscopic glasses going, my jaw dropped. And therein lies the rub: Getting these puppies working requires more tweaking than it did to tune up my COMPUTER GAMING WORLD * ** ** old 1960 Plymouth Valiant. The Eyescreams are an ambitious accomplishment made all the more impressive by the fact that they work at all. That's not a slam on the product. The engineering may be impressive, but ultimately. it's a bolt-on. The Eyescream uses the same shutter glasses that were originally sold by the now-defunct H3D Corporation. H3D's problem was trying to get game developers to build stereoscopic support into games-too few games, too little business. Wicked 3D attacked the problem from the other angle: It made a set of universal Voodoo drivers that would work with any Voodoo card and add stereovision to the games without the game having to be stereo aware. Writing those drivers was an amazing engineering feat. Getting it to work on your system would be an amazing feat, too. I tried the Eyescream with Guillemot's Maxigamer3D II. Wicked 3D puts out a list of games that work with varying results with the Eyescream. The problem is that you can't always rely on the list. TOMB RAIDER III suffered truly awful palette corruption, which made the game unplayable. Many of the listed games lock up when switching to or from the stereo mode. Also, many Glide games require you to manually copy a configuration file to the game directory. The physical setup is some thing of a chore, too, though it does only need to be done once. The software control panel is complex, but the manual does a good job of guiding you through the complexity. When the Eyescream glasses did work, the results made for an APPEAL: Adds that little special some thing to a select few 3D titles. PROS: When it works, the effect is great CONS: Works only with Voodoo'; does not work with all 3D games; requires lots of tweaking REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95/98 with Voodoo card. Price: $129 Manufacturer: Wicked 3D Fremont, CA (510) 494-9700 www.wicked3d.com amazing experience. UNREAL, for example, took on a whole new sense of depth, marred only by the need for you to turn off volumetric lighting. So if you're really looking for that special something to make your games sparkle, the Wicked3D Eyescream is worth a closer look. But be aware that getting to stereoscopic Nirvana may seem like the road to Purgatory. CGW photo: Michael Falconer REVIEW. INTERACT V4 FORCE FEEDBACK WHEEL Interact's Surprise by Loyd Case fter the debacle that was the V3 wheel, I was prepared to be underwhelmed by the V4. The V3 felt rickety, and it just COMPUTER CAMORLD WORLD ***** didn't work in many systems. Interact learned its lesson, though, and when the company decided to do a force feedback wheel it went after proven technology and licensed Microsoft's force-feedback implementation. The Florida company then added a few twists of its own. The V4 can be set to a variety of angles and heights, accommodating different desk heights and users. Getting the adjustment knobs to lock properly is something of a chore, but you usually have to do it only once. Initial setup is a pain, too-espe. cially attaching the mounting brackets. You only have to do this once, however. After that, you just twist a couple of knobs, loosen the Suction cups, and pull it off. The power supply is the \"soap-on-arope\" type, going one better than the original Microsoft wheel, which featured a massive power brick. It's gameplay that matters, so was off to the races with NEED FOR SPEED III and SPEED BUSTERS. The cool thing about this wheel is how well it renders the absence of forces. Push too hard around a corner in NFS III, and you feel the wheel flop loose in your hand. Positive forces—the now familiar bumps and crashes are also rendered to good effect. The pedals are pretty good too-large, and with a fair amount of travel, allowing for relatively precise braking and throttle. Overall, this wheel gets a strong thumbs-up. The only serious negative criticism goes to Interact's placement of a couple of buttons on the wheel right under the heel of the thumb, where they got APPEAL: Budget force-feedback wheel with surprisingly good performance. PROS: Flexible setup: good force resolution; decent pedals CONS: Initial setup a pain; no force editor, some ESS sound cards are problematic REQUIREMENTS: Sound card game port with Sound Blaster-style MIDI pin. Price: $99 (street price) Manufacturer: Interact Lake Mary, FL (407) 333-1392 www.interact-acc.com pressed accidentally and often. It was easy in either the games or the software to move the button assignment, though. There is no force editor per se, so you have to go with what the game provides. While the manual is clearly written, some of the syntax in the online help can only be described as tortured. The V4 can be found for well under $130, and at that price, it's nearing the price of stock analog wheels. So if your wallet's light and you have a hankering to feel the force, check out the V4.

For example, instead of a clear day (like the first time you saw the map), it's nighttime in a thunderstorm in your second go-round. Or, instead of moving north to south as you did before, this time you're going west to east. by Mark Clarkson ARGASM, a combination of thirdperson RTS and first-person shooter, seems to offer much more than just a goofy name. It includes a mixed battlefield in which you can jump into tanks or helicopters or play as an infantryman. And it delivers—but barely. First the good news. The game's engine is a tour de force: The sun actually blinds you if you look into it; wrecks explode and burn, throwing off roiling black smoke; your gun hurls HESH, HEAT, and Sabot rounds at enemy units with impressive muzzle flash, smoke, and recoil; tank treads throw up dust and even deform to follow the landscape. You'll experience day and night, clear weather, thunderstorms, and fog.

The unpatched version of WARGASM offered a choice of five preconfigured setups, some of which seemed impossible for a two-handed player with only one keyboard, and none of which suited me. Controlling infantrymen was easy, if unrealistic, and driving tanks wasn't that hard, but I found the helicopters to be virtually unflyable, especially with my favorite tank control setup. (Try flying a helicopter using AZ for up/down, +/for forward/backward, and the joystick to turn. I dare you.) In fact, the only way this game works, for me at least, is as a \"lite\" tank sim. Third-person control is clumsy and while the hat switch on my Microsoft SideWinder changed the game's views, those on my CH joystick didn't The game would be fun if it weren't for its interface.

Unfortunately THUNDER BRIGADE does not allow for the remapping of 29 keyboard controls, instead begging you to use a joy stick. Graphically, the large fractall voxel maps are nicely rendered, but they lack the crisp detail seen in 3D-accelerated games. Bottom line: THUNDER BRIGADE iS fun and offers long-term playability thanks to its built-in editor. If you're itching for futuristic hovertank action, this should do the trick. -Raphael Liberatore Thunder Brigade in cars with monster-truck tires. Cars that look like animals. Don't worry, I don't really get it either. S.C.A.R.S. does actually sport some nice graphics and fast-paced gameplay that provides some fun moments, but you'll need a decent 3D card to enjoy it, and supported cards are very limited. But on the right system, the game runs at a smooth 30 frames per second. Among the better aspects of S.C.A.R.S. are the tracks. They're very well designed, with shortcuts that sometimes turn out to be long. cuts, varied environments that include an underwater level, changing weather, and the option to play at different times of day. One serious beef I have concerns the cars themselves—in a word, they're ugly. The polygon count is very low, textures are amateurish, and the sprite-based wheels look very out of place. Plus, except for the shark and rhino models, the cars don't look anything like the animals they supposedly represent. Even if the racing shooter has been done better before (the WIPEOUT series comes immediately to mind) S.C.A.R.S. is an inexpensive provider of a few hours of mindless diversion. --Tom Price sounds like a nerd's dream: You've been abducted by a group of aliens known as the Master Race and forced to play deathmatch games with other intergalactic captives. If you win, you get to play more challenging opponents, if you lose, Earth is history. A few years ago, a game like DEAD RECKONING would have caused jaws to spontaneously drop. But in the wake of such recent 3D blastfests as INCOMING or BARRAGE, a good yawn is about all I could muster. Granted, the 360degree action here is brutally fast and unforgiving, which is perfect for players who are all nerve endings and no brain stem. But if you desire more depth in your action gaming, keep looking. Despite the variety of 15 massive cylindrical combat arenas, ranging from punk-industrial to downright hellish, the gameplay is terribly repetitive, especially in single-player mode. Multiplayer action fares a bit better, with support for up to six players via Internet, modem, LAN, or serial connection.

Similar to BATTLEZONE and HAVOC in style if not depth, THUNDER BRIGADE allows you to fly a variety of tanks in 30 search-and-destroy missions on 12 unique planets and moons. The story in THUNDER BRIGADE focuses on three interstellar powers colliding in a struggle for supremacy in the Kildae System: the ruthless Halon Empire, the disciplined Earth Alliance, and the newly formed People's Army of the United Systems. You can play any power in instant action, single-scenario missions, or multiplayer action over Internet or LAN, but the campaign game offers only the United Systems for play.

The soundtrack and opening video introduction imply a fast-paced, interactive movie type of experience. The subsequent gameplay, however, reveals a curious mix of features that may cause some unpleasant surprises for the casual gamer. CERROR HORNET QUAKE One of the most difficult missions in the game has you slowing sneaking through an underground maze. world. Three 10-mission linear campaigns involve military/political flare-ups in Russia, Iraq, and Central America. Your job is clear: Reestablish truth, justice, and the American way. TOP GUN: HORNET'S NEST makes no pretense at being a serious flight sim. Flight models and avionics are clearly arcade, although the FIA-18 you pilot is nowhere near as responsive as a real plane. Airto-ground missiles can't lock onto stationary ground targets, while air-to-air missiles are great against everything. No problem—it's an action game, after all, a chance to vicariously be the star of your own movie, right?

Antitank guns are now more difficult to spot, which means they have a fighting chance of ambushing armored vehicles when deployed in good cover. While this increases the value of these weapons, it also creates an odd situation: A large-caliber, crew-served antitank gun firing from under cover will sometimes remain unspotted while a two-man antitank rifle team hiding in a building without having fired a shot-will be spotted and destroyed by a tank.

Less than three weeks after receiving CLOSE COMBAT III, I had played through the grand campaign on both the Russian and German sides, as well as several operations and numerous single scenarios. In comparison, it took me more than a month of playing CLOSE COMBAT II to complete one side of the campaign. CLOSE COMBAT III has much to recommend it, and I can't say that I didn't have fun playing it. However, I can say that I have little desire to continue playing it, at least as a single-player game.

You're now responsible for finding an outlet for your city's garbage, which might THE GENESIS OF TOOMSUBA Initial zoning of a potential seaside utopia. by Jeff Lackey lot of unpleasant things have happened in the five years that fans of the SIMCITY series have been waiting and watching for the sequel to SIMCITY 2000. Things like less-than-stellar changes from SIMCITY 2000 to SIMCITY 3000 are superficial, but spending in-depth game time with the new game reveals that the improvements are significant. The graphic enhancements produce cities with more of a feeling of life-a change that can only truly be appreciated by going back and playing the older version. Suddenly you realize how much better this game looks and feels with its wider variety of buildings and with Sims going about their lives on foot or bicycle, or on the roads and highways. A plethora of animations bring the recreational and business aspects of your city to life, all combining to create a dynamic vibrancy that makes its predecessor feel as flat as two-day-old hot Pepsi. Likewise, the ability to create cities four times larger than before initially seems nice but trivial. However, it allows dramatically different city designs, with residential neighborhoods, farms, industrial zones, and commercial centers far more separated than before. (Accordingly, Sims are now willing to travel further than the next block to shop and work.)

They waste processing plant in your their name in CGW. There's been a lot of bewilderment about whether SIMCITY 3000 utilizes 3D hardware acceleration. The Internet newsgroups have been debatiing the issue, and there have even been reviews published that tout this as a feature. The confusion comes from several sources. First, back when Maxis was targeting a game with a first-person style of perspective, it was clear that a D3D and/or Glide API would be required to avoid an Apple II frame rate. Further muddying the waters is the fact that, if you have a 3D accelerator in your system, SIMCITY 3000 asks if you'd like to use it. Here's the truth, directly from Maxis: 3D hardware acceleration is not used. In fact, if you select your trusty 3Dfx Voodoo2 you will be rewarded with very slow performance. Why the video selection routine allows you to select 3D accelerators is pretty baffling; it's hard to come up with another non-3Daccelerated game that will allow this option. The bottom line: For the best performance you need to select your 2D video card. VITE www.computergarning.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. MAY 1999 167 "

"JEFF WAYNE'S THE WAR OF THE WORLDS REVIEW Wayne's World War Promising Alien Invasion Crippled by Brain-Dead Al STRATEGY WAR by Jim Cobb .G. Wells' classic War of the Worlds novel makes good points about technology and hubris, but the original storyline one side simply falls dead-makes for a lousy game. However, by excluding the book's Earth-saving microbes, JEFF WAYNE'S THE WAR OF THE WORLDS really spices up the action. What's more, this game (based on Wayne's 1978 musical, surely a first for a strategy game) captures the flavor of a Martian invasion of late-Victorian Britaina nice change.

After a promising start, however, things begin to fall apart. Flipping between multiple screens to construct defenses and facilities gets tedious quickly. Raiding with ships alone causes either the game to halt or the Martian side to unnecessarily destroy its own command post. Using units' special abilities tends to crash the game: worse, these abilities have no impact on the game in any case. There is no save system other than at the exit point. And while a bit of mystery is fine, you get so little information on units and resources that you are forced to learn by trial and error. The computer Al attacks in penny packets with no coherent tactical plan. As a result, the game becomes a cakewalk for you, albeit a drawn-out one. This makes all the subtleties of the strategic game, the cool differences between the two sides, and the dynamic campaign game almost meaningless. If WAR OF THE WORLDS offered a multiplayer system to provide some challenge, it would be worth your time. As it stands, it's a curiosity to be picked up months from now in the bargain bin-after GT Interactive patches the Al.

You never run out of the pieces you need to create large layouts or space to lay them out, and you can bring them to life with more animation than a motor and a few AA batteries can provide. You can save your creations without disassembling them, and cleanup is a snap if you do choose to take them apart. On the flip side, you don't have the pleasure of holding the pieces in your hands, snapping them together, or following simple, step-by-step instructions to create complex three-dimensional models, which is what Lego is really all about. LEGO LOCO plays to the strengths of the computer. More a miniature train set than a traditional Lego kit, the game asks you to lay out huge quantities of track, surround it with one-piece buildings and other landscape details, and finally send animated trains chug-chugging around. You pick the track sections, buildings, and shrubbery from a graphical menu tucked away inside unning a real model railroad (as opposed to the fake kind) takes intelligence, persistence, and guts. 3D RAILROAD MASTER lets you climb into the cab of a diesel or futuristic engine and, hopefully, find out if you have what it takes. Play consists of running one or more engines around one of the rail layouts, some of which are quite complex; dealing with cargo; and trying to meet a schedule. Falling behind schedule will cost you points, just as making scheduled stops earns them. The difficulty level affects, among other things, the complexity of the layout. The game includes 20 track designs, and for the most part they are open to modification. However, you are also referred to Abracadata's companion product, 3D RAILROAD CONCEPT AND DESIGN. This includes instructions for integrating other layouts or creating new ones, along with some sample missions. 3D RAILROAD MASTER has an unfinished and bugridden feel. Nearly every menu has text disappearing, missing buttons, and misaligned entries. The layouts are loaded in two steps, and this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to more than a minute. The game's problems might be tolerable if the program were in any way enjoyable. However, play quickly degenerates into tedium. Most annoying is the cargo interface, with far too many steps required in what should be the simplest process in the game. The program's lackluster graphics help complete a very bleak picture.

"WER'S EDGE STRATEGY  CHEATS WALKTHROUGHS Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Making the World Safe for Mind Worms and Diplomats Alike by Terry Coleman omatic Mission GAIANS MAGNANIMOUS rying to encapsulate the range of possible strategies in a game of SID MEIER'S ALPHA CENTAURI in a single article is like trying to discuss the collected works of Duke Ellington on one page. So consider this a starting point, and rest assured that we'll follow up with additional hints and tips in the months to follow. \"You mean a gift? I like gifts. What did you have in mind?\" THRESHOLD OF TRANSCENDENCE THRESHOLD OF TRANSCENDENCE EXPLORE 15 SECRETS OF CREATION Never mind THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING Just because a faction is already in your pocket doesn't mean that you should stop offering them gifts. Besides, she might be free Saturday night. TRANSCENDENT THOUGHT TEMPORAL MECHANICS Base Fateties The Voice of Planet The Ascent to Transcendence the sanctimonious bastards, anyway). My benefits from this included the following: FREE-FOR-ALL Once you build the Voice of Planet, everybody can build the Ascent to Transcendence and win the game. Why give up your edge? For my money, you're better off at least trying for a diplomatic victory first. 1. The Gaians sent me more than a dozen military units to help \"defend my borders\" against the Hive. SELECT-RESEARCH GOAL 2. I liberated a Gaian base and gave it back to the rightful owner. In return, Lady Deirdre gave me a captured Believer base on my border. Centauri Ecology EXPLORE Biogenetics DISCOVER 1 ou can ignore diplomacy in ALPHA CENTAURI, but you miss a lot of the game's flavor if you do. Plus, if you keep your reputation unsullied, you can gain a lot of favors later in the game. For example, I made a point in my last game in which I was playing the University faction) to ruthlessly secure my borders and to pla. cate everyone else. I first got Morgan on my side by using a Free Market economy (money talks) and then set up a trade agreement with him. The Techs I gained from Morgan helped me to crush Santiago's faction. Meanwhile, kept giving Tech gifts to the Gaians to keep them fairly neutral. As a result, when I changed over to Green economy, the Gaians, nearly rhapsodic over my environmental savvy and generally magnanimous nature, signed a Blood Pact with me. But I didn't stop there. I kept on giving gifts of Tech and Energy to keep the Gaians happy. When they needed help against the Hive and the Lord's Believers, I lustily sent my forces off to war (I never liked either of \"By studying the Xenofungus we can leam how to survive IL \"Understanding the numan genetic code\" 3. I managed to convince the Morganites to call off a vendetta against the Gaians, which freed up Gaian forces to concentrate on the Believers. Unit: Formers Terraforming Unit (E6) The Weather Paradigm Ecological Engineering Centaun Empalhy The Human Genome Project Recycling Tanks (Bonus Resources) Gene Solicing || Secrets of the Human Brain 4. The Gaians and I combined our research and lapped the Hive's Tech efforts, which was ultimately why I won the game. GREAT GALACTIC LIBRARY After you've played a few games, choose your own specific research path. You can never be too nice. In ALPHA CENTAURI, your former enemy may eventually turn out to be your best friendstrange bedfellows and all that (if this concept confuses you, just think of the French).

"I Got a Secret, Honey (That You Oughta know) The Living Refinery GAMERSED in CIVILIZATION || (Brian Reynolds' previous game), you eventually run out of Wonders of the World to build. Part of the reason for this is the decelerated turn structure, whereby each turn initially represents 50 years, then 20, then 10, and eventually gets to the point at which each turn equals only one year. So while you have the same number of Wonders in each era of history. there are proportionally fewer Wonders in the modern era per turns that you play. Reynolds wanted to have the design of ALPHA CENTAURI avoid a similar problem. You'll often find, especially on higher difficulty settines that all of the Secret Projects (Wonders of the Alien World) won't be built before someone wins or the game ends. This gives you a lot more freedom in choosing what Secret Projects both suit your style of play and fit in the specific game situation. Keeping that in mind, here are my recommendations for Secret Projects that work well regardless of what faction you play. 53 Why does this have to be three?\" Two words: game balance. As you move into the middle game, there is generally an explosion of new Tech discoveries, conveniently in time for you to reap the benefits without handing it to you on a silver platter. IS 1. The Weather Paradigm Terraform Rate +50 Percent This is an obvious choice for those who wish to \"walk with Planet,\" like the Gaians, and those who use a more balanced approach, like the University. But it's an even better choice for factions who don't give a mind worm's underside for the environment. If you are a militaristic leader, like Colonel Corazon Santiago, the ability to make major changes to your surroundings with this Secret-without having to discover the prerequisite technologies, helps you increase your energy supplies. Still, the Hive tends to benefit the most from the Weather Paradigm. Just drill a few boreholes into Planet's crust, raise a mountain to the skies, and pop a reflection mirror (surrounded by solar collectors) on top of it. But be ready for the inevitable mind worm rush from hell. 8. Neural Amplifier Psi Defense +50 percent Whether or not you choose to breed mind worms, these Secrets numbers 6, 7, and form an almost unbeatable combination against indigenous lifeforms. If you choose to breed life-forms, you can attack technologically superior forces on an even footing. For once, the science fiction actually, adds to gameplay rather than just providing color. 4. Cloning Vats Create Permanent State of Population Boom for All Bases Eliminate Power and Thought Control Negatives Even if, with Cloning Vats, a particular base grows larger than you can optimally handle, that will be balanced by the number of cities that stay incredibly productive. Plus, you can always combine this with... 9. Living Refinery > Decreases Minerals-Required to Support Military Units. Social Modifier +2 Even if you don't plan on winning militarily, this Secret lets you afford to garrison your cities adequately as well as keep a mobile force together in case trouble breaks out (and in ALPHA CENTAURI, it always will). Moreover, by this time in the game, the extra social engineering support can be a lifesaver. 2. Hunter-Seeker Algorithm Immunity to Probe Team Activity Tired of unwanted Probe Team activity? The new Hunter-Seeker Algorithm (brought to you by the same folks who invented the Planet Buster) has a lifetime guarantee to seek out, find, and eradicate all, and we mean all, enemy Probe Team activity-it even works with SID MEIER'S ALPHA CENTAURI version 2.0! Don't leave the excursion pod without it! 5. Telepathic Matrix Ensures That Drones Never Riot Probe Team Morale +2 Is your Nerve Staple Gun starting to wear out? Don't punch through any more tough drone skulls! With the new Telepathic Matrix, all your drones can be easily thought-controlled with the touch of a button. Best of all, this handy device frees you to do the work you should be doing, like becoming the dominant faction on Planet. Why wait? After all, you know what's best for drones-you're their leader. 6. Dream Twister Psi Attack +50 Percent 10. Universal Translator Grants Two Free Techs Upon Completion By this point in the game, regardless of what faction you are playing, it's a given that you are embroiled in a \"research war\" with at least one or two of your sworn enemies. The Universal Translator serves the same function that Darwin's Wonder did in CIV II, and it can put you over the top technologically. When you start this Secret Project, make sure that you allocate nothing to research-you'll get the next discovery free via the Secret-and use this time to maximize your economy and make your populace happy. 3. Planetary Datalinks Gains You Any Tech Already Discovered by Three Other Factions My first thought when deciding to build the Planetary Datalinks was, \"The Great Library in Civ Il gives you a Tech discovered by any two other factions. 7. Pholus Mutagen Grants All Human Units Alien Life-Form Advantages Reduces Negative Ecological Effects of Industry Gives Alien Life-Forms That You Breed +1 Life Cycle Bonus www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING "


": Got Dem Ol' Demon BoiBlues GAMER'S_EDGE and locusts of Chiron make for great interceptors, even against the latest high-tech aircraft. the attacker always has that edge in psi combat. Choppers are the best for this, because of their multiple attacks per turn. 5. Build the Dream Twister, Pholus Mutagen, and Neural Amplifier Secret Projects (see the \"I Got a Secret, Honey\" sidebar below). 2. Allying with the Gaians helps to keep mind worms off your back, as the Gaians tend to capture the beasties before they can hit your bases 6. Build a Centauri Preserve improvement at every base where you're building mind worms. It's generally a good idea to do this anyway for the ecological effects. 3. You should strive to discover the technology that will allow you to capture or control mind worms (which you already have if you are Gaian). Obviously, you can also trade for this ability. ver wonder why, no matter how much you pump up your defenses those nasty old mind worms just won't let you be? It's because mind worms and their brethren are supposed to be an alternative to the normal Tech tree-psi attacks are always based on 3:2 odds and morale, regardless of the usual technological modifiers. 1. When you get a chance to take out a wimpy or crippled enemy unit, let your mind worms do it. After a victorious combat, mind worms tend to advance in life cycle faster than standard units advance in morale/training levels under similar circumstances. When you get up to Demon Boil status (especially with some of the enhancements listed above), mind worms are just about the toughest attackers in the game. 4. Breed indigenous life-forms yourself. Mind worms are excellent for harassing enemy bases, Actually, it's easy to turn this to your advantage, provided that you approach the disgusting crea tures with an open mind. Here are some tactics that will help: 1. Make sure that you attack mind worms and their brethren before they attack you, because Let's Make a Deal which you are trying to elicit votes. Morgan likes energy, for example. Sinally, don't give up on a diplomatic victory. I tend to go for this, especially in games where it's obvious I'm going to eventually win anyway: It's a heckuva lot faster than grinding out a military win by conquering every last enemy base on the map. Here are a few ways to better your chances: 1. First, get yourself elected Planetary Governor, so that your vote counts double. If you can't manage this, how can you plan on becoming Supreme Leader? 2. Be realistic when assessing your chances Factions with a vendetta against you won't vote for you, even if you manage to get them to agree to a cessation of hostilities. 5. Keep in mind that a Planetary Council can be called only once every 20 turns, and you will not be warned of that crucial fact until after you've cut all your deals and mortgaged off your first-born. So don't get embarrassed, and be sure you pay attention to the number of turns since the last diplomatic action. 3. Allies will vote for you for Supreme Leader more often than not, despite their posturing, so don't waste a lot of Energy or Tech bribes on them. 6. If you fail to get yourself elected Supreme Leader, it adversely affects all factions' relationships toward yours. Of course, if you really want practically everyone gunning for you, this method offers a lot less hassle than building and launching a Planet Buster (though it's not nearly as fulfilling). 4. Match your bribes to the faction \"on the fence\" from Terry is a huge fan of Sid Meier's entire catalog of games. 180 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY www.computergaming.com "

"StarCraft: Brood War The Intergalactic War Heats Up With New Units and New Strategies by Elliott Chin s hard as it is to believe, STARCRAFT is now even better. The expansion pack, BROOD WAR, not only introduces six new units but also makes several changes to existing ones. The result is a better-balanced game and a wealth of new strategic options. The patch.txt file details all the specific changes and should be in your STARCRAFT directory. But we'll summarize the changes and the new units here. Zerg SPIKED The lurker's splash damage makes it a deadly antipersonnel weapon. Lurker Damage Type: Normal, splash-friendly Size: Medium Strengths: Can attack while burrowed; does splash damage powerful attack damage. Weaknesses: Vulnerable while above ground; slow to burrow: can't attack air. Lurkers morph from hydralisks and are available in the midlevel of the game. They attack while burrowed, which means that ene. mies need a detector in order to fight back. You should definitely use lurkers for base defense or to guard expansions while your hatchery is building. Enemies that fail to send detectors with their attack forces will be destroyed. The lurker attacks with a line of spikes, and all enemy targets in or around the path of the spikes will suffer damage. Lurkers are the perfect unit for ripping apart supply lines and weak infantry units like marines, firebats, and zerglings. Lurkers are vulnerable above ground and while burrowing (which takes two seconds), so be sure to escort them with hydralisks. Also, lurkers aren't good against long-ranged defenses (siege mode tanks, sunken colonies, or photon cannons) because they need to be close to be effective. An early lurker rush can destroy Terran and Protoss players if they have no detectors. EATEN ALIVE Use the devourer to greatest effect as support for mutalisks. Devourer Damage Type: Explosive + special Size: Large Strengths: Acid spores slow and weaken enemies, high amount of damage; high hit points, relatively cheap. Weaknesses: Very slow rate of attack, can't attack ground tar.. gets; can't take on units alone. attack by a mutalisk that hasn't been upgraded. A combination of devourers and mutalisks is extremely powerful because the negative armor bonus also applies to the mutalisks' secondary and tertiary attacks. Attach a group of six to nine devourers to your 12 mutalisks and you'll be able to tackle heavy ships like scouts, battlecruisers, and carriers. The devourers' high armor makes them well suited to take on corsairs and valkyries. Plus, they are relatively cheap because they don't require a lot of gas. Devourers should be used with mutalisks. Their attack does a base 25 damage, but it also releases acid spores that then splash onto the target and any nearby enemy units. Each spore reduces the target's rate of fire by 1/8 and its armor by 1. A unit can have a maximum of 9 spores on it at once. After a unit's armor has gone negative, each point below 0 translates into an extra point of damage accrued from an attack. A battlecruiser (with a base armor of 3) hit with 9 spores would thus suffer 15 damage from a follow-up New Units ONLINE For a complete BROOD WAR campaign walkthrough and detailed descriptions of all units and more strategies, check out the GameSpot BROOD WAR guide at www.gamespot.com/features/broodwar gg/index.html. See the Review APRIL ISSUE 5 STARS 186 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  MAY 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"Zerg Changes to Existing Zerg Units Spore Colony: Now deals normal damage; more effective versus scourges and mutalisks. Cheaper and faster to build. Sunken Colony: Cheaper and faster to build. Deals 40 explosive damage and attacks faster. Should now be built more often for defense. Larva and Hatcheries: Cheaper (300 mineral), but take longer to build. Larva production has slowed down significantly so you have to build second and third hatcheries much earlier to match the production speed of original STARCRAFT. Defiler: More expensive to produce, but it should remain a mainstay of your late-game arsenal. Scourge: Now have 25 hit points. A good counter to the corsair, the devourer, and the valkyrie. Hydralisk: Build time increased slightly. When coupled with the increased larva production time, this slightly slows down the creation of the hydralisk horde. Queen: Parasite cost increased, parasite range decreased, and broodling range increased. Beware of the new corsair and valkyrie. Ultralisk: Two new upgrades increase movement speed and bump up base armor from 1 to 3. Now is a more powerful siege weapon that is less vulnerable to small, swarming soldiers like zerglings and marines. Zergling: Adrenal gland upgrade results in an even faster attack, making them more useful in the late game and much more effective at overwhelming enemy forces. GAMER'S EDG Changes Terran GOT HEALTH? Stim your infantry before you enter combat and let the medics heal them. Medic Damage Type: N/A Size: Small Strengths: Heals infantry automatically and quickly: can restore units with negative conditions. Weaknesses: Has no attack; near useless optic flare ability. Your infantry needs medics to survive. The medic's rapid healing rate can greatly extend the lifespan of your firebats and marines. Only one medic can heal a unit at a time, though, so don't go overboard: Build one medic for every three infantry units. Stim-pack your infantry before combat, wait for medics to heal them to maximum hit points, and then rush in. When moving medics, right click on any infantry unit in your group and medics will follow him. If infantry stop to attack targets, medics will also stop to heal the injured. Medics heal infantry automatically, but they can be commanded to heal allied organic units like zealots and Zerg troops. Medics can also cast restoration and optic flare spells. Restoration: Alleviates all negative conditions except for stasis field and broodling. Cast this on any unit to rid it of parasite, plague, ensnare, irradiate, blindness, or lockdown. Optic Flare: Reduces the target's sight to 1 and eliminates cloak detection. Friendly units near the blinded individual will spot for it. Blinded spellcasters must get within modified sight range to cast a spell. Optic flare is nearly impractical, however, since any unit that can be blinded is better off dead. CRITICAL MASS Multiple valkyries with wraith support can do serious damage to clusters of enemy units. Valkyrie Damage Type: Explosive, splash-friendly Size: Large Strengths: Does splash damage in a large area; high hit points. Weaknesses: Expensive; slow rate of fire; offensive power negated by armor upgrades; needs supporting aircraft to finish job; only good in large numbers. Designed to support other ships against enemy flyers, valkyries fire eight missiles at a large area, dealing splash damage to all targets. Because they have a very slow rate of fire, you need other ships to finish off enemies. Each missile does 5 explosive damage, making valkyries vulnerable to scourges and less effective against mutalisks. They are good for hunting overlords Armor counts against each missile, so heavily armored enemies will shrug off the missiles. An upgraded mutalisk with 3 armor, for example, only suffers 1 damage per missile from an un-upgraded valkyrie. Valkyries are good in numbers, in a support role, and only when fully upgraded. A combination of battlecruisers and wraiths can prove cheaper and more useful. New Units www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1999 "


"Terran Changes to Existing Terran Units ER'S EDGE GAMER! ComSat: Scan now costs 50. With dark templars and lurkers, multiple comsats now a must. Missile Turret: No change, but new cloaked units necessitate building turrets earlier and more often. StarPort: Cheaper and builds faster, so you can get air units more quickly to counter mutalisk hordes. Nuclear Missile: Builds twice as fast, making nuclear strikes more viable. However, new cloaked units beget more cloak detectors, so be more cautious. Battlecruiser: Now starts the game with 3 armor. Yamato cannon now does 260 damage, so it can destroy a scout or a devourer in a single hit. Dropship: Builds a little faster and also moves faster. Firebat: Stim pack now doubles the attack rate of the firebat. Ideal versus zealots, upgraded zerglings, and dark templars. Goliath: New Charon Boost upgrade increases air attack range to 8, the same as a guardian's. Ground damage now 12 and air attack upgrade modifier improves from +2 to +4. Unequivocally the best antiair ground unit. Science Vessel: Cost altered to be less reliant on gas (100 mineral, 225 gas). Now accelerates faster and has larger sight radius, making it a better scout and detector. Irradiate now does 250 damage and deals damage faster. Science vessels now a necessity with the advent of dark templars and lurkers. Wraith:50 mineral cheaper and deals 20 air damage, although ground attack is now slower. Wraiths now more cost-effective as air-to-air fighters and should be built to complement valkyries. Changes BENEDICT CRUISER Use the dark archon's mind-control ability to counter enemy battlecruisers. Protoss Dark Archon Damage Type: N/A Size: Large Strengths: Can disable large groups of organic units; can mind-control any unit; can destroy most spellcasters with a single feedback attack. Weaknesses: Has no natural attack; easily killed; expensive to produce iloi Dark archons are costly to form and require much micromanagement. But their three abilities can be quite formidable. Feedback: This spell causes units with energy points to lose all energy and suffer a like amount of damage. Use it to eliminate cloaked wraiths, high templars, or ghosts, and to deplete the energy of queens, science vessels, and defilers before they can cast spells. Mind Control: This spell turns an enemy unit to your side. It depletes 150 energy and brings all shields down to 0. Mind control is perfect against battlecruisers, carriers, reavers, and ultralisks, and to capture valuable enemy spellcasters. Mind-control a worker and you can access that race's technology tree. You can then exceed your unit limit by building enemy warriors. You also gain spells or upgrades if you mind-control an enemy Protoss player's units.

"Protoss SILENT KNIGHT Go for the enemy's comsats and towers so that your dark templar can have free rein inside the enemy town. Dark Templar GAMERUS EDGE Damage Type: Normal Size: Small Strengths: Permanently cloaked; does massive damage per hit; faster than un-upgraded zealot. Weaknesses: Expensive; fewer hit points than a zealot; more vulnerable once detected; can't attack air. These permanently cloaked assassins can decimate a Terran or Protoss base in the early game. Because those races tend to have limited detection ability early on, just one or two dark templars can be sufficient to spell victory if you get them quickly enough. Their attack is slow, but the 40 damage they inflict more than makes up for their speed. When using dark templars, go for detection buildings first, such as missile turrets and comsats. Bring in a few zealots to distract enemy warriors for a more effective attack. If your enemy has ample cloak detection, start using the dark templars more strategically: Attack defenseless expansion bases and unprotected flanks of the enemy's main base. Dark templars also make good spies for watching resource nodes. New Units Protoss Changes to Existing Protoss Units Photon Cannon: Not only does it build faster, but forge is also cheaper. You can and should acquire cannons faster. Shield Battery: New range of 4 matrices and 100 starting energy make it more useful as a defense. Observatory: Cheaper now, so you should build observers as quickly as possible to deter the new cloaked units. Dragoon: Faster and cheaper to build. Range upgrade +2 instead of +1. Can be built quickly for air defense, and they get the drop on hydras, marines, and mutalisks. Archon: Now accelerate much faster, making them better offensive weapons. Great against ground and air. Beware the EMP shockwave, dark templars, and lurkers. Arbiter: Cheaper (100 mineral, 350 gas) and more practical. Scout: Shields and hit points increased to 100 and 150 respectively, air damage upped to 28, and ground attack slowed. Star gate is cheaper and builds faster, so you can get scouts quicker. Carrier: Reduced cost, increased base armor, and more powerful interceptors (40 hit points, 40 shield, 6 damage) make this a more viable war machine. Increased capacity upgrade builds faster and is cheaper. Still loses against battlecruisers, however. Reaver and Shuttle: Both build times increased slightly. Build times for robotics facility and robotics support bay also tweaked so that you can no longer get to reaver drop as quickly as before. Reavers still available at same time for base defense, however. All transports now require that offloaded troops wait before they attack, thus reavers can no longer fire immediately upon disembarking.

"Thief: The Dark Project Better Breaking and Entering for Budding Burglars by Lance A. Larka ye lad, so you want to be a Keeper, eh? A small weight on the great balance of the universe? Are you sure that you aren't disturbing my rest solely to become a liberator of wealth? Yes, young Garret, I know your past. I too was once tempted, but stayed the course. You shall too-if you survive, that is. You listen close now. I'm only gonna say this once, and it's your arse locked in Cragscleft prison if you don't listen. Your first consideration for any mission is what you are going to lug with you. You might find some items during your mission, but don't count on it, so choose wisely before you start. Pay close attention to your briefing, oftentimes there will be some clue to what you'll be facing and what you'll need. Be sure to spend all your cash at the beginning of every mission. Money doesn't carry over from mission to mission. Likewise, don't be afraid to use all your equipment since you lose it after completing the mission. MONSTER MASH Hate dodging the undead? Love the smell of rotten flesh? Lure zombies to a small area and take advantage of the splash effect of holy water arrows to take them down with minimal effort. NO MUSS, NO FUSS hoot guards when they're standing on carpet. When you move the body, the carpeting will absorb the blood, covering your tracks and saving you a water arrow as well. Tools of the Trade Let's start with the broadhead arrow. This basic killing tool works on humans, animals, and the Trickster's minions. Don't waste time shooting these at undead though-they'll eat you alive for your trouble. Use a water arrow with holy water instead. Non-blessed water arrows are the only way to douse torches and fires, and to wash away incriminating bloodstains. Speaking of holy water, you can get it from a special blessed vial or from a blessed fount. Either way you have only 30 seconds before its potency expires or you'll be left with a wet zombie instead of scattered body parts. Happily, the water's splash effect lets you damage multiple targets if they are close enough. That reminds me! If you're trying to truly \"spread the wealth\" amongst a group of undead, toss a flash bomb at them. If you aim one of these bombs properly, you can hit several closely clustered foes. This is especially useful against the faster spirits. You can also use a flash bomb to temporarily blind a foe, so that you can have a few seconds to run or to kill them. Nothing has armor everywhere (although the Burricks come close). Before firing an arrow, take time to find the sweet spot. For humans, the unguarded neck or lower back is a prime place to aim. Hit zombies in the chest so your arrows don't pass through them. If you can, make your first shot a surprise; you do five times as much damage when their guard is down.

"GAMER'S EDG Bait and Switch One way to distract your foes is to fire a noisemaker arrow past them. If you're good, you can use one of these to get a group of foes to cluster together and then finish them off en masse with a gas arrow, or herd them toward a preplaced mine. You don't necessarily need a noisemaker arrow to distract a foe. Throwing items such as cups, boxes, and other objects will work in a pinch. Likewise, the sound of an arrow hitting the wall next to a guard will probably alert him and make him move. Fire Arrows are my personal favorite even though they really light up your position. These little gems are great for making a group of foes into Burrick fodder when they stand together. Don't waste 'em if you can help it-if you run into one of the \"cursed\" creatures without any holy water, one of these will send the creature to eternal sleep.

But as for the choice of plane, I'd take a MiG-29 over an F-16 any day of the week. Although the shortrange missiles on both aircraft have an 11km range, the MiG has a considerably longer reach with its 148km R-77 Adder than the F-16 has with its 48km AMRAAM (curiously, the game counts the Adder as a medium-range missile in multiplayer games). This allows for the jet combat equivalent of sniping from a safe distance. It also forces your opponent to turn away from the missile, so you can work your way behind him. When the action gets up close and personal, the MiG is ultimately more maneuverable at moderate speeds than the F-16. In an F-16, you can afford to lean on the afterburner while you turn (the F-16's larger fuel tanks come in handy here). In a MiG, ease back on the throttle in a turning fight.

"HALL OF FAME GETTYSBURG WELCOME TO THE COOPERSTOWN OF COMPUTER GAMES. These are the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. Alone in the Dark (1-Motion, 1992) Hall of Fame-New Inductees The Bard's Tale (EA, 1985) Battleground Series (TalonSoft, 1995-present) Battle Chess (Interplay, 1988) CGW, we rarely induct an entire series into the Hall of Fame, but the BATTLE GROUND series is an exception. With each new release, TalonSoft regularly upBetrayal at Krondor (Dynamix, 1993) graded the older titles in the series. As a result, the BATTLEGROUND series represents the best American Civil War gaming and Napoleonic era gaming Chessmaster (Software Toolworks, 1986) ever on the computer. The graphics and interface brought miniatures and hex-based wargamers to the same maps for satisfying battles. The soundtracks and film clips Command & Conquer added additional color and historical depth to an already satisfying game experience. (Virgin/Westwood, 1995) Throughout the entire series, the play balance was near perfect. The transparent handling of bookkeeping chores for morale, troop quality, line-of-sight, and fatigue made every battle reflect the military realities of the Day of the Tentacle (LucasArts, 1993) period without slavish historical replication. If, after a time, you became overly familiar with a particular battle. field, clever \"What if?\" scenarios added new challenges. Smaller scenarios broke huge battles into easily DOOM (id Software, 1993) playable chunks (which were great when employing the easiest play-by-email system we've ever seen), and there have been plenty of opponents available to play via challenge ladders on the Web (such as the excellent Dungeon Master (FTL Software, 1987) www.leadeaters.com/battleground/sc-bgwchateau.htm). In short, TalonSoft's series offers all of the possibilities for glory with none of the horrors of war. Earl Weaver Baseball (EA, 1986) Empire (Interstel, 1978) RIDEA Tomb Raider (Eidos, 1996) you wouldn't think that an action game as \"spelunking simulation\" would be so F-19 Stealth Fighter (MicroProse, 1988) popular. But from the moment it hit the market, TOMB RAIDER was destined for greatness. It had a beautiful 3D engine, enormous well-designed levels, moody Falcon 3.0 (Spectrum HoloByte, 1991) atmosphere, and great sound. Best of all, it featured a girl a girl with big guns, both literally and figuratively. Front Page Sports Football Pro Lara Croft, Tomb Raider's spunky heroine, became a household name overnight. Time Digital ranked Lara 47th (Dynamix, 1993) on its 1997 list of the \"cyberelite,\" while the British government adopted her as a mascot. The explosion of Gettysburg: The Turning Point Lara merchandising included comic books, music CDs, action toy figures, an oft-rumored feature film, and even (SSI, 1986) a tour with rock group U2. Some gamers shied away because of all the hype, and it certainly didn't help that TOMB RAIDER I was a letdown. What got ignored was the game itself. Gunship (MicroProse, 1986) And what a game TOMB RAIDER was! What you initially thought was a gimmick quickly caught you up in a sort of addictive, sublime simplicity. It was hard to resist moving this incredibly athletic polygonal female through Harpoon (360 Pacific, 1989) exotic locales, all the while dodging poisonous darts, solving room-sized puzzles, and filling jaguars and dinosaurs full of lead.

"Chairman of the Bored In Which One Editor Stares Into the Postholiday Void—and Whines Or like: Why-given my age and given the fact that even by the most lowbrow junior-high standards it barely registers as \"humor\"-do I feel compelled to try to work in a joke about the product on my desk called \"My Interactive Pooh\"? You see what I've been reduced to? Pooh jokes. Some body give me something to do. alone would be enough to bum me out and make me reconsider my father's advice to become a real-estate appraiser, but to get all three in one day? Who do look like here? Job? Oh, yeah, there was one more title today. ELITE DARTS. A computer darts game. Not to overstate this or anything, but let me just say, with no offense to the people who made this game, that the day I feel compelled to play darts on my computer is the day I'm going to don green neon tights and a cape and swan dive from the top of this building. he dog days of gaming are upon us. Now that the major gaming companies have shipped all their high-profile holiday games-whether they were finished at the time or not-we are officially in a \"down time. This down time will last from now until around December 15, at which time 8,000 new titles will once again flood the market, 7,990 of which will be duck hunting games. Around the Computer Gaming World office, you can tell that boredom has set in. With a dearth of good titles to write about, our brains atrophy by the minute, as professionalism steadily devolves into simianlike, Lord of the Flies barbarism. Nerf footballs are thrown over cubicle walls. Loud belching has replaced meaningful dialogue. Action Editor Robert Coffeywhose past is still a mystery to us-growls and performs scary rituals with Vaseline and what appear to be human bones (not all that different from what he does the rest of the year). For my part, I find myself gazing out the window, drifting off on all sorts of useless meanderings. Like: How many times must our new candy machine reject my brand-new, perfectly crisp dollar bills before I am morally entitled to grab the nearest brick, crowbar, or intern, ram it into that infuriating hunk of crap, and take all the candy I've been so cruelly denied the past few weeks? RETURN TO KRONDOR practically all on the same day? These games sound alike, the boxes all look alike, and they all appeal to the same crowd. They all appeal to me, but being faced with all three at once, as I am now, is just too overwhelming-sol don't want to play any of them. I'd rather belch at my desk and play Cow HUNTER. Memo to the bean counters: Gamers play games every day, all year long. We crave decent titles, are willing to pay a lot of money for them, and will play them incessantly, whenever you put it out—if you do a good job. So break the mold. Live large. Take a chance. Stop being a lemming. Be the gaming sensation of spring, rather than just another also-ran in December. You'll III Look, I'm not a marketing expert, and I haven't exactly compiled any research (because that would require actual effort, JEFF GREEN whose past is still a mystery to The day I feel compelled to play darts on my computer is the day I'm going to don green neon tights and a cape and swan an dive from the top of this building. make a lot of bored gamers very very happy, and you may just help the editors of Computer Gaming World find their way back to the proper path of civility and decency again. B-R-R-R-A-A-A-A-P!!!!! CGW III Our only hope, on a daily basis, is the mail delivery. Every day, when the cart rolls by, the editors huddle around like apes before a monolith, clutching at packages with somber, nervous desperation, hoping that some unexpected gem has arrived. But inevitably, these days, it's just more dreck. Here's what I received today: COW HUNTER, DEER AVENGER, and BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD'S BUNGHOLE IN ONE. Now, any one of these games and that's not in my job description), but doesn't it stand to rea son that, like a good movie, book, or CD, a good game is going to find its audience no matter when it's released? And doesn't it also stand to reason that releasing your game at the peak of the holiday season is a surefire way to have your title get completely lost in the glut? I mean, how dumb was it for Sierra to release KING'S QUEST: MASK OF ETERNITY, QUEST FOR GLORY V: DRAGON FIRE, and What Jeff doesn't realize is that the human bones that Robert Coffey is playing with belong to the last columnist to make fun of him in print.
