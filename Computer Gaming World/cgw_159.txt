Most of his critics hit upon his racial heritage as a cause of bias, thereby proving his point. Others claimed he had no sense of humor. Yet, what they didn't hear was his point that the game would have been better without the cultural denigration. ing experience if the designers had bothered to get it right. Racial slurs aside, both SHADOW WARRIOR and DEATHLORDS could have educated, stimulated, and entertained more effectively if they had paid attention to true Asian culture. Yes, they're just games. But they could have been good games! (See the Letters col umn for more on this controversy.) I recently had a similar experi ence when I mentioned my pacifist political leanings in the CG-ROM Welcome Letter. I was told that was a hypocrite. I don't think so. I like to play wargames because they are analytical history. They teach lessons of geography, leadership, resource management, and strategy. I like to see what went ( ome people don't think that editors and game reviewers should ever write about any. thing except the computer games themselves. Others think that we should merely talk about the way the game plays and never comment on particular artistic techniques, design decisions, or technological innovations. Such people either have tunnel vision or live in a world of denial, insisting that neither art, fiction, movies, nor games affect the way we view our selves and view life. Yet, art forms do affect the way we view life. Just as Impressionists : rejected \"realistic\" painting and tried to show something new about light and color, so can games force us to see life in a new light. They can be a catharsis, as we reject what we don't like about life and exult in a Dionysian feast of near-unlimited power and resources; a cultural corrective, as we view fictional actions from another perspective and decide to reject the bogus perspective; or they can be inspiring, as they raise our consciousness about something that we have overlooked. They may even cause us to do fur ther research. But, of course, they can also be irrelevant As I write this editorial, Elliott Chin has received virtual tons of flaming emails because of his stand on the racial slurs and slop SHADOW wrong or right and try to figure out experientially why a given battle came out the way it did. Sometimes, my pacifist leanings are affirmed as I realize the stupidi ty of a particular move. Sometimes, I shake my head in Wonder at the sacrifices paid for the freedom I enjoy. Frankly, don't think it's wrong for me to share my insights from time to time, even if you don't agree with them. Our hobby would be a meaningless place if we didn't hold up the games to the real world from time to time and see how they stack up WARRIOR and DEATHLORDS are just games. But they could have been good games! This isn't the first time CGW has castigated a game publisher for tapping Oriental source material to develop a cheap knock-off of a successful game system. Scorpia, who is not of Asian her. itage, insisted that Electronic Arts' DEATHLORDS was a cheap rip-off of ULTIMA, with only a thin veneer of Orientalia to cover its tracks. She insisted that the Eastern cultures would have provided a richer gamTOTALLY UNCOOL Elliott Chin's editorial about racism in 3D Realms' SHADOW WARRIOR (this coolie hat-wearing zombie is a good example) ruffled some feathers.

"LETTERS HOT LAN LETTER OF THE MONTH DEEP THOUGHTS I've been one of those typical types who has been reading your magazine since the mid-'80s. Many games and systems have come and gone from my desk ever since, but I guess it's just now that I've got some \"Food for thought\" questions that have been bugging me... 1. Do you notice how the majority of five-star rated games in your magazine are either wargames or sims? I don't think even those gems in the sand like DIABLO and RED ALERT rated five stars. Sure this is a generalization but... 2. Do you notice how you can tell a highly anticipated game has missed its mark by the distinct silence by the masses (PRIVATEER 2 and quite possibly, X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER) in contrast to the shield banging that preceded its release? 3. I'm sure some will start hammering Elliott Chin's article on SHADOW WARRIOR, but the man does have a point. One of your competitors, in response to a \"Why are there no AfricanAmerican heros in PC games» pointed (quite seriously) to the character of «Superfly Johnson\" in ION Storm's upcoming game DAIKATANA as some kind of consolation. Superfly Johnson? I had to shake my head at that one... and yep, you guessed it, I'm an African American (and a computer security specialist who's never been called \"Superfly,\" or \"Shaft\" for that matter.... Although I hear that Shaft is a bad mutha.) These aren't necessarily critiques of your magazine, mind you, just some pseudointellectual musings from a dedicated reader. Chris Marin via the Internet SHADOW HORROR When I read Elliott Chin's article 3D Realms' [August] on my favorite game, Folly SHADOW WARRIOR, I was outraged and in disbelief; the first thing that came to mind was hypocrisy! I love this game. It is the heir to DUKE3D and I look at it as a game that has a cool sense of humor like DUKE did. My friends and I laughed lysterically at how it was racist. No, Elliott, you missed the point; it is in a Jackie Chan type of chop-socky humor. If this is racist, so is DUKE because he is a womanizer. But that is okay because he is white. How come you don't complain about Lara Croft in TOMB RAIDER being stereotyped, or REDNECK RAMPACE. No, that isn't racist. I think Lo Wang is a great character and I would love to be him. I think that 3D Realms is doing their job because they thrive on controversy. You started to even knock PREY for having a Native American hero. I think it is great that 3D Realms is even having a hero from this great culture! And I bet you didn't see the screenshots or the story and how it is the most advanced game ever. Well, Elliott, better bite your tongue because the full SHADOW WARRIOR will have more fun and controversy. James R Horning via the Internet 1. We rate only between 15-20 games with five-star ratings each year. Sometimes, sims and wargames get the edge because there are real-world measurements by which to judge them. Also, we factor difficulty levels into the ratings and may be more lenient on the graphics or interface of a more difficult game that we know will appeal to the hard-core, even if it might not appeal to the masses. For the record, DIABLO was given a 4.5-star rating, even though we eventually picked it as Game of the Year, because it was too short and the role-playing elements weren't that deep. Since it was positioned as an RPG by its advertising, we had to be tougher than we normally would. Also, we had to compare RED ALERT with its award-winning predecessor. Did it advance the state of the art? Some of the staff said \"yes\" while others said \"no!\"We settled for 4.5 stars. 2. That silence explains why it's our policy to wait to review a game until we have a final copy. You can't know until you play the code as it is tested and play-balanced. Anything else is merely an educated guess-a guess that can be wrong. 3. With regard to Shaft, \"Shut yo'mouth.\" Well, you are talking about Shaft. You're right. See the letters under \"Shadow Horror\" in Johnny Wilson's editorial this month. Elliott Chin's article blasted SHADOW WARRIOR for what he felt was an inaccurate portrayal of Asian culture, and for failing to adhere strictly to the historical fact of the ninja of Ancient Japan. Beyond that, the column positively damned 3D Realms for blatant insensitivity to the camaging effects the racial stereotypes in the game might have upon its audience. Mr. Chin expressed repeatedly the offense he took at 3D Realms\"ignorance and disregard for real Asian culture. \"Mr. Chin requests that SHADOW WARRIOR be the last 3D Realis game to obtain its cheap laughs\" at the expense of a minority. I, on the other hand, would prefer that Mr. Chin's article be the last in CGWto assume that its readers look to 3D action shooters as a primary source of cultural education. How can he expect anyone with the intelligence to install a recent computer game to sit down to a session of SHADOW WARRIOR with the same degree of intellectual involvement as one might devote to, say, RAMA? Mr. Chin's comments fail to persuade on two separate counts. Firstly, his \"ignorance and disregard\" for my own capacity for critical thought. Secondly, because he has fallen My friends and I laughed hysterically at how [Shadow Warrior) was racist.\" CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

"The Computer lint Marine LETTERS world that anything and everything is fair game, there is little such men can do to regulate us. Once we start qualifying our own freedom, we are in trouble. Fred Snyder via the Intemet face first into the saddest trap of political correctness-a complete lack of humor. The major criticism made against SHADOW WARRIOR is that, when attempting to create an authentic ninja adventure, 3D Realms merely caricaturized the subject matter. It is a caricature, as much as DUKE NUKEM 3D was a caricature of action films. Unfortunately, I cannot look upon Mr. Chin's comments as any sort of objective review because, I'm sorry, he's Asian. Perhaps I would have respected the article more if he had come to the rescue of our downtrodden Midwestern brothers so rudely affronted in REDNECK RAMPAGE. What was it Voltaire said?«I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" Just don't say it about me, eh Mr. Chin? If I seek cultural education, I'll see Farewell My Concubine again. If I want to play an ultraviolent computer game, I will do so without regard for any bruised egos on the part of those who might associate themselves with the games subject matter. Such an association is purely their own invention. If Mr. Chin wishes, he always has the right to avoid ever playing that game or any game ever again. (If he ever does exercise that right, I'd like his job.) The last thing I would cxpect from 3D Realms is edutainment. The last thing! would expect from a magazine that has always championed complete freedom in game design-a magazine that adopted a cavalier attitude toward the depiction of women in DUKE 3D-is a diatribe on the industrys confusion about the differences between China and Japan. Perhaps DUKE 3D was even more offensive, but the new ness and innovation of the Build engine made it all forgivable. Now that the engine is showing some age, the tolerance for questionable subject matter choices has fallen. But such behavior is hypocrisy, and if you as the media and we as the audience begin to permit such behavior, we must realize that it weakens our resistance to the likes of Senator Lieberman. If we insist I was about to write a letter to CCW when the August issue arrived in my mailbox and I saw that Elliott Chin had already spoken up for me. The first time I saw the SHADOW WARRIOR ad, I was extremely disgusted. Not just by the violence, but by the making fun of Asian culture. Worse of all the yin-yang symbol has been defaced with blood splattering out of one \"hole.\" And nothing spoiled my day even more than secing it on the front page of my favorite magazine. I know that CGWin the past has had certain criteria for ads appearing in its magazine (first the X-rated, then the violent kind of ads). Maybe this should be extended to racist ads as well? All in all, SHADOW WARRIOR will not be getting my (and this half of the worlds) support. 3D Realms' reputation has also fallen in my regard as a sadistic company that abuses others for laughs. And, yes, fortune cookies do not exist here, they were probably created by Americans.

Rick Ong Singapore After reading Elliott Chin's editorial on the offensiveness of SHADOW WARRIOR, I was curious to hear what people are saying on the Apogee forum on AOL. Being Asian, I too was offended by the portrayals in SHADOW W ARRIOR. I thought Mr. Chin's comments were right on the mark. Anyway, I found a few comments on the Apogee forum that pertained to the CGWeditorial. Most are just snide remarks about Mr. Chin and blew off his comments. However, I found a response by Mr George Broussard of Apogee on the editorial dated July 2, 1997. He wrote: toriai CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

I then posted a message on the Apogee forum with my comments and invited Mr. Broussard to defeat\" Mr. Chin's points. I hoped for a reply but I was surprised to see my post removed from the board on the following day! Is this the way Apogee and Mr. Broussard respond to criticisms from Asian-American gamers? Willis Huang via the Internet on the other hand, have the most exposure of any group in America. The heroes in nearly all computer games, not to mention movies and TV shows, are white. Believe me, if there were more Hiro Miyamotos and Asian heroes in games, I wouldn't complain so vociferously about SHADOW WARRIOR. Also, decades of Asian stereotypes and discrimination in the media simply make SHADOW WARRIOR's stereotypes seem gratuitous and insensitive, as opposed to REDNECK'S humorous caricatures of whites, who have never suffered any form of discrimination in this country. R ednecks were never taken from their homes and forced into concentration camps for no reason other than the color of their skin, as JapaneseAmericans were. Nor have they ever had their homes and properly confiscated. Unlike Chinese-Americans, Rednecks were never pressed into service to build the more treacherous western half of the American transcontinental railroad. Rednecks were never denied education, job opportunities, or homes because of their skin color, as all Asian-Americans were before a few decades ago. And Rednecks were never considered second-class citizens by law, as all Asian-Americans used to be. I would like to thank everyone who responded, because you showed me that I was correct in writing a column on SHADOW WARRIOR's stereotypes.

The hostile reactions suggest that many gamers do not think of the larger consequences and messages of the games they play. Elliott Chin responds: Tunderstand that the point of SHADOW WARRIOR is to have and make fun with Asian stereotypes, but it's only fummy for those non-Asians who don't care to put themselves in an Asian American's shoes 3D Realms says it created all the stereotypes on purpose, choosing to create an outrageous parody of old «chopsocky\" movies. But using coolies and fortunc cookies goes too far. Coolies were actually slaves, captured and coerced into servitude; you wouldn't create a game with black slaves, so coolics should likewise be off-limits. Yes, Lara Croft's proportions do smack of scxism, but as for REDNECK RAMPAGE, that's a little different. If you are the Asian community and have zero visibility in the media, you can hardly afford to have your only exposure be one of ridicule and stereotypes.

"READ.ME Edited by Charlotte Panther (CPanther@zd.com) Feel The Force LucasArts Adds Another Star Wars Title to Its Fall Lineup or the past year we've been waiting to play a Jedi or an Emperor in LucasArts' JEDI KNIGHT or REBELLION, respectively, but it looks like the next Star Wars game to hit the PC desktop won't be either of them. SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE PC, a game that unfolds between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, is set to arrive this fall. Though the release dates for LucasArts games have always been tenuous, SHADOWS PC could come out on schedule because of one important fact: The game's been done for a year. SHADOWS PC is actually a port of the successful SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE game that LucasArts developed for Nintendo's N64 launch. The game received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success. Now that Nintendo's one-year exclusive on the title has expired, LucasArts is ready to release SHADOWS for PC fans who just can't get enough of the Force. One important note, though: You will need a 3D accelerator to play this game. SHADOWS had amaz. ing graphics on the Nintendo 64, and in order to maintain that same level of visual quality, a 3D card will be required for PC Play. SHADOWS PC is the story of a mercenary named Dash Rendar, who stumbles headlong into a turf war between the Emperor's two main pit bulls-Darth Vadar and Prince Xizor (Xizor is the leader of the Empire's most powerful crime syndicate, Black Sun). As Dash, you help the Rebels fight against the Empire, play bodyguard to Luke Skywalker, and assume a key role in the penultimate battle between Vadar, Xizor, and the Rebel Alliance. Gameplay in SHADOWS is incredibly varied. In the first level (which is possibly the most fun) you pilot a Continued on pg 46 snowspeeder on the arctic planet The Hoth Planet Short takes on games and hardware released just prior to press time. THIS JUST IN JANE'S COMBAT STICK An updated version of the F-16 Combat Stick, this flight controller sports some mechanical fine-tuning as well as a bundled copy of the full DOS version of JANE's ATF. With two four-way view hats, six buttons, Xand Yaxis trim adjustments, and an analog throttle, Jane's Combat Stick by itself provides all the options many gamers need. The stick features a larg. er base than its F-16 prede. cessor. One limitation of the Combat Stick series has been its use of chorded button to get extra functions-multiple buttons couldn't be read simultane. ously. The Jane's stick, however, adds a switch that allows any combination of simultaneous button presses when attached to a CH Pro Throttle. The stick isn't programmable by itself, but is when used in combina: tion with the Pro Throttle. -Denny Alkin CH Products, (800) 624-5804 PC Flight Controller Reader Service #: 301 FORMULAI If you liked WIPEOUT, you'll probably like FORMULA 1.

The game takes place in a dark, futur istic world where the dominant cultural Poe forces--religion and science-preach their respective forms of salvation. Poe plays rock diva and pop culture queen Mary Magdelene, who has been transformed into the evil Plague, one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. With the help of Willis, your virtual wingman and sidekick, you'll seek out and destroy Plague and the other Horsemen of the Apocalypse, thus saving the world.-Charlotte Panther >>> SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.) and Headland Digital Media, Inc. announced that they are working together on an online gaming venture.

Gameplay focuses on exploring various symbolic worlds and uncovering musical loops. Gabriel's music is the real highlight here, but there isn't enough of it to draw the disparate art projects, by a selection of visual artists, together. Unlike simi: lar products from true performance artists like Laurie Anderson and The Residents, Eve just doesn't add up to a compelling, unique whole.

"READ.ME 3D Iron Works SHUOM NOJO MDRECTX esearching this edition of the Works took me to Seattle for Microsoft's big DirectX Love-In, known as Meltdown. This bi-annual event is a chance for hardware guys and software guys to get together and see if they can all just get along. As a new ver. sion of DirectX nears rev. 1.0, hardware guys bring their wares, while they're still working on drivers, and software guys bring their DirectX titles under development and try run ning them on the different hardware platforms. The idea is to kill bugs dead before games or drivers hit store shelves. The Microsoft hardware guys consist mostly of system and graphics chip and board makers, so naturally it is a primo opportunity to do some snooping around and see what's shakin! Among the graphics guys, the usual suspects were holding forth on the chip side: 3Dfx, Rendition, Matrox, S3, ATI, Number 9, et al. But the chip that seemed to be the conference darling was NVIDIA's Riva 128, a newcomer to the scene whose 2D and 3D performance will make it a very tough competitor this fall. The Riva 128 is featured on boards from both Diamond and STB, and 4MB boards will most likely hit the streets for under $200. We'll be looking at both boards in next month's 3D graphics roundup. Rendition was testing their V2200 part and, just for grins, waited until developers noticed how much faster their games ran to tell them it was the V2200, not the first generation V1000. We'll be putting a V2200 reference board through its paces next month as well. But the real shocker had to be Matrox's decision to do a PowerVR-based board, which should be shipping soon after you read this. Check out our review this issue of VideoLogic's Apocalypse 3Dx which also uses PowerVR. It looks like Matrox's part will be 3D-only, though coupling it with Matrox's Mystique would make for a pretty dynamic duo.

The SHADOW Wars arcade game is a substandard GALAXIANS/GALAGA knockoff, but without the gameplay of those early '80s classics.

"READ.ME Deadly Diva QUAKE 2's Babe Will Have Brains, Beauty, Brawn, and Balls f you've been following the development of QUAKE 2, you're sure to have noticed a foxy, red-headed, long-legged honey strutting (and jiggling) her stuff across id's Web site. But if you think you're going to run into this leather-clad, BFG-wielding bombshell when you play QUAKE 2, think again. The character currently up on the Web site is QUAKE 2 artist Paul Steed's homage to the allfemale QUAKE clan, CrackWhore. Steed is quick to state that he created this highly-characterized cartoon-like vixen just for fun, and she will not be the female-player character in QUAKE 2. However, one of the monsters will be a Borg-like version of CrackWhore. Instead of that glorious mane of red hair, she'll have cables running through her body and protruding out of her scalp. Although the real Q2-babe is in the early stages of development right now, Steed has a clear idea of what he wants her to look like. For one thing, she won't be running around half naked. Steed wants this character to be taken seriously, and despite what other developers seem to think, a female wearing three strategically placed triangles as her only battle armor is hardly realistic. Steed's femme fatale will be based on Private Vasquez, the super. tough marine from the movie Aliens, and will be dressed in similar attire--a sleeveless vest and full length pants. That's not to say she won't be feminine. This tough-girl will definitely boast womanly curves, but according to Steed, we can expect her proportions to be more realistic than those of the women we've seen in games so far. \"She'll be Artist Paul male or female (the Steed's homage to female character may the female QUAKE even have a pony-tail can, Crack Whore to make iden tification easier). You'll also be able to tell which weapon they're carry i ng, and if they're wearing armor.

As you approach a character in a DeathMatch, for example, you'll clearly be able to distinguish if they're Chicke With Beemsticke ere's a look at some of the female characters we've seen and some we can expect to see over the next few months. Finally, more designers are realizing that a woman doesn't have to be naked to be sexy. If the DEATHTRAP DUNGEON women are anything to go by, it seems that Eidos still has a lot to learn. Nonetheless, we did hear that Lara Croft will be wrapping up in a jacket during certain parts of TOMB RAIDER 2, and we'll also see her donning a wet-suit (see picture). Nikki and Amy from SegaSoft's VIGILANCE appear to be pretty tough cookies (despite the bare midriff factor). But if we had to choose one character to play, it would be DIABLO's Rogue. This babe gets tougher and tougher as the game progresses, and instead of tak 5w ing her clothes off, she piles the armor on. Now that's refreshing.

"PREVIEWS AGE OF EMPIRES Target Release Date: November 1997 Developer: Ensemble Publisher: Microsoft It's About Time Realtime Takes a Leap Forward With Microsoft's Civ-style Strategy Game by Elliott Chin ritics often charge that real-time strategy games have no depth; that victory in an RTS comes down to who clicks fastest. I've always thought it comes down to who thinks fastest, a truth that probably hurts for all those who fail in real-time wargaming. However, when it comes to the depth of current real-time games, there is some truth to the notion that what we've been playing so far isn't as rich or complex as turn-based legends like MASTER taking real-time games to a new level of sophis.

You can play as one of twelve and his codesigners at Ensemble Studios are ancient civilizations as you vie for supremacy, battling it out in frantic WARCRAFT-like ferocity or advanc. ing through economy and production, as in CIVILIZATION. The game has an isometric look to it and gorgeously ren dered graphics that are similar to Civ II's, though sharper and more colorful.

The controls are very much like those for WARCRAFT II, as AGE uses a right-click interface for issuing commands. However, like many of the real-time games under development, it offers more flexible user commands, such as saving groups (like in COMMAND & CONQUER), having hot keys for buildings and commands, and issuing way points for unit movement. DAN AGE OF DISCOVERY liken Age to CIVILIZATION because of its emphasis on discovery and research. Unlike many real-time games, AGE OF EMPIRES requires you to advance your civilization through various ages of discovery. You begin in the Stone Age, but can move on to the Tool, the Bronze, and, finally, the Iron Age. Each age offers a new collection of structures to build, weapons and instruments to acquire, technologies to research, and units to train. To advance to a succeeding age, your civiliza. tion needs to be well established in your current age, with a surplus of food and an econo. my to support the transition to a new era of growth.

I wasn't able to play against final Al, so I can't comment on how intelligent your troops or the enemy civilization will be in the final version. Ensemble says, though, that your own units will be intelligent enough to look for food and wood on their own if you leave them alone. If the Al is smarter than the usual paltry fare we get in typical real-time games, and if the Internet play is seamless and smooth over Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone, then AGE OF THE GREAT MARCH In addition to ideal multiplay, EMPIRES could secure a coveted spot on both Age will have a good single-player component as the traditional strategy gamer's and real-time well, including four well-done campaigns. fanatic's must-play list. The Resource Game GE OF EMPIRES, like most real-time strategy games, has several resources for you to harvest. The great thing about Age, unlike the rest of the real-time pack, is that these resources make absolute sense. You're not looking for a fictional ore or water or energy source. This is the dawn of civilization, and the resources you have to gather are the same ones that early man had to acquire: food, wood, stone, and gold. In the first age, you hunt and forage, but if you advance to an age beyond stone, you will gain the ability to build farms, which are a self-replenishing food supply. I thought this dynamic (of hunting and foraging, then learning self-sufficiency) was brilliant, because it created the sense that you were following in the footsteps of early man The food is LABOR FORCE The logically, used villager is your for \"building\" civilization's backbone, new units. whether he's hunting or The other farming for food... resources are wood, which you need to harvest in abundance for buildings in the Stone and Tool chopping wood...

"PREVIEWS DEFIANCE Target Release Date: October 1997 Developer: Visceral Productions Publisher: Avalon Hill Game Company Defiant Departure Avalon Hill's Next Game Will Surprise Longtime Fans by Thierry Nguyen 35 35 35 45 LIFT SHIELO HULL 100 90 100 46 valon Hill has a long back ground in making both boardgames and hard-core wargames. Mentioning the company's name conjures up titles like WOODEN SHIPS & IRON MEN, ACHTUNG: SPITFIRE, OVER THE REICH, and CAVEWARS. SO what will gamers think when they hear the name DEFIANCE? Is it a hard-core strategy game that entails playing a rebellious state or power? Well, die-hard strategy gamers will be surprised to know that DEFIANCE is not the title of Avalon Hill's next strategy game, it's the title of their next action game. Action fans, take notice. that will revolutionize the way combat 00 235 35 35 is carried out. Sure enough, you're having fun blowing away drones in your LAV-6 Saber gunship, when the base suddenly comes under attack. As you battle hostile biomechanical creatures, you realize that you are probably the only survivor on the base. Now, the plot could easily end there. Go play with the new toy, kill the aliens, win the game. But Visceral wants to meld the action MOON SHOT These biomechanical creatures will be your main enemies in DEFIANCE. PLOT? WHERE? DEFIANCE is the first game from the new action division of Avalon Hill: Visceral Productions. It's an attempt to merge the action of DESCENT with the storyline of WING COMMANDER. The game starts with you being called to a secret military research center. On arrival, you are told to test a new type of craft voice-overs and cut-scenes, you learn about a scientist who was working on biomechanical weapons and suffered a funding cut. Is this tale of a scientist-gone postal the cause of the massive attack? Or is there more? DESCENT INTO DEFIANCE In terms of actual gameplay, DEFIANCE is a lot like DESCENT. You'll pilot a ship around 3D levels and blast all sorts of enemies. Unlike DESCENT, your ship doesn't naturally defy gravity, so you will have to use your lifts and maneuvering jets in order to access areas higher than you. The version I played had only four guns, four types of missiles, and one level, but Visceral promises a greater variety of weapons and at least 13 large levels featuring areas such as canyons and cities. The graphics of the game look decent, but Visceral says the engine is still in development, and that they plan to have MMX and 3D card support. Whether they go for Direct3D or cardspecific support is still up in the air, but as it stands, the beta I played looked only slightly better than DESCENT II. Hopefully the art for the other levels and the added support will make the game look more contemporary. So, did Avalon Hill's sudden shift in game development help? That can't be judged until the game ships, but for now, it looks to be a good first entry. If they manage to pull off adding a good story to go along with the decent action, they could have a solid game on their hands. And maybe Avalon Hill will be known for both turn-based hex-filled patience and real-time 3D frenzies. LEVEL-HEADED It's hoped that Visceral will include their level editor when DEFIANCE is released, as extensibility would dramatically enhance the game's replay value. CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

Once you get aimed at giving the down to the ugly business of war, you discover wires back to hard that things are quite different. In typical real. core strategy types-without making them go time gaming, base building is a means to unit through the social gymnastics required to keep production.

Instead of producing units per se, battle each other using floating islands as their these structures function automatically in both operational bases. offensive and defensive mode and have to be deployed across the skies in almost chesslike fashion in order to engage and destroy your oppo nents.

"PREVIEWS BROKEN SWORD: THE SMOKING MIRROR Target Release Date: Fall 1997 Developer: Revolution Software Ltd. Publisher: Virgin Interactive Smoke and Mirrors Revolution's New Adventure Has Some Tricks up Its Sleeve by Thierry Nguyen Tezcallipoca, a vengeful Mayan god who will bring about the apocalypse predicted in Mayan folklore. irgin was one of the few compa. nies in recent memory to release a traditional graphic adventure in a market dominated by MysT alikes and full-motion-video filler. Revolution's CIRCLE OF BLOOD (known as BROKEN SWORD: SHADOW OF THE TEMPLARS in the UK) not only had gorgeous animation and background art, but it also possessed a tight and intriguing story that was filled with irony and historical/mythological accuracy. BROKEN SWORD: THE SMOKING MIRROR, the next episode in the series, promises an equally compelling story underneath a refined interface. MEANWHILE... Many elements of the game have been fine tuned. Graphic backgrounds are multilayered, giv. ing scenes more visual depth. The amount of dia logue has been halved (while still maintaining the strong story), addressing the criticism that the previous game was entirely too \"talkative.\" Nico is much more involved in this game. The previous game cast her in a filler role, in which she provided some information, but didn't do much else. Here, not only do you need her help in some of the puzzles, but you actually get to play her character. At certain points in the game, you'll switch between playing George and playing Nico. What's interesting is that Nico ends up embarking on the more dangerous quest, while George looks for pirates in the Caribbean, a nice change from the tired \"guy does macho, danger-filled quest while girl does thinking quest\" motif. Look for more danger and less mindless click ing when solving puzzles in this game. Cecil explained that the team grew tried of the \"try every inventory object on every item\" type of puzzle, and while puzzles like that exist still, they aren't the focus of the game. Some puzzles are dangerous, in that they require quick thinking in a limited time span, which can result in either victory or death. Virgin's next foray into graphic adventure looks quite promising. CIRCLE OF BLOOD was already an excellent game, and BROKEN SWORD: THE SMOKING MIRROR looks as if it will be one of the better traditional adventure games this year. JE SUIS UN WIMP Characters such as exboyfriend André Lobineau (at far right) retum for a second go at adventure. NOT JUST A SEQUEL Project Director Charles Cecil insists that the game isn't a mere sequel that just rehashes the old engine and characters but, rather, a new episode that retains certain characters while improving numerous design elements. The inter face has been tweaked (many of the icons are now consolidated into one universal icon, similar to what LucasArts did in THE DIG) and the overall graphic quality of the game is improved. While the new graphic effects such as translucency, shadows, and lighting will need a fast machine with the latest DirectX drivers, the engine will scale itself appropriately in play, so you can still play the game using DirectX 2.0 with 8MB of RAM. In this episode, familiar characters such as George, Nico, and various supporting cast members (such as André Lobineau and the gendarme in the café in Montfaucon) return, and you'll find the same attention to historical detail and mythic lore. The focus of the first game was the Knights Templar; this time it's the Mayan Indian culture, The plot has George and Nico running around locales like Paris, Marseilles, Quaramonte (a fictional South American city), and the Caribbean in order to find artifacts that will prevent the return of FULL MOON TONIGHT The background art this time is even more stunning than in CIRCLE OF BLOOD, with multiple layers that give a better sense of depth and space.

"PREVIEWS NFL LEGENDS '98 Famous Teams Featured in NFL LEGENDS '98 this system lacks the infinite versatility of ABC MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, it works well in practice: How many different audibles are you going to call from a given formation, anyway? Finally, taking a cue from Sierra's venerable FRONT PAGE SPORTS line, NFL LEGENDS '98 sup ports multiple camera angles. You can spin or rotate the camera, adjust the zoom levels and even the tilt-all with a handful of hot keys. Steelers' defense? Can Troy Aikman's conti dence hold up after being intercepted by Dick \"Night Train\" Lane? Will Barry Sanders frustrate defenders from the fifties just as he does those of the modern era? How well will Bob Griese's famed \"computer brain\" be able to decipher modern defenses with their cornucopia of zone blitzes? Just imagine the numbers that Otto Graham could put up passing from the Run and-Shoot offense.... When you match up teams from different eras, a key consideration is deciding in which era to play. A pampered quarterback from the '90s, for example, won't do you much good on a '30s roster, since you are allowed only 20 players on your entire team and playing both sides of the ball is mandatory. Still, certain modern players, such as the Bills' lightning quick defensive end Bruce Smith, are so talent ed that they would likely thrive even in the days of Knute Rockne. Whomever you decide to coach, the main limit is your imagination; it's as if you have the entire Pro Football Hall of Fame on your desktop. 1968 Green Bay Packers Mere months removed from their second consecutive Super Bowl win, the mighty Packers are a team at a crossroads. The nucleus of the team, including Hall-of-Famers Bart Starr, Carroll Dale, and Paul Hornung, is past its prime. Can you find the right mix of veterans and rookies to do what even coach Vince Lombardi couldn't-win a third consecutive Super Bowl? 1968 Miami Dolphins This young, talented group would become the only undefeated team in NFL history in 1972 The quintessential ball-control team, led by Bob Griese's passing and the running of Mercury Morris and Larry Csonka, the Dolphins scored the most and gave up the fewest points in the league two years running. Think you can beat Don Shula's timetable for an AFC dynasty by four years? Better work on that No-name Defense. 1950 Los Angeles Rams Formerly the Cleveland Rams (what is it with teams leaving that locality?), this team found tremendous success on the West Coast, with attendance figures of more than 80,000 per game. Here you have not one, but two Hall-of-Fame quarterbacks, Bob Waterfield and Norm van Brocklin, throwing to Crazy Legs Hirsch and Tom Fears. This is one of the great aerial attacks in football history. 1968 Kansas City Chiefs After having the best record in the AFL during the regular season, the Chiefs lost in the '68 playoffs, only to win the Super Bowl the following year. From QB Len Dawson and linebacker THAT CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON Right now, the season-long simulation aspects of LEGENDS are at least equal to its competitors. The preseason draft, for example, is tailored to the era in which you are playing. In a big departure from earlier football games, you can trade players for future draft picks, which makes multiseason leagues really competitive. Because the statistical base is really integrated into the game design, season-ending stats have the right feel: In LEGENDS, you don't have superhuman scoring, as opposed to say, NBA Live, where even poor teams routinely score 120 points in a regulation game. It's hard to imagine who wouldn't enjoy NFL LEGENDS '98. Both console and PC gamers alike will enjoy the blend of fast action and gritty grid. iron feel. Those who wish to play LEGENDS just for its realistic aspects will appreciate the coach-only mode, already a cut above recent editions of FPS: FOOTBALL. In addition to robust solo play, you can suit up your players for gridiron wars against another human coach via modem, serial connection, LAN, or TCP/IP. Fresh and fulfilling, LEGENDS is one of those rare game designs that transcends its genre. This promises to be not just one of the best sports games of the year, but one of the best games of the year overall. BLITZ WITH A BUTTON The interface is tailor-made for a gamepad. If you are using a Gravis pad, your receivers are color-coded according to whether they are the primary, secondary, or tertiary receiver in the pass pattern-an elegant way to simulate the quarterback \"checking off\" each receiver. Accolade plans to support Direct Input and daisy-chaining for Microsoft gamepads as well. Calling audibles at the line of scrimmage is similarly easy, as you can designate up to four different offensive and defensive plays. While Willie Lanier to long-range kicker Jan Stenrud, this was not just the best of the old AFL teams, but one of the best ever in pro football. 1932 Chicago Bears This team is to pro football what Babe Ruth's Yankees were to baseball, with almost too many stars to count: Red Grange, Bronko Nagurski, Beattie Feathers (the first documented 1,000-yard rusher)--the list goes on and on. What's really scary is that these guys performed at such a superlative level while playing both offense and defense. Can you imagine Dan Marino or Emmitt Smith doing that today? 1950 New York Giants For the entire decade of the fifties, New York had only one losing season and played in three championship games. One of the alltime great running teams, lead by all-purpose back Frank Gifford, the Giants match up better versus modern teams than you might think. And MANES their uniforms haven't changed much in a halfcentury, either. CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

It is a game that turns the WING COMMANDER Uni. verse on its Arcturian ear, and in the process, completely reinvents the space simulator genre. Big Bang Redux Lead designer Billy Cain, like the rest of the PROPHECY team, was respectful of Chris Roberts accomplishments, but felt it was time for a fresh start. \"My background is in action games,\" Cain says. \"I cut my teeth on consoles. WING COMMANDER was the first game that I really thought just rocked on the computer. When I look back at WING COMMANDER II, for instance, there was this really cool plotline-a cinematic feel even with the limited technology they had back thenbut all the missions were great in and of them. selves. What we wanted to do was to take the ideals of WING COMMANDER I and II and combine that with the cinematics and technology from Wing III and IV.\" So, the design team took \"Gameplay is number one\" as their mantra and designed all of the space flight missions first. They then sat down with the director and producer to hammer out a script to be filmed that would reflect the gameplay-almost the exact opposite of how WING IV was designed. And, mindful that they have left some gamers behind the C U MIC NOT NOT JUST SPACE DUST Asteroids are back with a vengeance in Prophecytechnology curve in earlier II and they look even more threatening when viewed with 3D accelerator cards. and the WING COMMANDERS, PROPHECY's design team is trying hard to offer a shading and textures.

"COVER STORY \"By losing the multiple-choice responses and going to a specific cinematic where what you see is based on how well you perform in the game, we've achieved a certain clarity.\" -Adam Foshko, Movie Director INSIDE THE INNER SANCTUM Director Adam Foshko (left) and Lead Designer Billy Cain work in the PROPHECY War Room. Villains, Knock Off All That Evil! WING COMMANDER IV suffered from, among other things, a lack of good vil lains. Thus, the time would seem ripe for a comeback by those bad kitties we all love to hate, the Kilrathi. And indeed, it appears that they are poised to return with a vengeance. The Confederation has issued warnings of a fully decked-out Kilrathi battle armada, ready to sail. But on your arrival you discov er that the Kilrathi were brutally declawed; the fleet has been destroyed, and all you find are lifeless hulks drifting in space. Obviously, whatever took out a fully primed Kilrathi invasion fleet-leav. ing no casualties of its own-is something that seriously compromises Confederation security. The game thus begins to unfold in the manner of a taut mystery, as you gather intelligence about your alien foe. What you find (without giving away too many secrets) is a race so terrible that it makes the Kilrathi look like household pets. The design team went to a lot of trouble making the aliens look totally different from any race yet portrayed in the WING COMMANDER Universe, even eliciting the aid of Syd Mead (of Blade Runner fame) as a consultant. The end result is a rich, organic look for the alien shipssort of a Babylon 5-meets-SPACE MARINES motif. The design involves more than eye candy, however. Owing to their organic design, the alien vessels have special capabilities. Imagine the surprise of a Confederation pilot when the three small alien vessels approaching his squadron suddenly combine into one craft-especially when the newly formed vessel has more firepower than its three constituent parts! If that isn't enough, try piloting over one of the alien capital ships. These behemoths require that you take out a ship's systems one at a time--no more launching a single point-blank torpedo and flying back for the medal ceremony. As a result, you might be required to fly multiple missions to take out one capital ship. The sheer volume of these vessels-some over three kilomeMORE LIGHTS, MORE SOUND, MORE ACTION Even in this early state, PROPHECY shows a lot of improvements over WING IV. Check out the pivoting engines on the Confederation Vampire (top), the opening octopus arms on the secret Alien vessel (center), and the clean \"no cockpit\" HUD and multicolored explosion (bottom). And with the Dolby Pro Logic Surround sound, in space they can hear you scream-from any angle. CGW OCTOBER 1997 "


"ters long has to be seen to be A WING COMMANDER Retrospective ters long-has to be seen to be believed. It takes a long time just to fly past one of these monsters. In com parison, the Star Wars Death Star would look like a PT boat in the wake of a battleship hris Roberts' dream was to recreate the scintillating combat scenes from movies like Star Wars on the computer screen. When those plans fell through, Roberts came up with The War Against the Kilrathi, a grand struggle truly worthy of an epic trilogy. The WING COMMANDER series began with With each new chapter in the WinG COMMANDER saga, the story became more important. The writers, led by science-fiction author Ellen Guon, explored such themes as the fine line between heroes and traitors, the effects of a long, drawn-out war, and how the winners always write the final history. By the time of Wing COMMANDER III: HEART OF THE TIGER, these universal themes were given a big budget, and filmed as though they were a full-length motion picture. Three years later, Wing III is starting to show its age: The Kilrathi often look like angry Muppets, and a few of the bigname actors were visibly uneasy with the interactive format. Even so, Wing III is more than a museum piece, because it was the first-and still is the best example of that strange hybrid, the interactive movie. The Minimalist Approach Certain WING COMMANDER tactics have been changed for PROPHECY. You won't have to jump back to the rear and side turrets on your torpedo bomber, because the Al takes care of all that now. A lot of your choice as to which fighter to fly has been taken away. This is a step backward, but according to Billy Cain, it's a step back to better gameplay: \"It's the Wing I paradigm. If we know what ship you and your wingman) are in, we can design the mission to take advantage of that. Our goal is to make every mission unique, as alive and vibrant as we can.\" Likewise, your ability to choose your wingmen has been curtailed. If you chose to always fly with Maniac, for example, and you had a pivotal scene with another character, you wouldn't have any investment in that character (simply because you would never have gotten around to flying with him). The result would be a flat scene, some thing the PROPHECY team is determined to avoid. They have a point: If you think back, the defining moments of the Wing COMMANDERS have generally occurred when losing a companion, such as when Spirit sacrificed herself in WING II. It's also justifiable from a gameplay standpoint; since you no longer portray Colonel Blair, you wouldn't have the authority to make personnel decisions. So, in this new chapter of WING COMMANDER, you become Casey, the latest hotshot Confed pilot; it's almost like starting back at WING I. Any lingering feeling of deja vu is limited, however, by the fact that bitmapped vessels that look creaky indeed when matched up against the sleek vessels of later space flight games. Even so, gamers braved the MCGAgraphics galaxies in their jaggedly polygonal craft to take on increasingly ferocious feline foes, simply because there wasn't any game remotely like WC. And just as the Confederation scientists added new technological marvels in the game, so did Origin continue to push the hot hardware of the day. The series hyperjumped to true VGA graphics, then SVGA graphics, and simply by putting wingman voiceovers in the cockpit, made Sound Blaster into the default technology for \"subspace communications\" in the gaming universe. 'WING COMMANDER IV: THE PRICE OF FREEDOM is a cinematic extension of Wing III. It's essentially a galactic docudrama, featuring seven CDs packed with fullmotion video. The acting is much more assured than that of WING III, featuring fine performances by Tom Wilson (Maniac) and Mark Hamill (Blair) among others. But while the story itself is quite engagingparticularly when exploring the dynamic relationship between war hero Colonel Blair and his mentor, Admiral Tolwyn-FREEDOM lacks the visceral punch of Roberts' earlier work, as the gameplay takes a definite backseat to the film. When you consider that a very good game such as Wing IV is considered a setback, however minor, it shows just how high expectations are for the next installment. Our bet is that WING COMMANDER: PROPHECY does such a good job of blending gameplay and cinematics that it will shine as one of the brightest in the Wing COMMANDER Canon. Yet Chris Roberts' greatest legacy wasn't an array of technical achievements. The secret of Wing COMMANDER's success is that it was the first actionoriented PC game to involve us with the characters. From the \"hot washup\" scenes in the bar of the Tiger's Claw during WING COMMANDER, to the elaborately staged film clips of WING COMMANDER IV, the cut-scenes were truly cinematic (and a welcome break from wrist-wracking action). The designers made sure that we knew why Vagabond was obsessed with playing cards, or how honor was more than a word to Spirit. As a result, your wingmen felt like characters in an RPG, rather than just another few lines of Al code. OCTOBER 1997 CGW "

"COVER 'STORY \"'The most fun I've had with WING COMMANDER was bringing my CGW acting award [for WING III] to rehearsal for WING IV. At first, Mark Hamill thought I made it up-then he asked why he didn't win one.\" Tom \"Maniac\" Wilson H Colonel Blair (once again played by Mark Hamill) is still around. If you can get over the fact that in a previous existence, you were Col. Blair, you'll have fun being virtually young againalthough you do have to show the proper hero worship to Blair Some of the rest of the old gang are still around as well, most notably Tom Wilson, who never gets enough lines as Maniac. (While Origin/EA has no official comment, it's obvious that everyone concerned would love to do the long rumored \"Maniac Missions\" for WING COMMANDER. It's mainly a matter of time and money.) Ginger Lynn Allen reprises her role as Rachael, after a hiatus dur ing Wing IV. In a nice touch, she gets to actually act this time, instead of just raising the blood pressure of every male pilot on the carrier. I'll let you decide whether PROPHECY is more or less dramatically effective than its predecessors. But I will say that I was particularly impressed with the performances director Adam Foshko elicited from his actors, especially since most of them had never even played a computer game before. We'll see how well those performances translate into the final product. The Best Elements of Each The missions themselves are a cornucopia of classic WING COMMANDER themes, except that there will be special multiplayer missions for Internet play. The ever-present branching tree is more dynamic than before. Missions now have degrees of success or failure, which give more variety for both the in flight and movie sequences. In addition to the torpedo runs on larger craft, you have both small and medium dogfights, which may occur anywhere: The OOZING ALIEN HORDES Three alien ships move to combine into a larger vessel for attack (top left). Above, a damaged alien seems to almost bleed blue into a nearby planet's atmosphere. From the asymmetric spines of the Porcupine to the sleek and deadly Manta (left), each alien ship displays a unique and eerie organic quality. CGW OCTOBER 1997 "


"WING COMMANDER Goes DVD designers of PROPHECY are big fans of Wing II, in which you often had to scramble to protect the carrier from surprise attacks, so expect to see those kinds of elements in PROPHECY as well. Then there are escort missions, which are designed to be difficult, as in the SECRET MIssions disks, plus a few covert operations that we can't tell you about just yet. Finally, it is possible that asteroids-a staple of WING I and II-will make it back into the lineup for PROPHECY What you won't find during the missions are the same old audio and video cues, such as Maniac's annoyingly repetitive dialogue every time you told him to attack in Wing IV. The new engine allows for Dolby Pro Logic sound, which, if you have the right audio equipment, provides dynamic sounds for every object in the environment. Thus, if you are in a battle and an enemy vessel is slightly to the left and behind you, that's where you'll hear it. The constant buzz of radio chatter, zooming ships, and explosions adds tremendously to your perception of the battlefield. Another big change is in the cinematic sequences. Generally, these happen between missions, but without the interactive \"multiple choice\" responses of WING III or IV. What now happens is very much as in WING II, where the movie clip you see is dependent on what you do in the flight combat sequences. Director Adam Foshko feels that this approach gives the linear portions of the game more punch, since you aren't playing \"20 questions\" in every scene. In the end, what's most impressive about PROPHECY is not just the technology, even though the 3D engine beats anything on the market (even without an accelerator card). Neither is it that the movies are more tightly focused, or that the missions are better designed. It's that the team took chances rather than repeat a bestselling formula. They completely dissected what has made WING COMMANDER the best gaming series to date, kept the best parts, and discarded the rest. The fact that PROPHECY will cost much less than Wing I will doubtless make EA very happy. The fact that this could be the best WING COMMANDER ever in terms of gameplay will doubtless make a lot of gamers very happy as well.

"Role-Playing Get imes have been tough lately for computer role-playing games. Once the proudest of warriors in all of computer gaming, RPGs came sputtering into the mid-'90s like a group of gasping, wheezing old menriddled with dated engines, hackneyed stories, and flaccid gameplay. While we watched the rest of the industry flourish, magazines such as this one and gamers everywhere began to openly wonder: Is the RPG genre finally on its last legs? he answer, we're now happy to report, is a resounding no-not by a longshot! You see, a funny thing happened on the way to the old-age home: The RPG managed, somehow, to inject itself with a fresh dose of health and mana, and it's beginning to radiate with life again. Now, as we approach the end of 1997, role playing games are poised to make a triumphant return to the center of gaming. What accounts for this great reversal of fortune? We credit three things. First, the genre is finally catching up with gaming's technological advances of the past few years. RPGs have notoriously long development times, and only now are we beginning to see RPGs featuring things like fast 3D engines, high-resolution color, multiplay, and stereophonic sound. Second, now that gamers have feasted upon such graphically stunning games as QUAKE, they're hungering for something a little meatier. You see it happening in the action genre itself, where a number of upcoming titles are beefing themselves up with RPG-style characters and story elements. Instead of being a pariah, the RPG has suddenly become something to emulate. Third, there's the little matter of a game called DIABLO. Yes, Blizzard's megahit boiled the RPG down to its most basic element-dungeon hack-andslashing-but it did it with such style and addictive gameplay that its value as entertainment was impossible to ignore. (Even the grande dame of role. playing herself, our own Scorpia, recently admitted to the editors how much fun she had with DIABLO.) We can argue endlessly-as the Usenet threads will verify-over whether DIABLO was a \"real\" RPG, but why bother? Just be glad that it made RPGs cool again for gamers. Thanks to this one game, you suddenly have thousands of new gamers who are familiar with concepts such as armor and weapon class, and experience points-and who are now ready for CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

"Get Medieval On Your PC Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven New World Computing's Fabled Franchise Returns for More RPG Magic our long years have passed since DARKSIDE OF XEEN, New World Computing's previous entry in its landmark MIGHT AND Magic role-playing series, and for those of us who love the series, it has seemed like an eternity. For New World Computing, though, those years were anything but quiet, as the company shifted its focus to create two of the greatest strategy games of the past decadeHEROES OF MIGHT AND Magic I and II. And given the phenomenal success of those games, it's hard to argue with the company's plan. Now series creator and New World president Jon Van Caneghem is turning his atten. tion back to role-playing with a new game due this November -MIGHT AND MAGIC VI: THE MANDATE OF HEAVEN. Those familiar with the previous games, however, should not expect more of the same. Van Caneghem and his team are pushing the series forward techno. logically to create a MIGHT AND MAGIC unlike anything you've seen yet. Along the way, you'll participate in dozens of nonlinear sidequests and learn more about the Ancients' struggle--the uberstory behind the whole MIGHT AND Magic series. What's more, New World tells us you'll be preparing yourself for HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC III, which the company says will weave into the M&M VI storyline. (HEROES III is as yet unannounced-so calm down for now.) MIGHT & MAGIC VI Face Lift New World has completely revamped the character creHAIL MARY M&M VI provides you with an endless siege of mon ation and spell systems for M&M VI.

"Get Medieval On Your PC The biggest news, for some fans, will be the addition of real-time combat-which will coexist with the game's traditional turn-based model. Why did New World go this way? According to Van Caneghem, it's because of the new engine's capability for smooth-scrolling move. ment. \"It didn't make sense to force turn-based movement, hence turn-based combat, on the player,\" he says. \"We're giving gamers the option to play in either mode, whichever best suits their style of play.\" In keeping with the real-time model, New World stresses that M&M VI will be a living, changing world as you play. Events won't always be triggered by your actions, and the game's dozens of NPCs will often follow their own agen: das through the world. In addition, locations will not remain static as you continue to play. For example, if you hack and slash a group of monsters in a forest and then move on, you might come back later to find it reinhabited by another group of monsters. OTO HELLO DOWN THERE M&M Vi features a smooth-scrolling 3D engine that will let you move in all directions, including, at times, straight up into the air. Graphically, M&M Vi represents a quantum leap over the previous games, with a brandnew 3D engine that will provide smoothscrolling (as opposed to tile-based scrolling), 360-degree movement throughout the fantasy world. The world itself is a vivid hi-res, 3D environment (though New World promises that a 3D accelerator won't be needed to play the game). Red Eye Fans of New World's MIGHT AND MAGIC games (both the strategy and RPG titles) know that the company always manages to infuse the series with that mysterious X factor-that addictive ingredient that makes you play the game night after night until your eyes hurt. Based on what we've seen so far of MIGHT AND MAGIC VI, you may want to start catching up on your sleep now. They just may have done it again. -Jeff Green TRAIN IN VAIN You'll be able to get buff at the game's various training grounds, as long as you have the experi. ence points to pay. Jon Van Caneghem: The Hero of MIGHT AND MAGIC on Van Caneghem has headed the MIGHT AND MAGIC franchise ever since MIGHT AND MAGIC / in 1986 (his first computer game), which he designed and programmed almost entirely by himsell. Van Caneghem was gracious enough to take a break from the hectic schedule of the new game to answer a few questions. CGW: As someone who has been developing compul er RPGs for more than a decade, you've seen the genre's popularity ebb and flow. For the past few years, everybody has been saying that the genre was near dead, but now it seems to be on the rise again. Any theories as to why it's making a comeback? Van Caneghiem: Rumors of the death of CRPGs have been greatly exaggerated! The product development cycles of CRPGs are typically much longer than that of the standard run 'n gun games that have been so popu lar in recent years. With the hardware advancing at such a staggering rate, it just didn't make sense-financially for most companies to invest resources into the genre. However, the gaming audience is looking for products with more \"meat\" in them now, a hunger that 3D shoot. ers and pseudo-RPGs can't satisfy. CGW: Have you played any of the newer RPGs, like DIABLO and DAGGERFALL? If so, what do you think of them? Van Caneghem: Yes, I have. Both give a pretty good gaming experience for what they are. However, DiABLO IS an action game disguised as an RPG, and DAGGERFALI, S a fine RPG saddled with 1994 technology. CGW: What other games are you into these days? Van Ganeghem: Lately I've been fiddling with DUNGEON KEEPER and BETRAYAL IN ANTARA, but my time is really dedicated to MIGHT AND MAGIC VI development. CGW: In the beginning, you did all the work yoursell. How much of MIGHT AND MAGIC VI are you directly involved in? Van Caneghem: I'm still involved in virtually all aspects of game development. There's everything from designing the interface, maps, and quests to oversee. ing and directing the artwork, storyline, and overall look and feel of the game. The buck stops here. CGW: Do you still enjoy getting your hands dirty with development, design, and coding? Van Caneghem: Yes! That's where the fun of this job is. OCTOBER 1997 CGW "

"Get Medieval On Your PC Return to Krondor Raymond Feist Makes a Triumphant Return in the Long-Awaited sequel n 1993, Sierra On-Line released BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, the first RPG based on Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar saga. It subsequently went on to win both CGW's Premier Award for CRPG of the Year and a place in the Hall of Fame, mainly due to the fact that Feist actually helped in the writing and design of the game. Subsequently, though, there was a fallout between Feist and Sierra On-line, and Feist moved his services over to 7th Level, while Sierra continued work with their own RPG based on the KRONDOR engine, the recently released BETRAYAL IN ANTARA. Now, after a couple years of work, Feist and 7th Level are preparing to release RETURN TO KRONDOR, the true sequel to BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR. Dig It RETURN TO KRONDOR takes place about a year after BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR. Prince Arutha still rules over the city of Krondor, Pug is still the master Magician at Stardock, and James, though now a Seigneur, is still up to his roguish activities. This time though, the game doesn't start with a mere \"escort service\" plot setup, as in BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR. Instead, we begin with a treasure hunt. RETURN TO KRONDOR DA BIG BEAR This ugly mug belongs to Bear, arch-nemesis and leader of the mercenary pirates hired by Sidi to capture the Tear of the Gods. RETURN TO KRONDOR is the long-awaited sequel to BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, the acclaimed RPG set in author Raymond Ferst's fantasy world of Midkemia. Target Release Date: First Quarter 1998 Developer: 7th Level Publisher: 7th Level www.7thlevel.com A priceless artifact, the Tear of the Gods, is lost at sea. It was being transported by members of the Temple of Ishap (the prime god in Midkemia) when they were attacked by pirates working for a mad sorcerer named Sidi who, for reasons unknown, wants the relic. Unfortunately, the ship containing the Tear accidentally sunk, leaving the Tear at the bottom of the sea. The initial, overall quest is to simply find a way to recov. er the Tear from the ocean floor. But in the process of recovering the Tear, the player charact ers are drawn into a massive, three-way conflict for the Tear, and end up fighting an evil that may even be older than the gods of Midkemia (the Valheru perhaps?). This time, you'll be playing five characters, of whom only one was from the previous game. Of the characters we've seen in the books, you'll be portraying James (one of the more popular characters in Riftwar), and William, the KnightMarshal of Krondor and son of Pug the Magician. The three other player characters will OCTOBER 1997 "


"Get Medieval On Your PC Riftwar Reading Rainbow be new ones made for the game: Jazhara, the Keshian sorceress (from an exotic, Middle Eastern-style empire): Solon, warrior-priest broth. er of the Temple of Ishap; and Kendaric, a reluc tant Midkemian wizard. The game is separated into 10 chapters with an overall goal. As in the previous game, each chapter has one main \"quest\" you must fulfill in order to move the story along, but you are free to do just about anything you want until you finish that main quest. Within these chapters, while different party members come and go, none will leave permanently, unlike in BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR. A Whole New World Since Sierra retains the rights to the original BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR engine, 7th Level went ahead and created a new one for its game. Rather than go with the first-person perspective in the first game, they went completely thirdperson. And if their ideas for this engine actual. ly come through, it will be immensely better than its predecessor. When traveling large distances around the game world, the overview map is used, but when the player reaches a specific place of interest, it switches to the third-person view where you navi gate the area with the cursor. Combat is still turn-based, and is seamlessly integrated into the game's action. Instead of walking down a street and seeing the words \"you encounter a gang of thieves,\" you'll actual ly see the thieves approach you on the street, taunt you, and then draw their weapons as combat begins. Combat uses the same rules as the original Midkemia role playing pencil and paper game (on which the books are based). While fight ing, a wide variety of activities are possible. Characters can fiddle with their inventory. defend one another, cast spells, and even interact with the environment. One example would be a prison break in which the characters can attack the guards, pick the locks, and equip themselves from their fallen enemy, all during combat Perhaps the coolest feature in RETURN TO KRONDOR is the use of animated 3D models for characters. 7th Level is hard at work creating well-animated models that will be placed on top of beautifully rendered background art. The use of these models allows for minute details that enhance the overall atmosphere. During dialogue, for example, characters will scratch their heads in puzzlement, shake their fists in anger, or helpfully point you in the right direction; while during combat, wizards will make the necessary hand motions when casting spells. RETURN TO KRONDOR also includes such features as an Alchemy Lab, where you craft your own potions, and lock picking, which involves solving an actual lock-oriented puzzle (as opposed to the simple \"use lockpicking skill\" found in most RPGs). Features like true line-ofsight, shadows, and lighting round out the game. With Raymond Feist adding his writing savvy and being even more involved with the design than in BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, RETURN TO KRONDOR looks like it could be one of the best RPGs in years. Thierry Nguyen while not absolutely necessary, it would be a good idea to read Feist's Riftwar novels before playing RETURN TO KRONDOR. Here's a recap of the important MILFIGICHT MUSTER details of the Riftwar saga. Magician: The uber-novel of the saga, this novel was subsequently split into two separate ones (Apprentice and Master) due to its sheer size. This introduced the master magician Pug, and gave many details on the Midkemian universe, such as the Tsurani, the Valheru, and magic in general. M EMES Silverthor: This book introduced the villain Murmandamus, as he sets a plot to assassinate Prince Arutha. Here, Arutha's bride-tobe, Anita, took an arrow meant for him an arrow tipped with the rare poison Silverthorn. Arutha then sets out to find a cure and gain more information about Murmandamus. This novel developed the character of boy-thief Jimmy the Hand, one of the reasons the book was so popular. A Darkness at Sethanon: The final chapter in the Riftwar, this ECOLE brings back all of the main SETUADO) characters of the Riftwar together as Murmandamus marches to Sethanon in order to kill Prince Arutha and free the Valheru from the Lifestone You should also play the first game based on the series: BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR: In the prequel to the new game, the flag of Murmandamus is mikrometo raised again, and Gorath, a moredhel clan-leader, goes to warn Arutha. But, things get twisted and the true enemy is found and thwarted before disturbing the Lifestone again. FIRE ON THE PORT BOW If 7th Level can use their 3D models in both cut-scenes and actual gameplay. RETURN TO KRONDOR will definitely be one of the best looking RPGs. OCTOBER 1997 CGW "

Both com: mand huge followings and have spawned television shows and top-selling music CDs in Japan. When a game from either series debuts in Japan, it is an event tantamount to a big budget movie's premiere. For years, PC gamers have wondered and (admit it) scoffed at the success of these two console RPGs. How could a game made for a medium as limited as an 8or 16-bit cartridge inspire such a following? The answer: It's the storytelling and the characters. But don't take our word for it. You'll be able to see for yourselves when FINAL FANTASY VII comes to the PC in early 1998.

As it's a Japanese RPG, FINAL FANTASY VII also features a few weird and funny player characters that nor. mally wouldn't be seen in American games, including a talking, red tigerlike creature and a strange character duo of an intelligent cat and the yeti-like Moogle (a furry, white, magical crea ture that is a FINAL FANTASY staple).

Of the six previous games in the series, only three have made it to the United States; FFVII is already out in Japan and should arrive here for the PlayStation on September 7 before making its way to the PC next year. The story deals with a world crushed under the iron rule of a country-corporation called Shinra. Shinra controls the world's resources and is responsible for siphoning off Makou, the planet's life energy, making all that lies outside of Shinra's domed city lifeless and barren. The freedom-fighting group Avalanche wants to halt Shinra's para sitic reign. To that end, Avalanche wages a guerril. la war against the establishment, and the charac ters you play get involved with both groups, creat ing a plot of betrayal and intrigue. The three main characters are Cloud Strife, a defector from the Shinra who has joined Avalanche for money; Barret Wallace, the leader of Avalanche, who is on a personal quest to avenge the death of his wife; and Aerith Gainsbourg, a civilian unintentionally drawn into the conflict.

"Get Medieval On Your PC Anachronox Tom Hall Explains His Role-Playing Vision om Hall, one of the leg. endary founders of id software, has some distinguished action games to his credit, but what he has always wanted to create is a role-playing game. Now, as a member of ION Storm, he is fulfilling his wish, crafting a role-playing game inspired by both his years-long desire and the Squaresoft con sole RPGs he has grown to love. The game is called ANACHRONOX, and while it's still early in the game's development cycle (the game won't ship until late 1998). Hall was gracious enough to talk to us about the project. \"ANACHRONOX is a 3D role-playing game using the Quake engine. The player controls up to three characters at a time, from an eventual cast of seven, exploring the galaxy and three different dimensions. Gameplay is exploration of the galaxy, melee with various galactic foes, and discovery of unique weapons and items that aid you in your quest. You can choose different characters and ways of doing things, leading you to a variety of events and areas in the game.\" RAJIIN Hall won't comment on the exact types of enemies you'll face, but there will be recurring villains among the 180-strong rogues' gallery, including this baddie. one is doing what they are doing, and their agendas are important to the story and to what actions they choose and how they go about them.\" Hall wasn't prepared to reveal all the characters, but he did describe a third: \"Grumpos is an old wise man with ridiculously long hair who studies the Elementor discipline of MysTech [Mysterium Technologyl-he is able to actually make new weapons by combining modules called Elements.\" This system of combining modules to create unique weapons is one of the more exciting features of ANACHRONOX. \"The Elementor weapons system is a whole new way for the average user to explore the game and create things,\" says Hall. \"Without any programming knowledge, they can combine Elements to make new weapons and make them part of the game.\" Hall also plans to introduce an Element-maker program so that gamers can incorporate custom-made Elements into the game world for experimentation. Hall's design calls for the game's scope to be truly epic, so you'll be traveling to three dimensions and numerous worlds, and through time, facing hundreds of enemies. Hall feels it's too early to reveal the worlds you'll see and the enemies you'll fight, but we promise to loosen his lips and bring you more information in the months to come. Other vital information Hall could confirm was that the game will be played in third-person, using the Quake II engine. Combat will be realtime, and it will be a single player game. Hall's ION Storm team is already busy into development, but with myriad worlds and events to craft, Hall is very careful not to underestimate the duration of this grand project: He anticipates a late 1998 release. Look for CGW to bring you a full sneak preview as the game progresses.-Elliott Chin alien race and which are now the hubs of trading and civilization. One particular Sender gives the game its name. \"At the center of the universe lies Sender One,\" says Hall, and in a time bubble inside the titanic Sender floats the city of Anachronox. Theory has it that Anachronox was once home to millions of quarantined aliens who slowly died of some horrible plague (the name lit erally means «poison from a previous time\"), leav. ing the city to fall to ruins, only to be taken over by the refuse of the galaxy to become the center of their nefarious dealings.\" It is here that your adventure starts, as you assume control of the main character, Sylvester \"Sly\" Boots, and his partner, Stiletto Anyway. You soon discover that the galaxy is collapsing upon itself and embark on a grand quest to stop this alarming phenomenon.

"Get Medieval On Your PC Forsaken: Thrall of Chaos Eidos Takes On the Devil in a New Isometric Action RPG Forsaken: Thrall of Chaos A X nce Diablo proved to be a megahit, it didn't take an archmage to predict that, as with the real-time strategy blitz, other compa nies would jump on the bandwagon in an attempt to duplicate Blizzard's massive success. One of the first \"DIABLO clones\" out of the gates will be a fantasy RPG from Eidos, called FORSAKEN: THRALL OF CHAOS. Actually, you should take the game's title with a grain of salt, because Eidos, in a fine example of marketing wizardry, has changed the name four times in the week we were preparing this article: from FORSAKEN to ExiLED: THE FORSAKEN SAGA, to EXODUS, to, as we go to press, FORSAKEN: THRALL OF CHAOS. Who knows what it will be called by the time you read this. DIABLO. They hope to improve on Diablo, though, by focusing on that game's biggest weakness: the lack of a truly immersive storyline. FORSAKEN takes place on the island of Ahkuilon, which is ruled by three brutal Warlords. You play the role of Locke (an homage to FINAL FANTASY ||!?), a member of a race of warrior mages who have long been disbanded and exiled from the rest of society. One of the warlords hires you to take revenge upon a cult group on the island that has slain his daughter in a ritual sacrifice. But as you might expect in an RPG, this is just the beginning of the story-and Locke soon discovers that the situation on Ahkuilon is far different than he first realized. At present, FORSAKEN's most compelling feature is its incredible artwork. Canadian artist Den Beauvais, well known for his cover drawings for Dragon magazine, is hand-painting all of the game's prerendered backgrounds. Beauvais's early results show a game with a remarkably rich color palette-with lush greens and bluesan interesting change of pace from the dark look of most recent RPGs. Eidos hopes to one up DIABLO with FORSAKEN: THRALL OF CHAOS, a thirdperson, isometric, action RPG with a stronger emphasis on plot and dialogue Target Release Date: First Quarter 1998 Developer: Cinematix Studios Publisher: Eidos Interactive www.eldos.com The Devil Made Them Do It Developed by Cinematix Studios, makers of the action game TOTAL MAYHEM, FORSAKEN is a third-person, isometric, action RPG, which the designers acknowledge has been consciously inspired by Unlike DIABLO's 2D sprites, FORSAKEN will use 3D polygonal characters with motion-captured anima. tions (3D acceleration will probably be supported, but not required). These characters (also being designed by Beauvais) will appear on top of the prerendered 2D backgrounds, with 3D collision detection underneath. The game also utilizes realtime lighting effects, including colored lights and changes from day to night-when we saw this running in the beta, it was truly beautiful. Fantasy Island Although the entire game takes place on an island, Eidos says there will be some 10 to 12 distinct locations, including cities, forests, underground caverns, and two castles. Conversation with NPCs will be a big part of the game, but there will, of course, be plenty of action. Each character will have spellcasting abilities and five weapon types with three attack styles. The best weapon in your arsenal won't always be the same for every player, but will depend upon how you have developed your character throughout the game. Character advancement will be skill-based, not level-based. Whether Eidos's first-generation RPG will have the mettle to compete with big franchises like MIGHT AND Magic and ULTIMA remains to be seen. --Jeff Green CARTHQUAKE RRIBALL *** XXX WALD 244 SELO STONES BRIGHT LIGHTS FORSAKEN's dynamic colored lighting effects help create a creepy mood for late-night battles.

"Get Medieval On Your PC Deep Six D.W. Bradley, the Wizard of WIZARDRY, Returns With a Brand-New RPG irgin has never been known for its role playing games, but next year, that's likely to change. For its first RPG, tentatively titled DEEP Six, Virgin has at the helm none other than D. W. Bradley, the acclaimed RPG designer, whose most recent work includes WIZARDRY V, VI, and VII for Sirtech. Although the project is still far off (the release is projected for next spring) and Virgin wishes to keep it mostly under wraps for now, we were able to chat with Bradley long enough to get a sense of the game. Set in a medieval fantasy world, DEEP Six will be a party-based, traditional RPG, in which a group of adventurers sets out on a quest to retrieve an enchanted sword and soon finds itself on a larger mission to help defeat an ultimate evil: the Lord of Death. The game world will be completely 3D and will incorporate mul. tiple settings, including forests, castles, dungeons, and an ancient temple that has sunk deep beneath the sea. Bradley and his company, Heuristic Park, are designing the game engine from the ground up to incorporate both single and multiplay (over LANS and modems). In DEEP Six, unlike in Diablo, you'll DEMON SEED This little terror from below is only one of the many monsters you'll face on your joumeys in DEEP Six. be able to build your character in single-player mode and bring him or her into a multiplayer game-and vice versa-in the hopes that you'll develop a character you really care about. Most intriguing so far is the designer's take on the old turn-based versus real-time dilemma for the game's combat system. \"I've talked to a lot of RPGers over the years,\" Bradley says, \"and one of the biggest complaints from some was that they lost a lot of strategic decision-making in real-time combat, and felt like a mechanical monkey clicking the mouse. On the other hand, real-time gamers want a continuous world, where things are constantly changing. I needed a new approach that would eliminate the dichotomy between real-time and turn based, and would let every user play the way he or she wants to play.\" Bradley's solution is to offer the gamer a choice, available at any time-even during combat-between the two modes. Thus, you can move through the game in realtime, but if you encounter a particularly tough enemy, you can slow the pace to give yourself some time to plan out your moves. Bradley says that the game will be balanced so that neither system has an advantage over the other and so that all gamers, regardless of preference, can get the same essential experience. Trying to please everyone can be a tricky business, but Bradley says that he and his Heuristic Park team are \"making the game that we, as roleplaying fans, want to see ourselves.\" Given the designer's track record, we're going to want to see it too. Look for an in-depth sneak preview of DEEP Six in an upcoming issue of CGW.-Jeff Green Deep SixO This fantasy RPG will incorporate both single and multiplay, as well as real-time and turn-based combat.

It had stals and spells, but it also combined classic Sierra adventure-game elements with intense combat. After the success of the first title, the series grew to encompass three more games, set in various fantasy locales based on the Middle East, Africa, and Transylvania. While the quests, monsters, and environments changed from game to game, the main character and a few nonplayer characters did not. Moreover, an overarching plot was weaved into each game, meaning that a continu ity was achieved that compelled you to play each successive title. It's been a long four years, but, reu at last, the final game in the series is about to debut: QUEST FOR GLORY 5: DRAGON FIRE. IN HONOR OF THIEVES There aren't levels in DRAGON FIRE, but, rather skills that you advance through with frequent use. As a thief, you could practice pickpocketing on this dummy A Mediterranean Holiday You reprise your role as the hero (always The kingdom has just lost its ruler to assassi. nameless), and have ventured to the land of nation, and monsters prowl the land whilst a Silmaria, a Mediterranean-type environment. great black dragon looms over the horizon. Lori Cole, the designer of all previous QUEST games, is hinting that this could be the finale of the series, so the story will tie up all loose ends, and gamers will finish the game with a feeling of completion. Many of the previous games' NPCs will return for this encore, including Rakeesh the liontaur from QUESTS 2 and 3, Katrina the vampire from QUEST 4, and Erasmus, the wizard who taught you spells in QUEST 1. However, as a new game, QUEST 5 EN GARDE Combat now occurs in the game world, will thrust you into a whole new envirather than on a separate screen. Before, combat was a ronment with its own share of brandlittle jarring, but now it is seamlessly integrated, new faces. As with other QUEST FOR QUEST FOR GLORY 5: DRAGON FIRE is the final entry in the QUEST saga. You'll travel to the Mediterranean land of Silmaria, battling undead, Greek monsters, and a terrorizing dragon.

"Get Medieval On Your PC GLORY games, Cole promises to deliver characters with personality, as well as plenty of humor and even romance in the story. 56 Stats and Skills Like previous Quest games, you'll be able to choose from three classes: wizard, warrior, and thief. You will be able to import your characters from previous games. DRAGON FIRE isn't level. based, but skill-based. You have standard attributes, such as strength and intelligence, as in other games, and a variety of skills. You'll have a different set of skills depending on your class, such as pickpocketing for thieves, spellcasting for wizards, and defense for warriors. You can increase your skills through normal use or practice. For example, in the Thieves Guild, you can practice pickpocketing on the dummy and advance your skill level. If you fight constantly, your weapon skill will automatically increase. Continual spellcasting will also improve your spell skills. The game does change depending on your class, as you'll have to defeat major enemies according to your skill set (through trickery, spells, or combat). As far as spells, there are  G9GbG69556993 ORI 561) + ee SCRETE LIGHTS OUT As in previous games, time will pass, so you can adventure during both day and night. Some actions, especially thievery, can be performed only at night. quite a few, including fireball, levitation, lightning ball, open doors, protection, and flight. To Be King In the tradition of the series, there will be several subplots to play through before the final showdown with evil. After the king has been assassinated, you and two other heroes come forward to compete for the right to take the crown in the Rites of Rulership. These Rites will take you through the game's various quests and subplots. You'll have to stem the invasion of a neighboring kingdom, battle the monsters in the beleaguered kingdom, thwart an army of undead from the dark realm of Hades, defeat a monstrous Hydra, and discover the sunken city of Atlantis. Ultimately, though, the dark hand that has guided all these evil forces will throw its last menace at you: the black dragon, Fire. The biggest change in the series, apart from the much updated graphics and beautiful prerendered environments, is the combat. It is no longer played in a separate screen that draws you out of the game world. Now, combat occurs in the adventuring environment in realtime. The other big change is the inclusion of mul. tiplayer support. You can actually play through the whole game with up to two other characters. Presumably, each of you will play as one of the three contestants in the Rites of Rulership. There will be support for modem or LAN play. QUEST 5 still needs to be polished: game speed is fairly slow now, but Sierra does plan to optimize the game. Also, while we've played a little of the game, we still haven't seen the full quests, Rites, and NPCs. However, if Sierra can implement these elements as well as they did in previous QUEST games, all the while polishing the game's speed and look, DRAGON FIRE should not disappoint. As the probable last entry in the QUEST FOR GLORY line, you'll meet old friends and finally make your way to the promised land of Silmaria. With an improved, integrated combat engine; a variety of locales to visit and numerous quests and mon. sters to surmount, QUEST FOR GLORY 5 could prove to be the best of the series.-Elliott Chin SPLASH The Queen of Atlantis is only one of the various creatures you'll meet.

"Get Medieval On Your PC Dark Earth France's Kalisto Reveals the Art of Darkness ou see it the first time you move from one room to another. The colorful room with its stylized Jules Verne architecture and the primary character in his brightly adorned uniform are both swallowed by darkness. DARK EARTH is a study in contrasts: light/darkness, goodlevil, freedom/fear, initiativelritual, humanity/monstrosity, and lifeldeath. Just as Francis Ford Coppola used sharply etched shadow to suggest the fearful majesty of the Godfather's hidden power, DARK EARTH uses the backdrop of an allconsuming darkness and its corresponding images to shape its universe. DARK EARTH takes place in a postapoca lyptic world in which mankind has experienced near-obliteration. So much debris fills the air after this cataclysm that perpetual darkness shrouds the world; poisonous clouds drift overhead, and photosynthesis has stopped. Only a few pockets of light remain. Into these pockets have flown the uncontaminated remnants of humanity. FENCE OF DARKNESS You'll see Impressive close-ups of the action as you fence, fight, slash, and smash your way to success in DARK EARTH's combat sequences. OEK EARTH Dancin' in the Dark For the most part, the game is extremely easy to navigate. You use arrow keys to move around, the space bar to use objects or initiate conversation, and the key to enter combat mode. Combat is in realtime and can be set for easy or tough battles. Once in combat mode, you press Ctrl and hit the arrow keys for your various moves. All of the characters are 3D, and the game contains numerous attractive 3D objects. However, rooms are not connected for pure 3D scrolling, and there are times when objects such as staircases are not fully implemented as 3D, leading to some awkward animated sequences in which the characters do not mesh perfectly with the environment. Of course, you might wonder why Kalisto opted for 3D figures and objects if you aren't viewing the action in first-person and you can't scroll smoothly from one room to the next. The beauty of the 3D art is that whenever you enter combat, First, they build temples to Ra, the Sun God. Then, entire cities (called Stallites) rise up around these temples. Entire social structures evolve out of the need to maintain light, heat, and genetic purity. Two elite groups rule this light-oriented soci. ety: the priestly Sunseers and the military Guardians of Fire. In the best of all possible setups, your character is a Guardian of Fire named Arkhan, a policeman trained for immediate action and the son of a Sunseer named Rylsedaar-you are sensitized to the history, myth, and dynamics of your culture. In the worst of all possible situations, you are soon thrust into a situation where the bulk of this cultural structure stands against you. In this postapocalyptic role playing adventure you play a Guardian of Fire attempting to stave off the contamination of your society. Ironically you become a part of that contagion Target Release Date: October 1997 Developer: Kalisto (formerly Mindscape Bordeau Publisher, Electronic Arts www.kalisto.com CGW OCTOBER 1997 "


"Get Medieval On Your PC this is the old FMV problem (read: lack of control) all over again. DARK AEGIS Monuments from an earlier era guide you through the cultural background of the DARK EARTH universe and provide vital clues for the endgame. Stallite 19 DARK EARTH has an extremely well-conceived storyline. You start with a clear-cut concept of light versus darkness and good versus evil. Your first combat pits you against murdering guerril. las who have invaded the sacred confines of the Temple of Ra and do not hesitate to slaughter the Sunseers. Unfortunately, when you defeat the first foe, you find yourself caught in a vain attempt to rescue Lory, the greatest of the Sunseers, only to end up being contaminated by a black, porous, ice cold parasitic ooze called Shankr Archessence. This substance, you soon discover, causes you to slowly transform into one of the mutant creatures of darkness from which you have always protected society-and now, your fel. low Guardians of Fire are out to get you. You learn that you must locate your father and get him to show you a hidden crypt wherein lies the secret to your healing. Your own Stallite becomes a prison to you as you try to free yourself-and the world around youfrom the danger. As events unfold around and upon you, you learn the wisdom of a statement propounded by an old priest: \"Night is an ordeal feared only by the impure.\" You discover that a perfectly ordered society may not be quite as perfect as you once thought. Of course, this penetration into deeper and deeper shades of gray is exactly what design director Guillaume Le Pennec is striving for: an attempt to portray prejudice and fear in (pardon the pun) an entirely new light. Kalisto adds just the right touch of moral ambiguity to DARK EARTH to stimulate the imagination and compel you to keep playing. In terms of story, game world, and artistic touches, DARK EARTH is an objet d'art. As a game, it is even having some success as a pen-andpaper role-playing game in France. (Casus Belli, the marvelous French role-playing magazine, gave the pen-and-paper game a positive review and is currently publishing additional scenarios.) Whether the combat and puzzles are enough to carry it as a computer game remains to be seen. The puzzles are lighter than the typical adventure game, and the combat doesn't have quite the subtlety of a pure action game. It's a nice balance for some, but may seem too lightweight for others Johnny L. Wilson DARKOVER Whenever you see the symbol of Ra on the wall, you can save your game of DARK EARTH. you get fast action, smooth animation, and plenty of camera angles. At first, this might seem disori enting, but as you play the game, you realize that the close-ups, pans, and over-the-shoulder views add to the excitement of each encounter. Easy mode will prove to be too much of a cakewalk for action gamers, but its inclusion means that even those who don't care for action sequences can get through the game without dying. Gameplay consists of combat and conversation separated by the occasional puzzle (of the find-the-right-object or information variety). Successful combat sequences, appropriate con versations, and the mere zen of being in the right place at the right time lead to cinematic cutscenes with intriguing camera angles, impres. sive graphics, and visceral levels of violence. The downside of the design is that your conversational options are predetermined by the attitude you adopt in an out-of-interface setup screen. The conversations play more cinemati. cally this way, but some gamers may feel that DARK SECRETS You manipulate weapons and objects in DARK EARTH via an inventory screen that is strictly click, drag, and drop.

"Shareware: The Nets Best Bets Exile III: Ruined World Questing the Old-Fashioned (and Inexpensive) Way EXILE III: RUINED WORLD O This game from Spiderweb Software-appearing on our CG-ROM this month and avail able as a download from Spiderweb's Web site-has been a big hit among role play ers for months, almost entirely because of word-of-mouth on Net newsgroups. Exile III is the third game in Spiderweb's epic tale of the struggle between the Empire and the Exiles. In this game, after years of a stalemate, the Exiles have found a way to reach the surface, and you and your party are sent to explore. At first, the game looks exactly like what it is-a shareware game with primitive graphics. But if you keep playing, you'll discover a remarkably deep, traditional RPG far more com. plex than its appearance would indicate. Character creation is very flexible--you can even assign disadvantages such as \"magically inept\" or \"bad back,\" which will affect how much experience you need to advance levels. Combat is turn-based, the spell system-divided into two classes-is deep, and the ample dialogue with NPCs is well written and witty throughout. Rounding out the game are elegant touches such as an automap and a journal that automatically keeps track of your quests. Jeff Vogel --Exile's designer and programmer-has created an RPG like they used to make.\" And it costs only $25 to play. ---Jeff Green Exte III won't blow you away with its graphics, but everything else about the game-charac ters, plot, design, dialogue-is first rate, traditional RPG gaming Target Release Date: Available now Developer: Spiderweb Software Publisher: Spiderweb Software www.spidweb.com Grimoire A Classic Computer Role-Playing Game From the Net GRIMOIRE wo classic computer game references popped immediately to mind when I first booted the alpha version of GRIMOIRE, a CRPG available only via the Internet. The first was MIGHT AND MaGic. In GRIMOIRE, you con stantly explore the world via a 3D first-person win dow-just as you did in the original MIGHT AND Magic (and WIZARDRY before it). The second was ZORK. Remember that maze of look-alike passages? You're always in a maze in Grimoire-at least in the parts we've seen. If you like the character classes of classic role. playing, you'll immediately find yourself comfort able with the Adepts, Clansmen (humanoid player characters evolved from other biological strains), Conjurors, Guardsmen, Pickpockets, and Traders to be found in GRIMOIRE. You'll feel comfortable with the skill sets and the career paths that are available. Most gamers will enjoy the many combat options at their disposal: Hide, run, shield, fight, cast (spell), use (artifact), or surrender. Also in the classic vein is the background story for GRIMOIRE. You outfit a party to quest in search of the \"Metronome Mysterium,\" the so-called Clock of Fate that winds down into anomie and portends the end of the world. Instead of trying to \"Kill Foozle,\" it's the party's task to find the cosmic pendulum and rewind the clock that ticks off the world's fate. GRIMOIRE has solid potential and may be just the unguent necessary for long-time role. players who want more than real-time, firstperson dungeon crawls. It may also prove the worth of online distribution for independent designers and publishers. Johnny L.

There's no reason to be pessimistic, but, after writing about this game for more than a year, we're going to stop saying \"It'll be out soon.\" Now we'll just say we hope it's out soon. Lord British, your greatness, your subjects are ready to play.-Jeff Green A host of new weapons and more than 100 new spells to master round out the changes to this already hugely popular online RPG. Whether new players will discover the game amid all the MERIDIAN 59: REVELATION Ultima Online Of course, no RPG guide would be complete without mentioning the ultrahigh-profile ULTIMA ONLINE, the online RPG with the potential to ULTIMA ONLINE An entirely new version of 300's year old multi plazer RPG.

Target Release Date: Fall 1997 Developer: Origin Publisher: EA Origin www.ultimaonline.com Meridian 59: Revelation MERIDIAN 59 may not get the same attention that ULTIMA ONLINE is receiving, but 3DO's Internet-based RPG has boasting rights for one huge reason: It actually celebrates its one year anniversary this October. In that year, the game's thousands of fans have created a living, breath. ing alternate universe, and the developers have continued to tweak the game with upgrades and expansion packs. Now, 3DO is readying the biggest upgrade yet, called MERIDIAN 59: REVELATION, which is essentially an entirely new version of the game. Due this fall, REVELATION promises to improve or expand virtually every aspect of the game. On the aesthetic front, the developers have completely redesigned the interface and upgraded the first-person graphic engine to keep up with the times. Player and mon ster graphics have also been improved, and they've tweaked the monster Al so that monsters can now ally with each other in combat or be tamed by you to fight on your side. 300 has added tons of new quests and sidequests, and promises to make the experience more \"game like\" for those seeking more than just a MUD-like social hangout. The team has created an entirely new island city complete with a race of beings with their own culture and language. The overall quest in REVELATION involves traveling to this island city and uncovering the mysteries therein. But it won't be something that any random newbie just logging on can join. Newcomers will need to explore the existing world of MERIDIAN 59, garnering strength, experience, and magic, before they're strong enough to deal with the new land. This will keep the game friendly enough for new users, while giving longtime gamers a brand-new challenge for their already battle toughened characters. noise being generated by ULTIMA ONLINE remains to be seen, but MERIDIAN 59-as of this writing, anyway-has one irrefutable competitive advantage: It's up, live and running.—Jeff Green either soar into gaming greatness or take a Wile E.

Much as we may protest that these are only games (see this month's editorial), the idea of innate superiority/inferiority can subtly lead us into real life discrimination. ASHERON'S CALL, instead, very sensitively labels the variety of cultural back grounds found in the game as \"heritage groups.\" Such a designation offers a nonhomo. geneous population for the game world without emphasizing racial stereotypes (whether drawn from reality or fantasy). As you continue to view the game, you realize that this is an RPG with true beauty and originality. Social interaction in ASHERON'S CALL is \"allegiance-based.\" This means that your actions and social standing, as well as the overarching social dynamics in the world, are based on the groups to which you belong, and their agendas. The agendas are, in turn, established and evolved by the player characters themselves. The design team will occasionally plant seeds for a given agenda, but the players can opt to go with the seeds or not. The social design of ASHERON'S CALL may well be the most intricate ever in an online role-playing experience.

"Get Medieval On Your PC The Five Greatest Computer Role-Playing Games of All Time f you had to name the five greatest com puter role-playing games of all time, you would probably pick the ones we've selected (or other entries in the same series). We've provided the complete games for these five RPGs on this month's CG ROM. Play them for yourself and see if you don't agree with our reasons. gamers found that they couldn't necessarily count on nonplayer characters to share ammuni: tion, take the point, or perform dangerous deeds in order to save the rest of the party. Other nice touches included Danforth's infamous \"rabid dog\" scenario, in which you were forced to pay the consequences of your deed. its era. Most of all, it had great pacing as you maneuvered through intricate mazes in breathless suspense, a tremendous amount of hack-'n-slash combat, a wide sampling of magical spells, and a simple, yet charming story. The graphics have improved over the years and its progeny, MIGHT AND MAGIC VI. promises to offer another fresh perspective with its 3D graphics and architectural styles, but there's something special about the original. It's tough, but worth it. ULTIMA IV When Richard Garriott decided to put virtue in ULTIMA IV, he wasn't satisfied with preaching a static morality. He wanted, from character-cre. ation onward, to confront the gamer with moral dilemmas, challenging choices, and a powerful story. With the concept of avatarhood, Garriott succeeded in doing what many other role play. ing games had failed to do: Cause gamers to think about real life in new and different ways. BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR This game wasn't special just because it brought Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia to life on the computer screen, although that might have been enough. It was the first adventure game to try to give you a 3D first-person feel (even though some of the characters look like paper dolls pasted onto the environment). It also offered a very fresh and new magical interface that worked wonderfully and fit the Midkemian milieu perfectly. All in all, a great game with solid balance and lots of surprises. WIZARDRY VI To many gamers, the WIZARDRY series as a whole could fill any list of the Top Five RPGs of All Time. It was the first maze-view dungeon crawl and offered deep and challenging role-play at a time when many computer games were merely stickman versions of HACK, a mainframe hack-'n-slash game. WIZARDRY VI stands high as the first game in the series to blend fantasy and Sci-fi into its realms and the first WIZARDRY game to offer full-screen color. Some gamers would argue that WIZARDRY IV is the best, given its diabolical puzzles and the opportunity you have to play the villain, but we chose WIZARDRY VI as the most accessible WIZARDRY yet available. WASTELAND With a story by Mike Stackpole (of BattleTech and X-Wing novel fame) and maps by Liz Danforth, Ken St. Andre, and others, WASTELAND emerged as an epic game of postapocalyptic combat, mystery, and puzzles. For the first time, MIGHT AND MAGIC The first game in a hugely successful series, MIGHT AND MAGIC redefined the term epic. It had the largest map of any fantasy RPG up to that time and featured the most upscale documentation for Crystal Ball WADA azing further into the future, your RPG soothsayer sees a number of promising titles on the horizon. We predict that about the time you read this, you'll be hearing an announcement about DIABLO 2though Blizzard won't confirm this as we go to press. Last month's E3 roundup reported that Sir-Tech was working on WIZARDRY VIII. While this is still true, we have since learned that it will be a fall 1998 release-at best. Finally, rumors abound about ULTIMA IX. Lord British and his minions at Origin all promise that this is still going to happen, but the immense difficulty of devel oping ULTIMA ONLINE has pushed the single-player game back to the point where no one is talking dates at all. An early screenshot from WIZARDRY VIII, which Sir-Tech is promising for a late '98 release. OCTOBER 1997 CGW "

Sure. onto the box and sell a lot of cards despite under whelming 3D performance. Matrox proved there was a market for 2D/3D accelerators that left out certain mainstream 3D image-quality features. The hardware was there. It was the software that came up missing. For months, the only accelerated software titles out there came bundled in the same box with their graph. ics cards. A few titles shipped that offered support for a specific chip, but because Microsoft shipped Direct3D late, and because Direct3D proved somewhat difficult to use, titles have only just begun to hit store shelves. Despite this dearth, a lot of 3D cards were sold. One reason was the huge consumer education effort undertaken by many 3D vendors. Don't get me wrong, there were some interesting point products. Boards using the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset stole the show with their stellar performance and image quality. Rendition proved you could have solid 3D performance alongside reasonable 2D and SVGA-graphics performance. Cards using the S3 ViRGE chip proved you could slap \"3D\" CGW OCTOBER 1997 "


"BILINEAR FILTERING Makes a texture map appear more realistic by averaging the color values of adjacent pixels. This blurs the pixels, reducing the blockiness when viewing the texture up close. If a board doesn't support this feature, you'll get pointsampling (on the left). Another reason was the huge success of the 3D-accelerated versions of QUAKE-first, Rendition-accelerated VQUAKE proved that you could have significantly enhanced image quality and a good frame rate, then GL QUAKE arrived on the scene with its superb lighting and transparency effects. Another showcase title was TOMB RAIDER from Eidos, with its beautiful, motion-captured virtualaction diva, Lara Croft. FOG EFFECTS Blending objects in the distance with a fixed color yields a haze or foggy appearance. If a chip doesn't support fog, it'll be pretty obvious. But looking at the image on the right, you see that fog can add tremendously to the overall effect in a game scene. Enter the Hardware Onslaught noon we'll have a host of hot 3D iron, as well as some seriously accelerated 3D titles. If last year U was the beginning, 1997 is the arrival. With any luck, 1998 will move along at warp speed. If you read our July 1996 issue, some of the 3D techno-speak covered here is probably old hat by now, though we'll also tell you about some new developments of interest. But if you're just begin ning to get versed in 3D, then this will be a good place to get started. Evolution of the Revolution In the summer of 1996, 3D accelerators began to arrive in quick succession. Last year, we tested quite a few 3D cards, and a year ago a lot of these cards looked pretty good. There were no reliable benchmarks on the market, DOS games were still king, and the handful of Direct3D games out were not very good at measur ing performance. The landscape was divided up into the mainstream players. the upstarts, and the dedicated 3D chips. The mainstream play. ers--ATI, S3, and Matrox-delivered fast 2D cards, but had OCTOBER 1997 CGW "


"HARDWARE PERSPECTIVE CORRECTION Perspective correction makes texture maps correctly converge at a given distance, giving them a more realistic appearance when viewed from different angles. You can see in the shot on the left that without this feature, things can get just a bit skewed 50 Cabrycet peciv Couection Madale Double buted, 220 out, though, since games based on the Quake engine will all support OpenGL, and some of them promise to be blockbusters. mixed 3D performance. The upstarts included Rendition and NVIDIA, NVIDIA'S NV1 chip hit the market first, in Diamond's Edge 3D, and attempt. ed much-trying to deliver sound and joystick support as well as graphics-but delivered too little. The Rendition V1000 series had some limitations, but proved that a combination 2D/3D accelerator could pack a solid 3D punch without giving up much 2D performance. 3Dfx and VideoLogic took radically different approaches in bringing dedicated 3D accelerators to market. The 3Dfx Voodoo chipset delivered stunning performance and image quality using a more traditional rendering pipeline. The PowerVR chip took a more radical approach that eliminated the need for frame.buffer memory, but suffered Direct3D teething problems (see this month's review). All of these players are poised to deliver new chips that promise sig. nificant increases in rendering performance. After wandering in the wilderness, NVIDIA has stormed back with the RIVA 128, a chip focused on just three things: hot-rod 3D graphics, superb 2D graphics, and digi tal video acceleration. Rendition is set to deliver the V2200, which will offer a 3X performance increase in 3D and serious 2D and video fea. tures-all the while maintaining compatibility with the V1000. VideoLogic is bringing the second-generation PowerVR chip, the PCX2, to the forefront, while 3Dfx has given users a real RushVoodoo Rush, that is. Even mainstream stalwart ATI is poised to bring a potentially hot performer in the form of the Rage Pro-its third generation of 3D accelerators and probably the most innovative architecture it has done yet. Then there's software. While the controversy over the Direct3D versus OpenGL issue looks like a Tyson-Holyfield bite...er...bout (see sidebar) scores of Direct3D titles are set to be delivered this fall. OpenGL isn't left It's the Experience, Stupid It's easy to overlook the fact that 3D graphics isn't an end in itself but, rather, a means to deliver an immersive experience. Recently, we booted lup the Direct3D version of MECHWARRIOR MERCENARIES on a Monster-3D card and were sharply reminded that it's the experience that counts. MERCENARIES is almost a different game using Direct 3D, with night battles taking on an eerie feel as laser bolts and missiles light up the darkness Aiming seems much easier, and the ground looks a lot more real when you fall over after one of your mech's legs gets blown off. Several factors contribute to an immersive experience. Certainly, frame rate is critical. The prettiest image quality is pointless if the game looks like a slide show. On the other hand, if you can average a solid 25-30 frames per second with the kind of image quality that 3Dfx delivers, 40fps of blocky, pixelated scenery suddenly loses its appeal. So you need to weigh both issues: Look at the claimed image quality delivered by the 3D hardware and the frame rate actually delivered by a variety of games. Benchmarks like 3D WinBench help, but it's really the games that tell the story. CGW OCTOBER 1997 "


"00 Next month, we'll take a look at a variety of 3D accelerators and test them with several game titles, as well as 3D WinBench. Most accelerators support a variety of 3D features. The minimum set you need to look for is perspective-corrected texture mapping and point sampling. However, we believe quite strongly that bilinear filtering adds a lot to the mix, and MIP-mapping (see glossary) improves image quality. particularly in games with lots of movement across distance. Good transparency effects are rapidly becoming a must think of the water effects in GL QUAKE). And fog effects can add that last little bit of verisimilitude-climbing to the top of a foggy hill in MERCENARIES really keeps you on your toes. Finally, don't discount the performance of the CPU. There's a myth going around that a fast 3D card will make up for a slow CPU, but as our CPU testing last month indicated, that's not the case. Yes, a 3D accelerator will help an older system keep up with some games, but there's still a lot of geometry being calculated by the processor in order to give the acceler ator something to render. Things to Come Next month's graphics card roundup will consist exclusively of 3D. capable hardware. We have a number of very cool cards on the way, including your first look at several new AGP boards. Here's just a taste of what's in store: Boards from Diamond and STB, using NVIDIA's new Riva 128 chip  ATI's new Xpert@Play, using ATI's new Rage Pro Two boards using 3Dfx's Voodoo Rush chipset from Hercules and Intergraph Hercules' and ELSA's new Permedia 2-based boards  VideoLogic's Apocalypse 3DX and 5DX, using NEC/VideoLogic's PolyerVR chip Matrox's new Mystique 220, plus a new 3D surprise they've got in the works Number Nine Revolution 3D We'll also give you an early look at 3D iron still in development, including Rendition's V2200, Tritech's Pyramid3D, and Oak Technology's Warp 5 chip. TRANSPARENCY METHODS These blend texture maps so that parts appear transparent. The two primary techniques are color key (a single color is defined as transparent) and alpha blending (in which transparency values can vary according to the alpha value-usually 256 transparency levels). If implemented incorrectly, transparency will sometimes be drawn black, preventing you from seeing through the supposedly transparent object. Not a pretty sight. 30 3.

Some of the more clever designs use trays that snap out easily, but attaching the actual ribbon cable is often a chore, even for an extremely dexterous person with very small hands. Although some systems come with built-in graphics and audio, for the most part expansion cards inserted in slots handle the graphics and audio chores.

They even plan to make unattended setup more feasible. A whole host of technologies is being brought to the table. What follows is a laundry list of some of the items. If you want to take a look yourself, download the preliminary PC-98 spec from Microsoft at www.microsoft.com/hwdev/pc98.htm. There won't be a single PC standard. There will be a basic PC-98 standard, which all the others have to begin with, but they'll diverge from there. There'll be a consumer PC 98,\" an \"entertain ment PC 98,\" and a \"workstation PC LIGHT MY FIREWIRE One of the most important features is high-speed connectivity. The PC-98 spec calls for IEEE 1394 as a primary high-speed interface. IEEE 1394 began life as Firewire, a serial link for highspeed peripherals (ironically, it was invented by Apple). Peripherals can be daisy-chained together, and Microsoft is calling for a minimum data rate of 600Mbits/sec, or roughly 75MB/sec. This is some serious bandwidth, folks; it's suitable for hard-drives, which are one of the connection options. In fact, embedded deep in the document arc words like \"EIDE drives should be connected via IEEE 1394.\" This will certainly make it much easier to connect high-speed peripherals. IEEE 1394 is also good for anything that requires a big pipe for data. One of the other interesting features that will UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE The other main connectivity source will be the Universal Serial Bus (USB), which may prove more significant than Firewire from a day-to-day usage perspective. In the future, you'll connect your keyboard, mouse, multiple joysticks/controllers, modem, and other serial devices by USB. The cool thing is that USB is \"hot-swappable.\" You p lug the device in the system autoconfigures for it (no reboots, folks), and off you go. You may have to install a driver the first time you connect it, but that will just mean popping in a CD and walking away-the PC-98 spec talks often about installation without user intervention.

"LOYD CASE TECHNOLOGY Internet Explorer 4.0 will use Direct3D-for VRML, but also for user-interface tweaks. So, 3D will be the mainstream, THE BIG SLEEP How the computer handles power will be very different from today as well. The power switch in the future PC will not be a real power switch but, rather, a \"sleep\" switch. When you punch the power switch, it will go into a very low-power, quiescent mode. Press the button again, and you'll find yourself just where you left off. I can just imagine doing this in the middle of a QUAKE level: \"Ohmigosh, a Vore! Hit the power switch!\" Imagine the reaction when your spouse comes along and turns on the computer.... You'll be able to tum the computer completely off by selecting Shutdown from the start menu. Can you say\"Macintosh\"? Since most audio cards are ISA, the sound card and modem vendors had better move to PCI, USB, or IEEE 1394 pretty quickly-and it seems they will, what with audio migrating to PCI and modems going to USB. It's very likely that next year's PC will still have serial ports, parallel ports, and so on, but the move to faster, friendlier connectivity will be strongly encouraged. The biggest change on the graphics front, without a doubt, will be the new Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) architecture, which will move graphics off the PCI bus and onto the main memory bus itself. This migration will make room for other PCI devices (disk controllers, sound cards, and the like) and give graphics up to a 4X bandwidth increase, which will be vital for more complex 3D games. Other changes are less dramatic: All PCs will have TV out and 3D acceleration. In fact, one gem buricd in the PC-98 spec is that MS PLUG IN AND PLAY Finally, there's DeviceBay, an emerging standard for expanding your system. Instead of popping open a case, cutting your fingers, and trying to use screws made for inhumanly small hands, you'll just pull out the old device and insert the new one. This will work for all devices except graphics and your boot drive. Upgrading to the latest, fastest, biggest, whizbang device will be a cinch. DeviceBay makes use of IEEE 1394, which allows devices to be hot-swapped. So it looks as if the PC for the millennium will be easy to configure and upgrade; and it will be very, very fast. It's the Nirvana that all computer gamers dream of. Now if we can only get DirectX to install that easily.... THE MORE THINGS CHANGE... What about \"legacy» devices? One key feature that will be missing are ISA cards. In fact, the PC-98 people would love to do away with ISA slots entirely. his is the 125th Anniversary of Arbor Day, the tree planters' holiday.

"***** REVIEW INTERGRAPH TD-25 SYSTEM HARDWARE Intergraph Delivers Much Performance Though Few Extras by Dave Salvator ntergraph is not a name known to most gamers. But anyone who's ever shopped for a 3D workstation has undoubtedly heard of these guys. As the consumer PC space begins to concentrate more on 3D graphics, Intergraph has jumped into the fray with a variety of system offerings, and these boxes are priced to move. Intergraph also has a build-to-order, direct-purchase Web site where you can build the rig you want, with all the bells and whistles, and find out the total price. The TD-25 is Intergraph's higher midrange system, using Intel's 233MHz Pentium with MMX (P55C), and what it lacks in extras, it makes up for (somewhat) in performance Setting up the TD-25 is fairly straightforward, though none of the ports on the back of the box are labeled. The documentation, though somewhat brief, makes setup easy, and within about 10 minutes, the TD-25 is good to go. The innards are easily accessed sans tools after removing six\"thumb screws,\" and the interior layout allows easy access to most system components. The Phoenix BIOS is pretty rudimentary, and doesn't allow for much in the way of low-level tweaks. The unit we evaluated included a keyboard with embedded speakers, which may be fine for corporate types who want to hear «ding\" every time they do a 10-10, but for gamers these speakers clearly are not up to the task. Intergraph was investigating speaker upgrade options at press time. We did encounter several other rough edges along the way. For starters. the DOSSTART.BAT isn't properly configured to bring up real-mode drivers for the sound card and CD-ROM drive. Also, Intergraph doesn't include a copy of DirectX 3.0a (current version) on the hard drive to re-install drivers should a misbehaving game hose your DirectX setup. What's in the Box?

"***** REVIEW  ARCADIA AR 27 MONITOR Seein' the Big Show HARDWARE by Dave Salvator hen it comes to displays, bigger is better. As first-person games have become all the rage for shooters, flight sims, and driving titles, the bigger picture can go a long way toward total immersion. And while 17-inch monitors have become affordable, larger displays (over 20 inches) have remained expensive. Until now. Princeton Graphics has unveiled its 27inch Arcadia Home Monitor, the AR27. both with and without speakers, and both units are less than $1,000 The first thing you notice about the Arcadia is that its huge, and heavy.

Arcadias versatile audio/video ins and outs include VGA, three video (two composite, one S-video) inputs, and two stereo audio inputs. There's also an audio out that acts as a pass-through so you can route your audio signal to your stereo amplifier. At 800x600, the monitor's image quality is solid across the board. Using a testing tool developed by sister publication Computer Shopper, we looked at focus, geometry, convergence, color tracking, and flicker. On all fronts, Arcadia delivers sharp image quality. On the flicker test, there is no noticeable flicker. Came video looks great, and having a screen this big makes playing games of any genre more enjoyable. Turning off all the room lights and running QUAKE through a 27-inch monitor made for an eerie experience indeed. VCR video also looked fine running through one of Arcadias composite inputs. The only mild disappointment was the embedded speakers' sound quality. Bass response was surprisingly good, considering the absence of an external woofer, but the mids and highs were muddy. If you've got a good pair of speakers, opt for the speakerless version, and you'll be fine. If you're looking to build your own living room PC or just want a colossal screen for all your gaming adventures, Arcadias AR27 is a great choice & APPEAL: Gamers looking for a frickin' huge monitor.

The compressed stereo imaging seems nearly ideal for game playing Voice and sound effects sound great, and game music sounds just fine, although you won't shake any rafters with the System 25. For about a hundred bucks, these little guys deserve some serious consideration Check'em out. by Loyd Case he System 25 is Yamaha's 3-speaker entry into the budget category, consisting of a powered bass unit and two satellites. The list price isa mere $129, but it's likely that the street price will be under $100. Haul the System 25 out of the box, and you'll be amazed at just how tiny the satellites are. Measuring a scant 3.5x2.5 inches (about 4.5 inches deep), they can either be placed on a desk or mounted on a monitor. Miniature stands attached to each satellite swing out so that you can easily adjust speaker angle. Setup is straightforward. The satellites plug into the bass unit -and the connectors are different, so you can't make a mistake. There's a power button and volume control on one of the satellites. The bass unit has its own bass boost control. You plug your sound card output into one of the two input sockets on the back of the bass module. The power supply is built into the bass unit -no power brick, thank the gods. I tested these speakers with a wide array of music and had a very odd reaction. High-end response is quite good for such tiny units; bass response is surprisingly robust; and voices sound lively and realistic. But the overall feeling left me wanting, and it took a while to realize what was happening. Stereo imaging is very precisenote that I didn't say accurate -but the entire stereo image is between the two speakers. When you set them on either side of a monitor (a typical setup for home or office computing) the imaging is very two-dimensional. There's no feeling of depth at all, as if the entire band or orchestra has been squeezed down into a twofoot wide space. So these aren't the greatest speakers for music. Cames are another story. I ran QUAKE, Jane's new 6881, RED ALERT, and WING APPEAL: Gamers on a budget looking for good sound. PROS: Easy setup; good sound quality; compact size; low price.

"***** REVIEW  TERRATEC BASE I SOUND CARD Sounds Like a Deal HARDWARE by Loyd Case 've always been a little leery of bargain-basement sound cards. I've had more problems with cheap audio cards than with just about any other peripheral. Yet, I'm always on the lookout for low-cost audio, hoping to find a gem in the rough. I'm happy to report that I think I've found one. Terratec is a Cerman manufacturer of sound cards; its previous efforts have mostly focused on high-end audio for audiophiles and musicians. The Terratec Basel is the company's first foray into the true consumer-audio space. Installation is a snap. Just pop the card into a 200MI IZ Pentium MMX system, and on boot-up, Windows 95 auto-detects the card and installs the Windows drivers without a murmur of complaint. You need to run a separate install to set up DOS drivers (which allow Base I to emulate a Soundblaster Pro). This $60 card doesn't come with a built-in wavetable--you only get FM synthesis but the digital audio sounds very clean. The only jumper on the card activates or deactivates the onboard amplifier; and with the amp disabled, the card is very quiet (through powered speakers). Windows wave audio sounds very good and MIDI playback is typical FM synthesis lets just say it works as expected. There's also a 3D sound option called VSPACE that spreads out the stereo field much like Spatializer or SRS audio, although VSPACE seems to be reverb-heavy. As for DOS performance, QUAKEnormally very finicky about sound cards -sounds great, as does WING COMMANDER III. One minor negative is that the MIDI port solidly grabs IRQ 9 and doesn't share it. In addition to the base card, there's a connector for a wavetable daughtercard. Because of the small size of the Base 1, a standard daughtercard hangs out in the air, but Terratec will soon ship a compact version of Yamaha's DB50XG MIDI wavetable card. There's also an optional radio tuner card, which is available separately Overall, the Basel is a solid, inexpensive card that sounds good, scems very compatible, and installs like a dream. For gamers on a budget, this just might be the cat's pajamas. APPEAL: Gamers on a tight budget looking for good sound quality. PROS: Inexpensive, easy installation for both DOS and Windows 95; great sounding digital audio. CONS: Cheesy FM synthesis; odd mounting for wavetable cards.

That's what the Logitech CyberMan 2 is all about-taking you into 3D games with full 3D control. If you can handle the steep learning curve, you'll be rewarded with a much more immersive experience in games like DUKE NUKEM 3D and DESCENI'. The CyberMan 2 is fairly large, with cight buttons on the left and a knob that looks like it should rotate (but doesn't) on the right. It's comfortably heavy, and even in the midst of frenzied action, it stays put. Cyber Man 2 installs in a snap and comes preloaded with several game-specific configurations, including QUAKE and MDK. It's easy to add your own configs: Creating a playable controller for the X. WING VS. TIE FICHIER demo takes less than five minutes. Don't get out all your games, though CyberMan 2 runs only in Windows 95 or a Win-95 DOS box. \"The biggest drawback of the CyberMan 2 is its counter-intuitiveness. The direction controller looks as if it should be spun, but instead you have to tilt it, mudge it, pull it up, or push it down. In a game like DUKE NUKEM, this leads to a lot of initial frustration, as you find yourself looking up instead of moving forward and jumping instead of looking up. If you can stick with it for about two hours, it pays off. Motion in DUKE becomes incredibly fluid. Flying around with the jet-pack becomes almost a game in itself as you smoothly rise, sink, and fly around. Plus, CyberMan 2 is ergonomically friendly, so you don't end a game with numb fingers or a case of joystick clench.\" Unfortunately, the controller is a little too sensitive-even when you're used to it. In DUKE this isn't a big deal, but in Cyber Man's bundled game, DESCENT II: DESTINATION QUARTZON, accidentally looking down flips you over. CyberMan 2 already has sensitivity settings, but could be improved with desensitizing settings 1 f3D shooters like QUAKE and DUKE are your cup of tea, CyberMan 2 is a must-have. If not, the frustration of learning the particular motion of the controller might outweigh your gaming payoff. & APPEAL: Ideal for 3D games and shoot-'em-ups. PROS: Fluid motion; easily programmed. CONS: Oversensitive; at times counterintuitive; steep learning curve. Price: $99 Vendor: Logitech (800) 231-7717 www.logitech.com Reader Service #: 320 RAT CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

"**** REVIEW . VIDEOLOGIC APOCALYPSE 3DX A Different Way HARDWARE by Loyd Case Dfxs Voodoo 3D-accelerator chipset represents a fast, traditional 3D rendering pipeline. But VideoLogic/NEC's PowerVR PCX2 takes a different approach: it breaks the scene up into small pieces, rendering it a piece at a time. A benefit to this approach is PowerVRs ability to do zbuffering on the fly,\" rather than allocating memory for a z-buffer. All 3D display data is then sent via the PCI bus to the 2D boards frame buffer. In a look at Video Logics Apocalypse 3Dx, based on this second-generation PowerVR chip, the results of this novel approach are mixed. PowerVR doesn't support the fog effects rendering errors occur in the last 3D WinBench scene. The Apocalypse 3Dx posts a 69.23D WinBench score on a 200MHz P55C system with an ET-6000based STB Lightspeed 128. Because PowerVR uses the 2D board's frame buffer, a slower 2D board could negatively influence PowerVRs performance. Direct3D apps refuse to run with an early version of the Lightspeed 128 drivers; updating the primary driver enables the PowerVR to run, so make sure you have a working DirectDraw capable card. Games directly ported to the 3Dx look good and run well. ULTIMATE R@CER looks very pretty, but some of the ground textures in MECHWARRIOR I look weak. MDKs built-in performance metric reports a score of 300 in the Direct3D, whereas the DirectDraw version generates a score of 90. Occasional system lockups occur with the PowerVR card-something we didn't see with either Rendition or 3Dfx cards. The Direct3D demo of TERRACIDE runs without any problems, however. The Apocalypse 3Dx generates a decent 3D WinBench score -not as fast as 3Dfx, but faster than most chips, and some of its bundled titles are very sharp. Given recent price drops in 3Dfx cards and the imminent shipment of the RIVA 128, ATI Rage Pro, and Rendition V2200 boards, it remains to be seen how well PowerVR will keep up. Price: $149 (approximate s99 (upgrade APPEAL: 3D Gamers on a budget. PROS: No pass-through cable needed from 2D card; direct ports run great.

Some minor ****REVIEW  SAITEK X36 Flight Done Right HARDWARE The controls themselves are very comfortable. The throttle is probably the nicest design I've seen; its only downside is that the promised detentes weren't noticeable on the early production unit.

Saiteks X36 PC Flight Controller is the first joystick and throttle combiA nation that really gives the old stan dards competition. And at a cost of only $150, it also gives them a run for the money. The X36 system consists of the X36F joystick and the X35T throttle/rudder controller.

The stick can also emulate a CH F-16 Combat Stick The X36edit Windows programming utility is the friendliest I've seen yet (that's relative, as joystick programming software has never been better than mediocre). You're given a list of functions, such as Flaps, Jamming, and Radar Zoom, and you input the key sequences for the sim you're programming. You then assign these functions (instead of the actual key-presses) to various input switches on the stick and throttle. It's a bit of a convoluted process, but it makes fine-tuning your program files much easier when you're looking back-its far more intuitive to alter a function later when you see \"Radar Mode\" rather than \"Alt-R\" APPEAL: Flight sim fans looking for a high quality, flexible HOTAS system that doesn't cost a bundle. PROS: Good programming software; comfortable; individual functions easily disabled. CONS: Extra cable needed to use mouse emulation CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

"**** REVIEW. CAMBRIDGE SOUNDWORKS PC WORKS Such a Deal HARDWARE by Dave Salvator somewhat constricted stereo imaging is much less perceptible. Cambridge has created what may be the shape of things to come: A set of speakers for your PC that will more than fill the bill, and not crimp your budget to pay for it. And while I still would give the nod to Cambridge's Microworks, the PC Works warrants serious consideration if you're budgetchallenged but still want big sound. n the world of audio, you get what you pay for. Or do you? Cambridge Soundworks has revisited that question, and has come up with a speaker system for $100 that should make some $250 systems nervous. And while this system lacks the deep, low-end punch and louder volume of its pricier sibling, the Microworks, it nonetheless delivers impressive PC audio, and is casy on the wallet. PC Works comes in the form of two small satellites and a woofer, but these satellites are even more compact than those found on the Microworks. Setup is painless, and takes all of five minutes. One grumbling point: Though there's a single power supply, its a \"wallwart,\" which eats most of an electric outlet, rather than the preferred \"soap on a rope\" approach. There are two volume adjusters, one to adjust bass volume on the woofer unit, and another (an in-line volume fader) to tweak the overall volume level. Running audio CDs-ranging from Beethoven to Bruce Hornsby -through the PC works, the overall sound quality is very clean, with well-defined highs, clear mids, and solid bass. With the sound card mixer's faders at about 75 percent, the PC Works distorts at about 70 percent maximum volume. But backing the control off a bit produces reasonably loud, clean imaging. The only complaint is that the PC Works' stereo field feels\"focused,\" and is very much contained within the physical space between the two satellite units. In a comparison with the Microworks, the PC Works' high-end has comparable clarity and definition, though the PC Works' low-end and maximum volume are clearly not as strong Caming audio in shooters and flight sims is solid, with more-than-adequate bass on explosions, and a clear high-end. In gaming audio uses, the PC Works APPEAL: Gamers who desire champagne-quality sound on a Budweiser budget. PROS: Great sound for the money. CONS: Lacks clean low-end at higher volumes; wall-wart power supply. Price: $99 Vendor: Cambridge Soundworks (800) 367-4434, www.hifi.com Reader Service #: 323 RATED ***** REVIEW . PANASONIC 24X ATAPI CD-ROM DRIVE The X Factor HARDWARE by Greg Fortune here seems to be a trend developing in the marketing of certain types of computer hardware. Rather than reporting what a device is capable of on a consistent basis, many companies have begun advertising the performance of a part based on the absolute maximum performance of the equipment, the kind of performance that you will rarely see during real-world usc, Particularly guilty of this have been CD ROM manufacturers, who would like you to believe that their drive will give you 16x 18x, or higher performance. In actuality, these drives provide far less performance, peaking at that level only occasionally. So guess what we found when we tested Panasonics new 24x drive.... Price: $209 Installation of this drive was painless Vendor: Panasonic (800) 726-2797 under Windows 95, and the drive lives up www.panasonic.com to its claim of working while mounted Reader Service #: 324 l on its sicle--a nice touch. whopping 85 percent with an impressive access time consistently just about 100 milliseconds. Panasonics 24x CD-ROM does have very good performance, as long as the data is being read in large blocks from the outer tracks on the CD. However, gaming requires more flexibility than that. Buy a crive designed to give you all-around high performance, not one tweaked so that \"24x» could be written on the box Our WinBench 97 CD-ROM tests were run from a Pentium 166 machine with an Intel Bus-Mastering PCI EIDE controller. We expected to see about 16x performance overall, which is roughly what the drive delivered. The WinBench 97 CD-ROM tests came in at an average of 1,100 on two different machines, with the highlights being sequential throughput scores that averaged in thc 2,500s and peaked at 3,500KB/sec transferred (when reading from the outer tracks only). Every give has some take, and this drive took it in the shorts performing random reads. The average throughput for randomly accessed reads averaged a scant 86KB/sec, not exactly stellar performance. CPU utilization was generally around 40 percent during the random reacls, but remember those blazing sequential transfer rates? During high-speed sequential transfers the CPU utilization shot up to a APPEAL: Gamers who prefer fast installs to smooth game-play. PROS: Blazing sequential transfer speeds. >CONS: Random access transfer speeds tank; chunky game-play; high CPU utilization. RATED CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

They are called \"action\" games, but with developed characters and a better story. Action games don't need a story. All you do is progress through levels and kill, kill, kill, anyway. I was very impressed, though, by your article in the August issue about ION Storm's ANACHRONOX. The fact that Tom Hall made his team play CHRONO TRIGGER before starting work on [ANACHRONOX] would have been exactly how I would have done it. I hope that game companies read this and follow in the footsteps of Square, makers of the best true RPGs ever. -Aaron P LOW COASTER OF THE MONTH Since its release, DIABLO has been addressed as an RPG. Though a good game, it is not worthy of the RPG title. DIABLO is basically a third-person shooter (as is CRUSADER: NO REMORSE) with a developed character. There is more to an RPG than character. Back when RPGs were genuine, they had a very complex world, if not worlds, to travel through. They had the famous battle sequence that relied on skill and thought, rather than reflexes. Several people were in your party at most times. Most of all, there was a story. These elements that make up the game go hand in hand, and should not be separated.

"***** REVIEW DA: PURSUIT OF JUSTICE DIFFICULTY LEVEL ADVENTURE/RPG No Appeal Three Games in the D.A.: PURSUIT OF JUSTICE Series Is Too Much Law & Order for Anyone by Charles Ardai The Sward to D atot justice pursair of justice S wiss The Outlying pursuit of justice ta recent high-school reunion, it seemed to me that everyone I talked to had become a lawyer. No supermodels, no computergame designers, no presidents of the United States. Enough attorneys, though, to staff a president's cabinet, his supreme court, and his personal legal-defense fund. This either bodes really well or really badly for a game series like Legacy Softwares DA.: PURSUIT OF JUSTICE. DA. casts you as an up-and-coming prosecutor in the office of Los Angeles District Attorney Frank Jarrett. To take over Jarrett's job, you've got to prove yourself by getting convictions in three increasingly difficult cases. The gimmick here, as in Sierra's long-running POLICE QUEST series, is that the gameplay is procedurally realistic. No Perry Mason theatricality; no quaint, Matlock-like charming of the jury-just textbook law of the sort you'd find in a law school classroom. Judging by the apparent appeal of law school to my fellow alums, such an approach might be a popular one. In practice, though, I wonder whom this game will appeal to. Not everyone who goes to law school wants to practice law, but I suspect that everyone who wants to practice law does go to law school. For a lawyer or a law student, playing DA. would be as much of a busmans holiday as playing a POLICE QUEST game would be for a cop And while I can imagine a casual John Crishamn reader getting excited if the game featured conspiratorial legal skullcluggery, how excited will be get when he discovers that his first case focuses on a drunk driver arrested for plowing into a bus stop bench? treba The Red Bottes cessful) game called IN THE IST DEGREE.

That's what this is like. None of the cases here is good enough to stand on its own; to the extent that the game is appealing, its largely because of the development of your career over the course of several cases. The first, THE SUNSET BOULEVARD DEUCE, is the drunk driving case, and it's almost laughably introductory. The second, THE GATSBY DIAMOND JEWELRY THEFT, raises the stakes, but only a little: Atheftinclined debutante steals a car and the diamond necklace it contains. The last, THE RAT TATTOO MURDER, finally wakes you up with a bit of homicide, but even this case isn't great courtroom drama, The full game (the series) comes on eight CDs, and with tax it will cost you about a hundred dollars.

The tools include a terrific interface for ordering a variety of tests on evidence (such as fingerprint, handwriting, or chemical analysis) and for constructing a legal case, by selecting specific pieces of data as being relevant toward supporting the assertions you'll need to make in court. In the drunk driving case, for instance, you have to choose separate pieces of evidence to support your assertions that it was the defendant who was driving, that he was driving a motor vehicle, that he was drunk, and so on. However, when you visit the scene of the crime, it's just a still photo of the location-you don't get to interact with the scenery in any way. In 1ST DEGREE, you conducted interrogations yourself, selecting which questions to ask a witness. Here, the interrogations have already been conducted and videotaped by the police, and all you get to decide is which videotape to watch. And, in practice, you have to watch all of them. Similarly, in the police evidence room, you basically have to pick up all available pieces of evidence and scan them into your \"Case Constructor.\" Because you have to click on not some, but all, the videotapes and not some, but all, the evidence, D.A. often feels less like a game than a mechanical exercise. The ticking clock imposes some urgency-days slip away unbelievably quickly, and you get only four before you have to go to trialbut otherwise the game feels automatic. It's also arbitrary: Why the maximum of 20 facts in the Case Constructor? In what real-world case would a prosecutor have to choose between two equally important facts because he wasn't allowed to go to court with 21? Perry Mason must be spinning in his grave.

"MEAT PUPPET. REVIEW whelmed and coordinate withering group attacks. A host of environmental hazards, including wicked whips, fire jets, and ridiculously gigantic guns add to the challenge. ACTION SHOCKING BEHAVIOR Recharging Lotos' armor is a simple matter of finding a blasted fuse box and indulging in a little self-electrocution. KILLER MOVES Keyboard commands or a combination of mouse and keyboard can be configured to maneuver Lotos. But since the mouse is used for shooting in both, mouse mode is the only practical option, since the need to hold down multiple keys while whipping the mouse around will challenge any gamer lacking a prehensile tongue. While Lotos can front and backflip, as well as roll to either side, she has significantly fewer movement options than the CRUSADER hero. Since Lotos finishes rolls by facing a slightly different direction and standing upright again, rolling across rooms and using cover isn't an option. Finicky controls also make lining up jumps frequently frustrating Shooting is simple: The mouse's targeting reticle turns red over any destructible object. Click the mouse and fire. The main drawback here is when enemies get obscured by a column, yet are still in Lotos' line of fire. The reticle won't target them no matter what, apparently secing\" only the column, which isn't destructible. In these cases, enemies can shoot away without fear of retaliation. tion, but at a price--recharging it requires electrocuting Lotos and taking some damage. With the Martinet threatening to kill her if she doesn't assassinate quickly, Lotos is in a literal race against time. While this adds a definite sense of urgency to the game, it also proves to be its biggest drawback Gamers intent on blowing away everything and getting vr wru wll likely nin out of time and die. You'll have to leave a lot of creatures alive, but does anyone really play this sort of game without intending to indulge in a bloodbath? This time constraint is compounded by the sprawl of the gameworld. The embassies are huge, and frequently confusing, and backtracking is often required. Included maps will speed your journey, but shortchange playing time. Every room presents unique challenges, but you'll find yourself skipping the unnecessary ones while racing dual clocks for multiple assignments. An option to shut off the clock is definitely in order TERRIBLE TANDEM Carry out all your assassinations and you'll get to square off against the Martinet and his little buddy. With luck you won't end up another bloody splotch on the wall. ctact BEAT THE CLOCK And shoot they will, for the action in Mear PUPPET is nonstop.

"**** REVIEW  CARMAGEDDON ACTION DIFFICULTY LEVEL Let the Blood Fly Could Interplay's Gory Racer Be the Ultimate Racing Game? by Peter Olafson CP | LKE 1/2 WASTED 0/5 2250 PROFIT 7/229 KILLS IIA 11150 CREDITS STUNT BONG omewhere along that stretch of country lighway, between plowing through a herd of cattle and discovering that my roadster wouldn't make that monster loop-de-loop, it occurred to me: It's been a long time since a driving game has been as much fun as CARMACEDDON. This racer is like DUKE NUKEM 3D, as played from insicle a serrated pseudoCorvette. It's got the gibs, its got the piquant detail, and its got the personality. You're one of six participants in 36 open-ended races carved out of five brawny 3D worlds (city streets, the beach, the American West, an Aspenlike snowy hideaway, and a treacherous factory) where speeds surpass 300 kph. 2 06 STEAK TONIGHT? CARMAGEDDON's most hilarious feature is the comedic excess of violence. You gain bonuses for the more outrageous displays of gore and mayhem. MACED There's very little not to like about CARMAGEDDON. It has a range of aggressive opponents; a great, crunchy metal score and a symphony of sound effects; pointed and profane commentary from your Jay Leno-like driver; and small touches like skidmarks, bloody tire-marks, and delicate handling on grass and underwater. It also has a richness of off-road scenery and free-form structure I haven't seen sincc TEST DRIVE III-a relief after the raft of recent «trough\" racers. I expect someone, somewhere, will make a fuss about the violence. It won't be me. While this would be a good racing game without the gore, it would be just a racing game, instead of the silly, magnificent black comedy it has become. CARMAGEDDON could also be a bit cleaner. The hi-res DOS version simply didn't work on my Pentium rigs. On later tracks, the game had a tendency to freeze-sometimes for just a few seconds and sometimes for good. And, on one machine, invoking the comical replay mode sometimes seemed like daring the game to crash. But the few problems I had with CARMAGEDDON never overrode its addictiveness, nor stopped me from playing, and I wound up answering cach crash of the program with a dozen soaring ones of my own. CARMAGEDDON IS the kind of game that most racing titles only wish they were: the fun kind. & FOUR WAYS TO THE FINISH LINE How you win is up to you.

"***** REVIEW. TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 4 De Tony the Tired DIFFICULTY LEVEL INTERMEDIATE Stormfront's TONY LA RUSSA 4 May Need Some Time on the Bench by Jim Gindin TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 4. the latest version of Stormfront Studios' wellregarded baseball simulation, is an exercise in frustration. I found myself surprised by its ability to produce fairly realistic numbers in a very short amount of time. I was pleased with its attempt to provide full league support, a complete fantasy draft, and career play with a hint of minor-league development. But I was irritated with slow arcade play, sloppy stat-keeping, and an inability to blend rookie careers with established Major Leaguers. There's quite a range of function here, some of it implemented with surprising depth, but inconsistency spoils the overall package. MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH LA RUSSA 4's batting model is a little better than most arcade baseball games, with a balanced sense of timing that should keep you deep in the count. CONVOM KURSE you'll be a split second late to make con play. If the ball is out of reach, however, tact. Because of this, LA RUSSA 4 is the computer runners are off to the races. only arcade game I've played where Fly balls between outfielders consistentfound myself going deep into the count l y drop for easy triples. On more than against the computer pitcher. If the pitch one occasion, I've seen a batter bunt the is in the strike zone, and your swing is well ball past the pitcher and the second timed, you'll almost certainly make conbaseman into the right side of the infield, tact. Tliere really isn't a sense of great before it finally came to rest a little way contact versus mediocre contact, and ball into right-center field. Switching to the direction and distance are more a reflec correct fielder can take time, as can tion of the hitter's profile than an under sending the second baseman out to standing of plysics. But, all in all, if it retrieve the ball.

The pitchers and hitters look very realistic, with movielike animation of the warmup, windup, and swing. There's no differentiation among players, however, except for uniform and skin color.    \"The fielding interface is not as good.

In LA RUSSA 4, the pitchcr begins the play by selecting from one to four available pitches. Crosshairs appear in the strike zone, then there's an endless amount of toe-tapping and batter shuffling while the pitcher waits to begin his windup. You can move the crosshairs to direct the pitch until slightly after the pitcher releases the ball. The pitch leads toward the selected area, affected by the pitcher's fatigue and his control rating. For the most part, pitches look fairly realistic sliders suddenly drop as they approach the plate, and curveballs bend slowly, according to their spin. But fastballs, change ups, and slicers never move from side to side, and a hanging curveball or slider is treated exactly like a belt-high change up. Hitting, as in most games, is an exercise in timing a button-press as the pitch approaches the plate.

"TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 4. REVIEW ond baseman's toss back to the pitcher goes straight to the mound, rather than where the pitcher is standing after failing to field the bunt. SPORTS other leagues. When simulating, it does a fair job assigning playing time, though there's a tendency to overuse the top setup reliever and no ability to set lineups beyond providing one against left-handed pitching and one against right-hande d pitching. Even if your league is using the designated hitter and you have one in your pre-set lineups, simulated games will not use him, making stars like Edgar Martinez completely useless. That's almost certainly where the 1 V2-run American League deficit comes in. LA RUSSA also includes a fantasy draft module and the ability to trade against computer teams. It's easy to grab stars from opposing teams by offering up several mediocre players, however, and the computer does not draft particularly well. I was able to draft a 120-game winning team without preparation while going against the 27 computer managers. While the computer teams seemed to understand who the superstars were, they had trouble telling a mediocre middle reliever from a solid starting pitcher. versions still appear here. The graphics display, state-of-the-art with LA RUSSA 3, is slow and behind the times. The extra modules, which should provide a lot of entertainment value for relatively little programming complexity, still don't work properly. If you own any version of LA Russa baseball created in the last three years, you won't find this much of an upgrade. It's a shame, because with so many mediocre titles out there, this should have been the time for a mature product to shine. LA RUSSA 4 brings the series close to a demotion to the minor leagues. TAKE A NUMBER Statistically speaking, LA RUSSA 4 is virtually identical to its predecessors. It simulates games fairly quickly, and is easily capable of finishing a 2,000-game season in 15 minutes. The numbers are far better than any of the other arcade games on the market, but still fall short of the text-based games. Offense numbers are a little lower than in real life, especially in the American League, where the games average about 1 1/2 runs less per game than real 1996 numbers. Most seasons feature one player breaking the alltime home run record. Was this built into the game to add excitement? Pitching is not simulated quite as well, with little interest in individual home run or walk totals. For which pitches a player is rated is almost random, Randy Johnson, the game's most feared strikeout artist, isn't rated for the slider, which many think is even nastier than his fastball. LA RUSSA 4 lets you create leagues with varying division sizes and numbers of teams. It can create new schedules for these leagues and import teams from APPEAL: Baseball fans who want a taste of everything, without requiring a great amount of depth. Fans who don't have either of the last two LA RUSSA releases. PROS: Good statistical simulator; decent support for league play; fairly realistic gameplay. CONS: Mind-numbingly slow speed on lower-end machines; statistics deteriorate in career play; poor understanding of baseball's dimensions; many errors in tracking stats.

In fact, GRAND SLAM has the look and feel of a console game-and while there's nothing wrong with a good arcade simulation of the national pastime, GRAND SLAM offers none of the sophistication of its ever-growing list of competitors. The game is attractive, especially on systems with 3D acceleration, and graphically shows the different body types among the players. Albert Belle, for example, offers a much stockier silhouette than a Brady Anderson. Batters blow bubbles, call time, or groan at a bad call. Pitchers do their part too, shaking off signals and scooping dirt from the mound. It's a shame that CRAND SLAM'S viewing angles aren't more flexible, as I'd enjoy seeing what the rest of the players might be up to in the field.

May ANCO eveloped in Britain by ANCO Software, KICKOFF 97 is the second title of the year from Maxis new sports line, and this one is a beauty The game has two critical attributes that none of its recent competitors can boast: razor-sharp artificial intelligence and gameplay so intense it will make your head spin and your fingers numb. If you're looking for soccer action at its digital best, you've come to the right place. Playable from either DOS or Windows 95, KICKOFF 97 supports resolutions up to 640x480 and a 256-color depth. Although the game makes no use of accelerated hardware, it doesn't need to you'll experience absolutely manic game speed and fluid animation, even on systems below the recommended minimum requirements. At last, a game that doesn't penalize gamers with limited resources. KICKOFF99 FOOTIE CAM Gamers can view the action in KickOFF 97 from 36 different camera angles, which should let you see exactly how the game's killer Al just kicked your butt. mode cuts unprepared human players absolutely zero slack. Price: $39.95 Minimum System Requirements: Pentium 75 or faster for Windows 95 or 486DX2-66 for DOS, 16MB RAM for Win 95 or 8MB RAM for DOS, SVGA graphics, 60MB hard-disk space for Win 95 or 50MB for DOS, 2x CD-ROM drive, mouse, joystick; supports Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards. Multiplayer Support: Hotseat (1-2 players) Designer: ANCO Software Publisher: Maxis Sports Walnut Creek, CA (800) 33-MAXIS www.maxis.com Reader Service #: 336 TEAM PLAYER The game's national and international rosters include more than 300 teams, comprised of more than 5,200 players. There's no official license, however, so don't bother looking for your favorite soccer star here. A player editor lets you change names and uniform appearance, but not positions or skill levels. You can also create your own Dream Teams, picking the top players from all available leagues. Came modes include practice, single friendly matches, 30-round league challenge, and national World Cup playoffs. There's no online multiplayer or LAN support, but the game can be played head-to-head on one computer. Unlike in many other soccer games, the practice mode isn't just a lame menu option here. KICKOFF 97's practice mode is a full-blown tutorial of soccer mechanics that includes passing and receiving, dribbling and shooting, penalty kicks, goal keeping, cross-ins, corner kicks, and free kicks. When you think you've mastered them all, you can test your skills in the decathlon-style tournament practice. And make no mistake -you'll need plenty of practice to face the game's outstanding computer-controlled players. Though artificial intelligence can be a somewhat intangible quality to measure, this game's Al will kick an average player's butt all over the field. With almost no exceptions, the computer-controlled competition is fast, precise, and utterly ruthless in its charge on your goal. There are no skill levels to speak of, other than the overall quality of the team you're matched against. Arcade mode plays a little loosely, but simulation BUMP AND GRIND On-field graphics are sparse, but well designed. Players are composed of texture-mapped polygons, motion-captured to a fault. The range of realistic player movements is a sight to behold. Victims of brutal tackles typically languish on the turf for several seconds, as if reeling in pain or at least shaking the stars from their heads. Others may stand up and begin pushing or fighting, joined by other hotheaded players. When the referee issues a yellow or red flag, offending players vehemently argue the penalty. Goalkeepers bemoan each missed block and even appear to point an accusing finger at their teammates. In other words, the animation is fluid and surprisingly diverse. Player control is tight and responsive using a joystick (digital or analog), keyboard, or mouse. A variety of command combinations lets you perform a host of CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

"***** REVIEW PGA TOUR PRO SPORTS Tp Hook Shot DIFFICULTY LEVEL EA Sports' Latest Gets No Eagles by Scott A. May #11 Par 4 n case you haven't noticed, it's boom time on the digital greens, as more golf sims than ever vie for space on your computer screen. Yet beyond new graphic engines, improved physics models, and multiplayer capabilities, most publishers prefer to play it safe than to tinker with success. Such is the case with EA Sports' PGA TOUR PRO, a solid, but rather conventional, Win 95 update to the company's venerable golf franchise. In a nutshell, this game will neither disappoint nor inspire. 10 mph To pin: 120 yds sit below Lle: Fairway (Sidebill) IN A SQUARE GROOVE Just as SIMGOLF and FRONT PAGE SPORTS: Golf are trying new swing meters, PGA gives up its unique swing for a standard circular meter SPORTE FAMILIAR SET OF CLUBS EA Sports may have lost its cutting cdge in the football, soccer, and basketball arenas but, as most fans will be happy to find, it's nearly impossible to screw up an already good golf simula tion. Aside from a few new graphic 520 flourishes-including a revamped interface and ambient animation the design team sticks with the boilerplate design that made the previous DOS versions so palatable. Originally packaged with only two 18hole courses, TPC of Scottsdale and Bay Hill Club, this version adds the Price: $49.99 Peach Beach course disk as a bonus. Minimum System The game is also compatible with older Requirements: P75 (P133 recomDOS-based courses including TPC at mended), Windows 95, Sawgrass, Spyglass Hill, TPC at Avenel, 16MB RAM, 60MB free and Spanish Bay. Game modes include hard-disk space, SVGA practice, stroke, tournament, skins, and graphics, 4x CD-ROM, mouse; requires shoot-out, and are playable with up to DirectX-compatible four people via modem, LAN, or EA's sound and video cards; free Internet sports network. As many as modem. 20 foursomes can compete in online Multiplayer Support: tournaments. Logging on to EA Sports LAN or Internet (1-4 players). Net is a no-brainer, finding available Design: EA Sports Internet competition, however, proves Publisher: much more difficult. Electronic Arts Course graphics are suitably photoSan Mateo, CA (800) 448-8822 realistic. Rendered in realtime, the www.ea.com instant screen updates employ EA's proReader Service #: 337 | prietary Flash Draw technology. Motion-captured digital golfers are set against a backdrop of textured polygons and sprite-based graphics, boasting a maximum 800x600 resolution and 16-bit color depth. MMX support is provided, as well as DirectPlay, but otherwise the game requires no special 3D hardware or software acceleration. Overall graphics quality is good, although a low polygon tile count makes the foregrounds appcar slightly flat, and thus they lack the illusion of depth. If you are familiar with the PGA TOUR series, you'll find some new touches to gameplay. You can walk the course in realtime to read the greens. Individual hole fly-bys, augmented with audio commentary, let you map your pending strategies. There's even a special«risk meter\" to gauge the difficulty of your upcoming shot. On the downside, EA has changed their once-unique swing overlay to a more traditional circular meter. If Win 95 online gaming is your prime consideration, PGA TOUR PRO is worth the upgrade. Otherwise, stick with EA's previous DOS-based PGA TOUR titles, which are still among the best in the business LAG A LITTLE This shot shows one of PGA TOUR's assets: reading the greens in realtime. APPEAL: PC golfers, especially those who enjoyed the earlier PGA TOUR games. PROS: Smart, clean interface; good course selection; choice of three multiplayer modes. CONS: Adds little to an overcrowded genre; high system requirements. RATED CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

"F-22  REVIEW modeling, multiplayer support, and a thorough, well-written manual. Unfortunately, for some players, the frame rate problems render the game annoying at best and downright unplayable at worst. If I-Magic can address the frame rate problems and fix the 3D accelerator stutters, IF-22 could prove to be a standout start for Interactive Magic's simulations division & TEETHING PAINS The product is very stable, but does suffer from some problems. The redout/blackout model needs work During a redout only the outside view (not the cockpit avionics) is blocked; though this only occurs when playing on a non-3Dfx-based system. Blackouts develop in sudden spurts, rather than smoothily progressing through tunnel vision to CLOC (C-induced loss of consciousness). Dogfighting is further hampered by the simulated pilots poor G tolerance. Any exposure over 96 results in a blackout. Worse, the blackout doesn't immediately clear upon reduction of Cs. Fortunately, the setup options let you disable redouts and blackouts. iF-22s padlock view is a perfect example of the wrong way to implement a padlock view. The padlock contains numerous \"holes,\" or areas where it is impossible to tell which way you're looking. To resolve this, the HUD display contains a snall icon in one of the upper comers that tells you in which direction to fly in order to bring your nose to the target. The icon works, but it's sometimes difficult to see. Also, you can't padlock a target unless you've first managed a radar lock. You can't padlock an attacking bandit until you've already out-maneuvered him. Finally, instead of smoothing panning and tracking the target, the padlock jumps, as if it were automatically switching between fixed views The graphics engine, however, caused the most constemation. Using a Pentium Pro 200 and a 4MB 3D Blaster, I found IF22 to be very slow. Disabling the 3D accelerator support actually improves frame rate and reduces the number of pauses; however, it caused the terrain graphics to pixelate badly at low altitude. Testing iF-22 on two Pentium 166 systems equipped with 3Dfx cards, however, resulted in extremely s mooth frame rates in 2D mode on both systems, even at 800x600 resolution. Running on the 3D card resulted in slower performance on both systems, with one system exhibiting extremely jerky frame rates and pauses at points during flight, especially soon after takeoff. IF-22 has a lot of things going for it, such as the campaign engine, flight SIMULATIONISPACE APPEAL: Sim players looking for a more serious F-22 simulation than previous efforts; fans of dynamic campaign engines. PROS: The most plausible F-22 flight model yet; superb dynamic campaign engine; accurate terrain modeling.

"***** REVIEW  DECISIVE BATTLES OF WWII: THE ARDENNES OFFENSIVE DIFFICULTY LEVEL The Last Bulge? SSG and SSI Join Forces for the Best Bulge Ever STRATEGYZWARGAMES by Jim Cobb long with Gettysburg, Waterloo, and Stalingrad, the Battle of the Bulge is a very popular, yet difficult gaming subject. The Bulge presents designers not only with the problems of comparisons with older games and historical accuracy but also with supply gained, even doubled, by the actions of units in supply. However, supply is, in itself, a function of OPs, because a unit must be in supply to receive them. Supply is determined by the number of OPs a unit would expend to reach either a supply dump or a mobile supply source. Thus, OPs create an interlocking relationship with movement and terrain, limiting a units latitude of action. Factors such as time also figure into supply (see the sidebar). The Attack and Defense Combat Capabilities (NDCC) are separate, but still dependent on supply and terrain OPS. A unit expends all ACCs in attack and must be in supply to renew them, although an out-of-supply unit will not lose ACCs until it attacks. As scenarios go on, German supply drops from 100 percent and American supply increases, so ACCs available are a function of overall supply status, and not a constant.

Cirulis he nice thing about wargames is that for every company that thinks slicker, faster, simpler clones are the road to success, there is a designer somewhere who thinks that complexity and realism are a better route to a good game. In this case, as other companies rush to make more accessible (simpler) versions of COMMAND & CONQUER, Windward Studios, in partnership with publisher Head Cames, has created its own C&C-forgrownups title, ENEMY NATIONS, which sticks with the ever-popular real-time format, all the while offering a slightly more complex and realistic resource and combat model.

Well, now you have not one, but two opportunities to realize those celluloid dreams, STEVEN SPIELBERG'S DIRECTOR'S CHAIR (DC) lets you craft movies in the manner of the famed filmmaker, while in Carey DeVuonos HOLLYWOOD MOGUL you play Executive Producer, running an entire film studio well, the same complaint has often been leveled at many of Spielberg's films. MOCUL lacks the multimedia splendor of DC, jazzing its text-heavy screens with colorful static backgrounds. There are some similarities, in that both DC and MOGUL utilize an attractive assistant to keep you informed and, it's hoped, out of trouble. But even here, the differences abound. DC gives you singular choices: Every game features the same assistant, the same production studio. MOGUL no only lets you select your assistant, choose from a number of studio-fanfare WAV files, and design your own studio logo, it also lets you import.BMP files so that your girlfriend, husband, or grandmother can be in the game. D DC concems itself with the nuts and bolts of filmcraft, while MOGUL gives you the big picture. Each concept is a solid one for a game, but the games differ greatly in how they realize their potential. In DC, you are actually on the set shooting scenes and dealing directly with actors. As director, you aren't allowed to choose your actorsyou don't yet command Spielbergs clout. But this also cuts down on your gameplay choices, especially since the acting quality is so uneven. Jennifer Aniston (from the hit TV show Friends) is very photogenic, and delivers about what you'd expect. But why Quentin Tarantino was chosen as one of the \"actors\" for this game is a mystery, one that ranks right up there with the miscasting of Bruce Willis in Bonfire of the Vanities.

While both games are accessible, DC is obviously aimed at people who don't normally play games. There's nothing wrong with that, and DC does begin nicely: The feeling that you get when Steven Spielberg walks on screen and talks to you is as warm and fuzzy as watching the video of ET. If it's a little sappy, APPEAL: For die-hard Spielberg fans only. PROS: Lush production values; warm and friendly Spielberg; Jennifer Aniston. CONS: So limited and linear that it ultimately fails as both game and multimedia. FATHER FIGURE Following in Steven Spielberg's footsteps is fine to a point, but it's so overdone that DIRECTOR'S CHAIR suffers as a game. CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

At times, he's downright painful to watch. |   Hollywood Movie Studio YOU MAKE THE CALL In MOGUL, you do everything from buying the script and selecting the location of the film shoot, to choosing the actors, the producer, and the director. And while this process lacks DC's visceral appeal (such as Ms. Aniston's sunbathing), Mocul puts you right in the middle of the moviemaking game. You may, for example, negotiate with a certain fonner Austrian bodybuilder to determine whether or not he has casting approval, how many stunts he will personally perform, and if he will he settle for limo service to and from the set or require a 24-hour chauffeur. About the only thing missing is having to remove brown M&Ms from the bowl. Every actor, producer, and director in MOGUL is rated for a variety of tendencies: star appeal, ego, ability to stay within budget, work ethic, and artistic vision. The best are, of course, the most expensive. From the time the negotiations begin, you have to juggle a lot of factors before your movie can become a hit: Go Inside the Dream Factory Should I go for a veteran actor no could challenge you with tough decisions, longer at the top of the box-office heap, it irritates you instead.

"ELLIOTT CHIN ACTION Hero: Miyamoto A Tribute to One of the Greatest Game Designers of All Time (1989), and LAST EXPRESS — didn't play a Mario game until MARIO 64; nevertheless, he credits Miyamoto with inspiration:\"Both [KARATEKA and PRINCE OF PERSIA relied on a rescue-the-princess storyline, and DONKEY KONG was the first game that had the princess theme.\" Mechner says that he pumped countless quarters into DONKEY KONG, and that his dream for his month, READ.ME features a list of CGWand Gamespots Most Influential Game Designers of all time. As our staffs mulled over the list, I brought up the name of a man who has never designed a single PC game: Shigeru Miyamoto. Many of you won't know him, but he is Japan's greatest game designer and Nintendo's ace in the hole in the next-generationconsole battle. He probably is the world's best-selling game designer, with literally dozens of games to his credit and combined sales that total more than 100 mil lion units. The reason you don't know him is that as Nintendos premier designer, he designs console games only. 0011004007650 A GORILLA NAMED DONKEY KONG Miyamoto's first game was DONKEY KONC, which was released in 1981, at a time when video games were primitive. In games like ASTEROIDS and SPACE INVADERS, you simply shot at an everincreasing number of aliens on a neverchanging screen. DONKEY KONC, though, created a quiet revolution in the arcades because it gave you a human persona (a plumber named Mario), a lccring adversary (Donkey Kong), and a goal (the rescue of your girlfriend). DONKEY KONG also employed the concept of levels: Once you defcated one level, you moved onto a totally new arena of challenges. The challenges weren't shooting and killing, either, but defensive skills like jumping and dodging. Both Mario and Donkey Kong also had personality: Mario in the way he ran and jumped, and Donkey Kong in his chest-pounding tantrums. It all seems unspectacular now, but in 1981, it was amazing The effect on today's designers, who were then just kids or teens in the arcades, is telling Jordan Mechner--the designer of KARATEKA (1984), PRINCE OF PERSIA Shigeru Miyamoto is the one person who could be considered a God of Game Design. L-01 CHORUST 3500 LARES ACOLOSSE -Tom Hall, cofounder of id Software and ION Storm GENESIS DONKEY KONG put Nintendo and Miyamoto on the gaming map. B OX CONSOLES VS. COMPUTERS Now, before you old-timers get in an uproar and turn the page, consider this: PC games don't exist in a vacuum, and many PC developers play and love console games. James Phinney, one of STARCRAFT's designers, says, \"At Blizzard, console games and arcade games have a big impact on what we think is cool. I've always thought of that as one of our strengths.\" It's no coincidence that the best game designers on the PC have all played video games, especially Shigeru Miyamoto classics such as MARIO 64, LEGEND OF ZELDA, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, and DONKEY Kong. For someone who has yet to design for the PC, Miyamoto has influenced the PC industry as few other designers have. years was to create a computer game as good as an arcade game.\" Miyamoto's early work influenced C even the strategy side of PC game design.

PRAZE hile gamers are drowning in a sea of real-time strategy clones, Blue Byte Software is offering a breath of fresh air with a unique new game Incubation: Time is Running Out. It's an exciting and novel treatment of the classic turn-based strategy game that's sure to be a hit, because it's both original and a blast to play. Incubation is the latest chapter in Blue Byte's successful Battle Isle saga. You must lead a squad of marines against the aggressive man-eating Scay'Ger on the planet Scayra. The missions in Incubation are quite different from those found in the traditional hex-based games. The battles are not fought in large open fields, but rather in the dark and complex industrial buildings of the colony Scay-Hallwa. You'll need to rely on your tactical skills rather than strategic planning, as the fast paced action produces constantly changing conditions. For example: during a battle Scay'Ger might start dropping down from the ceiling, jumping out from behind closed doors or even coming up through the floor! In the specially designed multi-player levels, deathmatches against up to three other squads can be fought over the Internet, a LAN or via a play-by-mail system. Snap decisions are easily put into action with the intuitive user interface. The interface allows you to stay focused on the task at hand instead of digging through the manual in the middle of a fight. Watch your orders being carried out from almost anywhere you can imagine with a freefloating mouse-controlled camera. Put your tactical skills to the test against the vicious and cunning Scay'Ger in over 30 turn-based missions ! wed ACELLO, INCUBATION INFORMATION Time is running out, so call (800) 933-2983 for your FREE playable demo.

And out a few degrees beyond a they will only get better. How Real Can You Get? After you finally get a taste of visual range dogfighting and examine how it compares to sims, an obvious question arises: How realistic can PC air-combat sims ultimately become? Flight and systems modeling clearly have the potential to be 100 percent accurate someday, and the feel conveyed by a good force feedback joystick, throttle, and rudder pedal combination can bring you surprisingly close to the real thing. \"Seat of the pants\" inputs, however, are impossible to simulate on a simple PC. Flying a sim is harder than it should be without this source of information, but most sim pilots eventually learn to use visual cues as substitutes for these physical stimuli. I believe the limits of proficiency for this can approach reality, but only if sim designers help gamers make this translation by providing easy access to key data such as airspeed and aircraft attitude. The biggest disadvantage of PC flight sims is the comparatively poor situational awareness they provide with their cockpit view systems. SVGA-graphics resolutions degrade visual acuity and peripheral vision, and costeffective VR headsets are not yet available to do proper head tracking. It's currently impossible to give the kind of situational awareness you get in a real cockpit. Sim designers (and gamers) seem divided into two camps along a familiar line: form versus function. Those who emphasize a realistic look tend to rely on \"virtual cockpit\" panning views, while those who focus on giving the gamer a realistic amount of information are willing to accept a more artificial appearance, such as in AIR WARRIOR's large set of overlapping, wide-angle fixed views (shamelessly duplicated in WARBIRDS, FIGHTER SQUADRON, and JANE's F-15). The hope is that one day, increasing screen resolutions and continued innovation will bring the two sides together in a system that not only looks real, but also provides a realistic field of view, well-defined images that indicate target facing and closure rates at realistic distances, a means to communicate precisely in which direction you're looking, and a simple and intuitive way to search for and track targets.

We were going to start with the basics-High Yo-Yos, lead turns, and lag tums. There were no bruised egos-when Cluck Yeager flew Sky Warriors a few years back, he had to start at the same stage. Besides, even the most experienced sim pilots will find that the physical sensations and situational awareness in a real plane add so much to the equation that things work very differently from sim flying, THE WILD BLUE We suited up, headed out to the flight line, and boarded our T-34As. Despite the small size of the ex-military trainers, the cockpits were fairly roomy. The bubble canopies afforded a superb view (canopy frames, so obtrusive in games like WARBIRDS, can easily be looked around). When you fly with Sky Warriors, you control only the stick and rudder; after an expensive incident with a blown engine a few years back, the group decided to allow the safety pilot to handle the throttle. After takeoff, we made a nontypical run over downtown Atlanta to fly formation with a banner-towing Super Cub. This proved quite challenging for the safety pilots, trying to fly close formation at full flaps while the T-34s hung on a stall so as not to leave the full-throttle Super Cub in our trails. In our later flying, we could maintain formation with very small (0.5 to 1 inch) stick inputs, but during this low-speed maneuver, I could see the control stick moving through a 7to 8-inch range After we broke off and cleaned up the airplane, the safely pilots put us in formation and passed off the sticks to the front-seaters. Because it's not glamorous (unless the Thunderbirds or Blue Angels are doing it), formation flying is neglected in most siins SABRE ACE being the notable exception. Still, it's extremely challenging and exciting in its own right. Hanging a few feet off the wingtip of another T-34, you keep your eyes locked on your lead plane while making subtle adjustments with the stick. If Rolex wasn't snowing me about the quality of FIGHT'S ON! Once we reached the exercise area, we flew in a trail formation, taking praclice shots. (For less experienced pilots, this guarantees some kill video.) Each T34 is equipped with a laser and laserdetection devices. Pressing the joystick trigger fires the laser and plays a sampled machine-gun sound. If you hit the other plane, a smoke system triggers and a kill siren plays in the target pilot's headset to let him know he just died. After the practice, the fight was on. We took turns going one-on-one, sticking primarily to the High and Low YoYos we'd been trained in. There's not much of a vertical element in the first phase of Sky Warriors training, so we never got close to the 3,000 foot hard deck. Even with the gentle beginning sortie, combat was exhilarating. Even the best sim experience can't match the adrenaline rush of pulling Gs as you slide in 600 feet behind another aircraft, press the trigger, and see the satisfying trail of smoke that signifies a kill. One big difference from sim flight was the use of the body as a cuc for staying in the plane's performance cnvelope. The difference between 3 Gs and 4 Gs was quite pronounced as my body was pressed back into the seat; and a slight tickle in the stick warned of accelerated stalls when I pulled too hard into a turn. For about $700, you get a militarystyle briefing in combat tactics, approximately 1.25 hours of flight time, and a video of the experience with external, gunsight, and «hero cam» views. It's an expensive experience, but it's one you'll never forget. 141SW THREE VIEWS TO A KILL Each Sky Warriors T-34 is equipped with three cameras: a gun camera, the \"hero cam,\" and a forward-looking fisheye camera.

"CRITIC AT LARGE CHARLES ARDAI Hollywood Hooey Why Games Should Not Try To Be Movies ome 15 years ago, my father sat me on his knee and said, \"Son, I know how you enjoy those video games of yours, but you ain't seen nothing yet. Think Pac-Man is really something? One day video games won't be about a big dot eating little dots; they'll have pictures of actual people moving around and doing things. T'll be like a movie.\" To which I responded, \"No! You can't make a game that way! It wouldn't be any good!\" And life being what it is, a thing of ironics and reversals, it has come to pass that we were both right. in games tends to be a Who's Who of has-beens, never-weres, and nevergonna-bes. Sometimes a game surprises you with good casting, but then, sometimes an airplane crash surprises you by yielding survivors. But, the odds against that happening are enormous. But it's not just the casts' fault. Nor is it the amateurish dialogue, which gamers have trained themselves to ignore, or the wallowing in stereotype and cliché. (God save us from another The problem with FMV games is that as movies, they are second-rate games, and as games, they are second-rate movies. FMV. Gameplay is slower and jerkier, and all for what? So you can see your opponents OTHELLO disks lipped by some ham dressed up as Leonardo DaVinci? The second category includes all the games that exist solely as experiments in FMV. The earliest was VOYEUR, which Phillips is still peddling, all these years later, as a PC CD-ROM. Here, you direct your\"telescope\" to peer into your choice of a few dozen windows in a house across the road. Which video scene plays depends upon which window you choose. The most recent entry into this category is Any Rivers A FORK IN THE TALE, in which you have to click on icons superimposed on video scenes to select which plot branch (that is to say, which video scene) to visit next. Inside a given scene, there is no opportunity to interact or, frankly, to do anything at all. It's like pressing Play on a really crummy VCR that contains a lousy, one-minute-long videotape; then doing it again, and again and again. GEKK DLOOS KATED SAADIATONICS ACT LUCASIAN CUT-SCENE Now standard industry lingo for a non-interactive sequence, the term came from LucasArts which coined it for MANIAC MANSION; but there the cut-scenes were animated, not video. TWO THUMBS DOWN Multimedia games have been with us for several years now. The first one I remember was DAVID WOLF: SECRET AGENT, by Dynamix, which interspersed crude video cut-scenes in the crude action sequences. If you count animated cutscenes, you can stretch the definition to include the animated interludes between mazes in Pac-Man (and my comparison of this game to DAVID WOLF irritates some Dynamix folks even today). Ever since then, the quality of the video has been improving-in terms of frames-persecond and the like-but the games in which full-motion video is used are still, by and large, clismal. For starters, filming video sequences for a game requires that you hire actors, and the best actors generally go where the best money is. Except for a few slumming visionaries who have been willing to participate in a game for the hell of it, the dramatis personae featured FMV game featuring a trench coat, a whiskey bottle, a voiceover, and a saxophone.) The thing that really makes FMV games dismal is that, as games, they are either utterly unimproved or actively worsened by the presence of the FMV sequences. Into the first category fall all the games that would play exactly the same if you removed the FMV. Hasbros new versions of BATTLESHIP and OTHELLO, for instance, or the enhanced version of SimCriy, don't benefit materially from THE SLICK AND THE DAD When I show my father some of the latest games, he never misses a chance to say, \"I told you so.\" And so he did. Games today often contain video sequences, and those sequences are sort of like movies. The problem is that as movies, they are second-rate games, and as games, they are second-rate movies. There is something to be said for the second-rate, of course, particularly in a mediums early years. No one today compliments the camerawork or the writing in the average silent picture, but we recognize that it was a phase the movie industry had to go through. Caming will go through this phase and emerge the better for it. But, oh, how I wish it were over! think even my father would agree that another 15 years is just too long to wait & CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

"TERRY COLEMAN STRATEGY/WARGAMES otrat applie Does Microsoft Know Games? If You Had Doubts, Take a look at Its New Strategy Lineup If anyone can afford to buy a clue in the computer gaming industry, it's Bill Gates. Il or years it was easy to deride Microsoft's misguided forays into the gaming fieldalthough it left you feeling strangely guilty, sort of like making fun of the Polish Air Force in WWII. While MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS and MICROSOFT BASKETBALL showed some improvement, clunkers like DEADLY TIDE made you wonder whether the folks from Redmond had learned any lasting lessons. Of course, Microsoft is as determined as ever to dominate computer entertainment, just as they have productivity software, and they've continued to throw their formidable resources at the problem. One things for sure, if anyone can afford to buy a clue in the computergaming industry, it's Bill Gates. HOSTILE TAKEOVER? Once Windows 95 was established albeit with a lot of pain--as the new frontier in gaming platforms, the next item on the Microsoft agenda was to break into the lucrative strategy genre. However, instead of using internal development to try to compete with big guns like Westwood, Blizzard, SSI, and MicroProse, Microsoft wisely pursued free agents with a vengeance. Atomic Cames, of course, signed first, and CLOSE COMBAT did well enough to sire a sequel. Then Microsoft signed Ensemble Studios, which teamed up with a blast from the past, Bruce Shelley (of RAILROAD Tycoon and SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION fame), to produce ACE OF EMPIRES, due this fall. To complete its three-pronged attack, Microsoft snapped up the rights to distribute SSGS REACH FOR THE STARS II, which updates the spaceploitation classic for modern processors and Windows 95. Of the three games, the one most likely to release first should be CLOSE COMBAT II, which appears to be on target for November. The irony is that despite the relatively short development time, CLOSE COMBAT II will almost certainly be Atomic's best game since OPERATION CRUSADER (Avalon Hill). Where the WORLD AT WAR system, in retrospect, seemed to be stuck in a holding pattern after CRUSADER, CLOSE COMBAT II vastly improves on the shortcomings of its progenitor. The Arnhem campaign is much more vividly portrayed here than in Atomic's previous MARKET-GARDEN (360 Pacific). The graphics are nothing short of superb: detailed road nets; multilayered buildings: new, crisp artwork for soldiers and tanks alike. What's impressive is that the pretty pictures don't compromise the authentic feel of the battle. Everything is so perfectly placed that you hardly question the location of the drop zones or the place ment of the snipers. The psychological models for the individual soldiers are back, but with some twists.

Rod Olsen is crafting an alternative to his BATTLES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC with the working title similar to Tokyo EXPRESS (as far as we know, Avalon Hill still owns the copyright to that one). Andrew Visscher, meanwhile, has nearly completed another epic card game for Windows 95, tentatively titled SOLITAIRE'S EMPIRE-with over 200 solitaire games! CEO Manny Granillo (designer of DRAGON LORE and LEGIONS) plans to hit the strategy market in a big way. The upcoming PLATOON LEADER covers small-unit WWII conflict in a manner similar to SSI's venerable COMPUTER AMBUSH.

It's a little too early to tell if the fuzzy logic used for the Al will become the WWII version of BIGGER Blue or just soggy lint, but at least the design team is trying a different tack. With plenty of famous scenarios (Remagen is pretty tense) and a distinct role-playing feel, this one looks like a real sleeper. Dark Comic Images Coinciding with the release of MicroProse's GUARDIANS: AGENTS OF JUSTICE, Wildstorm STRATEGYI WARGAMES benefit. My only question is this: When does this system get translated to the North African desert? battles. Finally, there is an overarching campaign that allows you to take the role of the paratroopers landing at Amhem or the Allied forces trying to link up with them from the southwest. Throw in a good mix of historically plausible alternative scenarios, and you have one potentially great wargame. It's wonderful that Atomic Games has found its creative second wind. As Atomic and Microsoft contime to push each other, gamers will only RISE AND FALL As you probably noticed from this months sneak preview of AGE OF EMPIRES, this game is not just CIVILIZATION with a real-time twist. There are some similarities, but ACE OF EMPIRES has its own distinctive style. Focusing on the ancient world-and pulling it off — is a stroke of genius, because all of the other games that have tried to simulate this time period, even sure.

My big problem with the first CLOSE COMBAT was that it wasn't much of a game. And even when it's considered a combat simulation, the concept didn't always work. Too often, CLOSE COMBAT ran under its own stcam, as it didn't seem to make any difference what decisions you made-hardly incentive for replay.

I particularly like the fact that you can win economically as well as through combat, so that play doesn't degenerate into another C&C clone. It's certainly more suited for a quick game during lunch than is Civ, and the terrain editor is one of the best I've seen this year. When I first saw ACE OF EMPIRES months ago, I wasn't particularly impressed. But Bruce Shelley and Ensemble Studios kept at it, and they have one of the freshest titles of the year. My main concern is how well the Al will hold up, since most gamers still play the majority of their games solo. If that isn't a problem, and the dynamic differences between the various tribes are fleshed out in the final design, then this will be one of the contenders for best strategy game. Let me put one rumor to rest, however. Bruce Shelley is not the patron saint of turn-based gamers, any more than Sid Meier is.

It includes: details on some weapons not covered in the original manual, intelligence and tips for minecrawlers four and five in particular (since one and two were already covered, and three isn't so hard); detailed methods of killing the drivers of the third, fourth, and fifth minecrawler; and a guide to killing Gunter in the final battle.

Save Bones for alicns in trenches or turrets, or for a cluster of generators, and it will cut down on the enemies you have to face. WEAPONS EVALUATION The Whites of Their Eyes Your basic sniper bullet is quite useful, as it deals decent damage and comes in unlimited quantities. The first upgrade is the homing bullet, which tracks whatever was under the cross hairs when you fired. This is effective for targeting those snipers that stay in one place to aim and then move. Their main disadvantage is their less-than-stellar turning speed, so don't expect them to go around corners every time. The next upgrade is the sniper grenade. Since it explodes, it's useful for times when you can't get a precise shot; the explosion is sure to hit something. It's also good for tightly packed groups. This also comes in a homing version, making it even more lethal. Then comes the mortar, which is harder to use because it bounces and employs a timer. It's hard to hit someone directly with it, since the bouncing makes it a bit unpredictable, and the timer means the blast is delayed. But, if you're on an elevated platform overlooking enemies, it's good to send down a shower of them. Since it doesn't explode right away, you can try to bounce it around corners and use it as a makeshift camera. Finally comes the Bones Airstrike. This is best for saturating immobile groups of enemies or generators Since Bones takes a while to get Up Close and Personal The weapons not covered in depth in the manual are the Thumper and the Twister. The Thumper is a large hammer that causes a small earthquake, which disorients and damages your opponents. But it can damage you as well, so the best advice is to jump around with the parachute once you trigger it. The 'Twister is something totally new, and is a great area-effect weapon. It simply creates a tornado of energy that spins out rays in various directions, which in turn damage all enemies in the general area. The grunts will be killed while the larger ones will be bacily hurt. Save this weapon for crowded areas, and then pick off any stragglers that survive the onslaught. LEVEL TRICKS Snowboards Away!

"STRATEGY & TIPS: MDK GAMER'S EDGE aliens inside a submarine, so when you clear out the sub, the minecrawler ceases to exist. To get into the sub you have to dispatch two annoying «charging snipers\" first. Once you get rid of them, the enemy drops a tank on you. After destroying the tank, you'll gain the World's Smallest Nuclear Explosion, which you use to open the sub's hatch door. Then, you'll see one of the machines you have to destroy: a submarine turret. The alien inside is completely encased in armor, so a shot to his head won't work. The only opening is at the bottom of the turret, and the turret floats on top of an airlift. All you have to do is deliver\" some explosives to him. Avoid the explosive balls he chucks at you, and toss BIG APPETITE Toss the \"Gunter Snack\" to distract Gunter and grab that nuke behind him. grenades into that airlift. They will go into the one hole that is open and injure him. It takes about three or four grenades to kill him. Proceed to the top of the submarine and destroy all the grunts and generators waiting for you. This is where a decoy comes in handy. Finally, follow the snowboarding sequence to the second turret, destroy him as you destroyed the first, and the submarine and minecrawler will be destroyed. UPSY-DAISY Toss the grenade into the airlift in order to injure the turret gunners for the fourth minecrawler. Snipe That Dreadnought You'll see Boncs strung up and Gunter relaxing, but this isn't where you face him yet. When you get his attention by taking a potshot at him, he closes his chamber and that dreadnought that has been hounding you since the beginning of the level arrives. Just as you will have done earlier in the level, disable the ship by simply shooting off its turrets. The dreadnought will fly by at a distance, which is the perfect time to snipe away, since its shots take a while to reach you. When it passes directly over you, it's time to run and dodge. The dreadnought repeats this pattern of \"fire from afar\" and \"close pass» so just persevere and you will shoot it down, thus destroying the fifth and final minecrawler. Feed Me! Your final, mano a mano fight with Gunter isn't a fistfight, it's a game of distraction and dodging. To free Boncs, you need to unlock his ropes by using World's Smallest Nuclear Explosions. Yet the muke is behind Gunter, who is simply too big and powerful for a frontal assault. Instead, jump on the button to conjure a «gunter snack,\" pick it up and use it near Gunter. He will run to eat it, giving you a chance to slip by, pick up the nuke, and run to a working airlift to unlock a rope. Just repeat this process until Bones is free. Aside from Gunters one guard alicn, the only real worry you have is taking too long (Gunter will attack eventually). Avoid the both of them, free Bones, and then use Bones to finally kill Center once and for all. Then, peace will finally be restored. MAN THE CANNONS Shoot these turrets off the dreadnought to get it off your back in the beginning and end of minecrawler five. CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS a History of the World Door How To Mold History in Your Own Image by Terry Coleman ure, HISTORY OF THE WORLD doesn't quite measure up to the inspired multiplayer dynamics of the boardgame on which it is based -mostly because there are no provisions for LAN or Internet play. Still, it offers strong Al opponents and much faster play. Plus, the computer relieves you of those nagging accounting headaches. With that in mind, here are my 'Top 10 tips and advice on which empires to playand which empires to avoid at all costs. The Victor Writes the History 1. Every game should have six players, even if you have to fill out the ranks with Al empire-builders. Playing with fewer will guarantee a faster finish, but since the computer version plays three to four times faster than cardboard anyway, what's the point? 2. Should you play with seven players? No. Just because something is different on the computer (the boardgame allows for only six players), doesn't make it better. You lose the element of mystery that occurs in those games when no one gets the Mongols—or gets stuck with the Khmers. 3. Use my favorite game bug. One bug in the programming occasionally lets you use the same disaster card twice on an opponent. What a nice problem to have. 4. Stay away from the fortress option. This is important if you want a freewheeling game. Those who desire more defensive-minded games should try Risk! 5. Don't use the silly Preservation of Culture rule. What little historical flavor there is, is thereby lost. Worse, this channels play into toopredictable lines. Besides, you should never become too attached to a monument (sce Number 3). 6. Don't fret over lost territory! The game is designed so that empires rise and fall appropriately. You can actually come from behind to win games -even if you end one of the middle turns with zero pieces in play--because no one considers you a threat! 7. It's bad to be the front-runner early on. It's often better to pass on the Romans or Persians, so that you get better card picks later. 8. Don't let anyone have a back-to-back turn. For example, sticking someone with Russia the last turn is usually a good bet-unless they just wrapped up the previous turn with Spain or the Mughals. If so, that player would rack up all the points from last turn plus the new turn. I once saw a toumament decided this way after five hours of tense play. Event Event Epoch VI play before turn BLACK DEATH Two adjacent Areas of your choice must roll one die for each army therein. Each roll of \"1\" 1347 AD eliminates an army from the Land which rolled that «1.\" Epochs I-VII play during turn TREACHERY This card may be used once to automatically win all attacks in one Land during the current turn. Already lost battles cannot be voided by a declaration of Treachery. The card's use must be declared before any battles it will win are rolled. CGW OCTOBER 1997 "

Startland Monta 20 Start Lady 9. The game is usually won or lost by how you manage middle empires. This is so true, although it's always tempting to save killer cards for the big empires. The Portuguese are tough with Naval Supremacy and/or Ship Building, and even the Chola benefit from a Treachery or Population Explosion card. 10. Don't underestimate the joys of email play. History is the perfect game to play a tum before breakfast, or between projects while at work. Be sure that you remember to send diplomatic messages to other players when you send off your saved-game email file to the next opponent. The computer version of History can't match the boardgame for player interaction, but with an honest effort at back-stabbing, deal-making, and abject whining, it can still be a fun experience. that can really make hay in the penultimate epoch. Choose your beachheads in the Americas well and you might keep them out of Britain's hands. Stick to the oceans 15 rather than the seas. Tips: Save a Barbarian card to clear out territory that you can then walk into freely. Fanaticism is appropriate; missionaries historically accompanied Conquistadors. Lasi. The Top 10 Empires 3.

EWMA North Se . Bra Lader LAN OTTOMAN TURKS 6. Ottoman Turks Power: 15 The Scoop: Sort of the poor man's Arabs, this empire benefits from a power vacuum. Go for broke, especially in the Middle East and India. Between Portugal, Spain, 15 and the Mughals, it's likely your empire won't last out the turn. Tips: A better time for Naval Technology than a Leader card. Use Pestilence; Plague; and, especially, Black Death (only good during this epoch) to soften up your enemies. 1. Britain Power: 20 The Scoop: This is the one Empire card you never trade away. If you are within 40 of the leader on the last turn and you get Britain, you have a good shot at winning. Having access to every ocean means that 20 you can strike anywhere in the world. Tips: Keep a Civil Service or Population Explosion card for a couple of extra armies. Don't worry about defense; once you've scored your points, no one can take them away from you. Stact Land: Western Anatolia 4. Arabs Power: 18 The Scoop: By the time the Arabs show up, the Middle East is usually devastated and open for dominance, as is Africa. Shoot for a presence in Europe and India as well, and place fleets carefully (the Red Sea), so that Start Land: Arabian Palma they will last extra turns. Tips: Be cliché: Revel in a Jihad celebration if you have the card. Otherwise, this versatile empire benefits from almost any event you play. 5. Spain Power: 15 The Scoop: An oft-underrated empire 7.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: SHADOWS OVER RIVA GAMER'S EDGE will be outnumbered by the enemy, and delaying tactics are vital to surviving. Casting Lightning and Somnigravis in the first couple of rounds is important. Elves are especially good with Somnigravis and can (with high skill) keep opponents snoozing through much of the fight. The only difficully is remembering which ones have been put to sleep; attacking a sleeping opponent will wake it up again. Obviously, this is something to be avoided! Try to keep your fighters from becoming surrounded. If that happens, knock out one or two enemies with spells as soon as possible. Try to position your spellcasters and elves in the rear, but where they have good diagonal lines for casting spells and using bows (the diagonal doesn't have to be exact, but there must be a clear path to the target). Mages in particular should have their full eight movement points available during combat. If things are going badly, don't wait for the inevitable. Restore to a previous save and try again, or avoid the combat (if possible) until your party is better equipped or has advanced in level. Early on, you have the chance to add Thorgrimm to your party as an NPC companion. He is an excellent fighter and can be helpful in many tough combats. The downside is that he shares in the experience awards, thereby giving less to your own people. If you have Thorgrimm with you whenever possible it will cost you a level gain for your characters. This is something to think about, as you'll only get about a maximum of three levels by the time you're into the endgame. walls along the way for magic runes your magician can translate.

For instance, if you try to use the handbrake as your main brake, you'll trash your car. Instead, use the handbrake for tackling tough corners. If you hold the handbrake, the wheelspin, a direction key, and accelerate buttons together, then release the handbrake, you can spin 1:35 1 your car around in a circle on the spot1000 CREDITS rather handy in car-to-car duels.

"TIPS! Strategy/Wargames DUNGEON KEEPER There are many mysteries in Bullfrog's DUNGEON KEEPER, but few as darkly shrouded as the Temple sacrifice. The fetid waters of the Temple pools accept all offerings, but the gods are a fickle lot, and only certain creatures—and combinations of creatures --will please them.

Your creatures become diseased THE ARDENNES OFFENSIVE W hen the computer calculates the combat algorithms, the WW two most important factors are tactical advantage and divisional integrity. Since any defending unit gets an automatic four-column odds shift, the only way to overcome this advantage is to attack from several hexes. Keep in mind that divisional integrity bonuses vary with each division and PETERSEN are further modified by m . G AND GREGORIO the number of adjacent NED FEFD units actually attacking. A U DEBERS crack SS division, or the IS! U.S. Anny famous U.S. Big Red One, packs a lot more punch than an ad hoc 1944 Wehrmacht formation. When you attack, remember that the initial odds shown represent only one attacking unit. To call in all available support, just hit the MAX button on the tactical display. If you are in an obvious overkill situation, don't waste firepower: \"Turn off\" units you don't need in this particular attack until you reach optimal odds Imp.

Because its realistic flight modeling can keep some pilots who trained on older sims stuck on the ground, we're including the following primer. Takeoff: WARBIRDS planes properly model engine torque, and many pilots find themselves careening into the control tower when they try to take off. First, apply engine power slowly. Then, if you find your plane pulling to the left, simply apply right rudder using the keyboard, rudder pedals, or, if you have a Sidewinder joystick, by twisting the stick to the right. If you don't have pedals, you can cheat a bit and use the automatic trim system to straighten the planes flight path — just hit X to engage the automatic trim system and then pull back on the stick to disengage it Cruise: In the air, you'll also find your plane doesn't always want to follow a x Set straight-and-level cruise Ctrl-X Angle trim; keeps the plane at the current climb or dive angle Alt-x Speed trim; causes the plane to climb or dive to maintain current speed Just as in a real plane, trim is affected by speed. So if you set the trim for straightand-level cruise at 250 knots and then you firewall the throttle, your plane will pick up speed and start to climb. Simply hit X twice to disengage and reengage the trim for the new speed. GLASS OCTOBER 1997 CGW "

Why would any. for your interplanetary starship and hiring a cusone want to play a game about urban tom crew to explore that universe. Such was the setup for planning? Even SimCity designer Will Wright didn't realize STARFLIGHT, one of the largest and most open-ended role playing games ever. Each what he'd done when he combined the terrain editor from his classic RAID ON planetary landscape was interesting, since the program used fractals to generate BUNGELING BAY with his interest in building cities. SimCity started out as a playground unique maps and you had to decide where to mine for the elusive Endurium that for his imagination and became the most successful \"software toy\" ever published. fueled your ship and paid your way. Wright was inspired by a short story from Stanislaw Lem's The Cyberiad called \"The Your goal in STARFLIGHT was to explore the 270 star systems and find a replace Seventh Sally,\" conversations with his MIT urban planning graduate neighbor, and ment for the planet Arth, your home planet. You needed to find this replacement in many days of creating cityscapes with his old terrain editor. He ended up creating a order to evacuate the residents of Arth prior to an imminent disaster. Along the way game in which you built cities for the benefit of simulated citizens (the underlying you ran into the most alien group of aliens ever seen in a computer game.

He decided to put in with the most complete knowledge of the galactic situation; and a host of others.

"PATCHES omputer game programs have grown so massive, and the number of hardware configurations has become so huge, that incompatibilities and glitches are frustratingly common. Software fixes, or \"patches,\" for buggy programs have become a necessary evil until we reach the golden age of standardized platforms and bug-free programs. New patches are in red. 1 Dawn Patrol V1.7: New wings for Empire's veteran WWI flight sim. 3D-Ultra Pinball 2-Creep Night V1.1 for Mac: This version corrects the \"black quit screen\" problem, as well as some sound hiccups. SVGA-graphics carnage with these patches for 3Dfx and Rendition: based cards! Diablo V1.04: This amulet of patch protection prevents invalid packets from crashing multiplayer games, fixes the Hidden Shrine freeze-up, and prevents the Black Death crash. Outlaws V1.1: 3DIX support makes this faster on the draw than Jesse James.  Check for new patches on the demo disc. A-10 Cuba! V1.2: Faster frame rates, better messaging, and better joystick controls are but a few of the improvements to keep you in the air longer. Beware: This works only if you have the previous 1.01 patch installed! Dragons in the Mist V1.01: Patch in the Pacific, WWII. Settlers 2 V1,51: Midi and mouse problems are cleaned up, but this patch makes your current saved games unplayable. Finish any cur. rent maps, then start on the next map after installing the update. Net AH-64D Longbow Gold V1.04: Fixes movie player and garbled speech problem for the gold version of this Jane's combat sim only. Flying Corps V1.00a: Additional hotkeys for camera and cockpit views add even more visceral excitement to Empire's acclaimed WWI flight sim. US Navy Fighters '97 V1.3: You'll fly faster with fewer 3D complaints. This also enables dogfights over TCP/IP. Harpoon Classic '97 V1.63d: The latest Win 95 executable to make your favorite fleet more seaworthy. Archimedean Dynasty V1.120: View clips from the game with the new movie player, and use the Transparency effect from the Vectorgraphic menu to see through explosions and other environmental effects. Added Z-buffering allows for more accurate targeting as well. Patches can usually be downloaded from online networks (such as CompuServe and ZDNet), from CGW's Web site (www. computergaming.com), or from the individual soft ware publisher's Web site (see listing below). X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter V1.10: Your fighters now handle better than a wet womprat in an ice storm o n Hoth during multiplayer games, Interstate '76 V1.06: More than a dozen fixes make this the hippest baddest multi-melee aroundespecially since the host no longer gets double kills, and \"partial deaths\" are no more. ATF Sounds: Better explosions through optional digital sounds for NATO FIGHTERS or ATF GOLD. Jack Nicklaus 4: Slice, hook, and putt much faster over the Net, even when using machines with only the minimum system requirements. Broken Alliance V1.02: Latest upgrade for HPS Simulations' add on to PANTHERS IN THE SHADOWS. Civilization II Scenarios V1.1: Mostly tweaking to balance scenarios and to stiffen the challenge of this commendable add-on pack. Magic The Gathering V1.1: Better AI, sound, and animation are but a few of the fixes in MicroProse's version of the Wizards of the Coast classic Command & Conquer for Mac V1.71: Note: If you fail to trash your old C&C version (and empty the trash can), when you play an Internet game, Mac WCHAT will detect the old version (even if it's in the trash can) and prompt you for an update (even though you've already updated). MechWarrior Mercenaries V1.06: Regardless of clan affiliation, all will benefit from this latest upgrade, which repairs more mech deficiencies.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what thwor, ME What's the Deal BV with...Ethics? you would realize the simple truth: We Gods amongst gamers make so little in the way of royalties from the sale of these strategy books that only a moron would believe we'd risk our credibility by purposely giving a bad game a good review just to sell a few more books.\" early a year ago I started a minor news group brushfire when I made a fairly oblique reference to a dubious moment in game. reviewing history. This minor debate eventually came to a head with a thought-provoking letter, published in this magazine. In it, the reviewer made reference to-Mr. Trotter--very graciously explained the bad situation he had found himself in, and the resulting state of mind that led him to overrate a game that he was reviewing (for a competing magazine), after having written a strategy book for the selfsame game. Mr. Trotter's eloquent explanation certainly dispelled my lingering resentment over the incident, and almost made me feel bad about bringing it up at all. I say \"almost\" because I think anything that leads to healthy debate in the industry is a good thing, regardless of how awk. ward it can be Unfortunately, one aspect of the online squabble lingers on. We still haven't settled the issue of ethical behavior on the part of a game reviewer, and to be honest, some of the stuff I'm hearing out there is starting to bug me again. Recently, some professionals have begun to express an almost imperial arrogance toward the consumer. It goes something like this: \"If only you poor slobs had the slightest inkling of the true machinations of publishing, olishing, ( Readers must be able to believe not only in the magazine they read, but also in the individual writers who write I for it. your next advance if your last guide was for Quake instead of THIS MEANS WAR. Anyone who does a strat guide wants it to be for a Top 10 game. But be that as it may, the technical reality of how much a reviewer stands to gain financially is actually irrele. vant, compared to how such situations appear to the average reader. To mangle a phrase from this decade's favorite fantasy hero, \"Impropriety is as Impropriety does.\" Who cares what we \"in the know\" really know? What matters is what readers think when they see the same name on a review that they saw on a $20 strat guide. Do they sagely nod and say, \"The realities of professional publishing make it unlikely that we're the victims of a scam\"? Somehow I suspect the more likely scenario is that the magazine that publishes that review loses another customer forever. Even in cases where the game, the review, and the strat guide are all of high quality, it does the business little good if a writer is responsible for a big money guide book and then pens the review of that same game. If we lived in a world where reviews were written first, and strat books second, it might be different-but we can all remember seeing guides that have beaten the game to the shelves. I just doesn't look good, and it's a practice that should stop, if for no other reason than the fact that the amount of money to be made from the review is paltry compared to the money made from the strat guide. Why give even the appearance of impropriety for a paltry few hundred dollars when the book has already earned you a few Gs of cool, hard cash? Let somebody else do the review, so that people have one less reason to believe that all gaming journalists are on the take.\" All computer game magazines exist on the fine edge of reader trust (Okay, reader trust and the desire to see cool screenshots of games that are going to be vaporware for at least another two years.) Readers must be able to believe not only in the magazine they read, but also in the individu al writers who write for it, or logically, they're wasting their money. While ! am thrilled that some of you out there will stick with the Fourth Estate through thick and thin, I'm not going to be the one explaining, \"Gee-sure wrote a great review of that game, but it had nothing to do with the company flying me down to see their late beta for an all-expenses-paid week...\" You folks out there don't have months of design notes, long person: al talks with the designers, or pleasant tours through spiffy offices to help you get the most out of a game...and neither should we. If we are in a position to know so much about a game then we obviously are a little too close for an impartial judg. ment. We should leave that particular review to someone else. Period. Absolute impartiality, both in reality and appearance, should be the only real ethic in this business...everything else is just sophistry and smoke. Now to a certain extent, this point is valid. If you readers could look over the average strat book contract, you would indeed see that no one is going to get rich from royalties earned in this business. On the other hand, don't let anyone fool you into thinking that there's no difference in thinking that there's no difference in Computer Gaming World (ISSN 0744-6667) is published monthly by Zift-Davis, Inc.
