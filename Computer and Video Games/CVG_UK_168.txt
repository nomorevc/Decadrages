"EDITORIAL RIAL corona CHG people bits Hey kids! Wouldn't you just love to know what's in store for your favourite magazine journalists over the next four weeks? Well you'd better put CVG down and pick up Axe Child Periodical or whatever your favourite magazine really is. We'll just make do with some more of our star (ha ha) astronomer's wonderful predictions he front paul I predict that you'll have a very tense back within the next four weeks. The fact that you've just taken over as Editor of the brightest, breeziest, busiest, most stress-filled and hard work video games magazine may have something to do with this. Or perhaps it's your rigid adherence to the Northern custom of sleeping in a coalmine. Lucky Day: Never OUR MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE gary This month thieves will break into your car and steal an awful lot of stuff. Although that's not exactly much of a prediction, because it happens about every fortnight on average anyway. Fairly soon you're going to run out stuff to leave in your car waiting to be stolen. Try bulky items of furniture as opposed to tiny credit cards and wads of bills. Lucky Hamster: Hammy rad This month you'll be contacted by an alien race, seeking to benefit from your knowledge. They will ask you directions to the Ikea Superstore, requiring certain DIY materials to repair their space ship. Sadly ou have a crap sense of direction and instead direct them to a top secret military installation, where they are captured and the technology aboard their craft used in new Doomsday weapons which destroy the world. Lucky Bite: Toucan The computer industry adage states that as processor power doubles, the production costs halve. This is all very well if you're Johnny Mainframe developing huge computers for research institutes and so on, but it has stuff all practical effect for consumers. The last 10 years have seen the computer games industry develop from 8-bit four-colour home computers with tape-based loading systems like the Spectrum to a cartridge-based, console-dominated arena, and soon into a 32and 64-bit CD-ROM scene. The cost of both machines and games has steadily increased disproportionately to inflation. When we at CVG were nippers 10 quid was as much as you'd pay for even a top game. Nowadays softcos are charging up to  for a cart. You're not just paying for a game anymore, you're paying for the branding, the packaging, the advertising budget and the PR firms which sell the games to retailers and magazines. Yes, development costs have risen exponentially as gamers demand more sophisticated titles, but the fact remains that playing games is now a very serious business. And like any business those within it are out to make as much dough as possible. And given that this is your dough, quite some quantity of it, and you're looking at a pretty long-term home entertainment investment you'd be pretty stupid not to find out as much information as possible before opening your wallet for either machine or game. While CVG has endeavoured to deliver this alongside unbiased opinion 14 blinkin' years, longer than anyone else in the biz, we feel that the changes in the gaming world need to be reflected by our magazine. In short, it's time for something new. We'll be sticking to the same editorial policy except more so. We want to deliver still more info, a bigger overview of the whole industry and be more ruthless with our comments and ratings so you can make your decisions better prepared. You'll be able to buy the finished article next month. Trust us it'll be better than sex.* The Collective Mind of CVG. *Well, sex with Paul anyway. julie It's your birthday this month, and you'll receive lots of presents from people in the office. Among these will be anti-depressants, fluffy, cuddly toy animals, cheery slogan stickers for your computer, balloons, the joyous laughs of children and other worryingly uplifting gifts. Do not open them, or your permanent cloud of gloom could be dispersed. Lucky Bird Call: Parakeet trea I predict that you'll go on holiday again this month. Alright, so that's and her easy prediction to make given your 'carefree' (ie slack) antipodean outlook. Why bother going to work when there's another barby in Africa to attend? Why slave over a hot Macintosh for some pasty poms when there are glorious beaches still not lazed around upon? It's alright for some. Luckily for everyone you contract 18 forms of malaria and spend your hols in a badly equipped kangaroo hospital. Lucky Leaf: Maple "

"NEWS CVG NEWS connected MASTER BLASTER KILL YOUR HEAD Sony flexed their wallet and opened the Live '95 consumer show with a massive exploding head stunt, mimicking their current ad campaign for the PlayStation. The actual cost of the stunt is unknown, although the company had to secure ,000,000 worth of insurance (for the surrounding area) before the prank could go ahead. Blimey. Creative Labs have announced plans for their latest crack at the big money. After pretty much standardising sound cards with the SoundBlaster, Creative are challenging 32-bit consoles with their new 3D Blaster a graphics card which supposedly offers superlative polygon handling for any PC. CVG were vited to an unveiling ceremony where Creative Labs outlined their business plan, which includes the introduction of a standard graphics, sound and telecommunications card by 1998, and were subjected to a lengthy demonstration of the capabilities of the new 3D card. To be honest, the early demo on display, whilst decent by low-grade PC standards, was a long way from bettering the current PlayStation or even Saturn polygon software. We'll keep you posted on any further developments. IT'S LIKE ALONE FOR THUNDER PLAYSTATION CAND LIGHTNING) Infogrammes distinguished themselves with a spectacular conversion of their PC hit Alone in the Dark for the PlayStation. It features a whole ruck of previously unseen Silicon Graphics routines which look lovely. Look out for a review soon-ish. Next Gen consoles means the Alone in the Dark series is destined for PlayStation. The game that set the Mega-CD alight (whereas now most MCD owners are just setting their machines alight) was without a doubt Thunderhawk from Core Design. Now the Saturn's here and the quality software far outweighs the crap stuff, and so to set the Saturn alight Firestorm: Thunderhawk 2 needs to be something really spesh. And worry ye not because it looks sensational, and we've tested out the first couple of levels, and they play like a dream. The 3D perspective looks incredible as your targeting cursor actually moves realistically round the cockpit; and the polygonised 'copter turns, flys, rotates and shoots so well that you can't quite believe what you ever saw in Jungle Strike et al. The Saturn version is aiming for a November release as are the PC and PlayStation versions. Yip. Eee.

"NEWS CVG NEWS conhec OK, the Jag might not be a cool new console but Atari does have some up-and-coming titles on the way... KATARI PRIMAL RAGE CD ATTACK OF ATTACK OF THE MUTANT PENGUINS The third party game which aroused the most interest was Time Warner's conversion of Primal Rage for the Jag CD, definitely the best version of the game we've seen so far. The sprites are arcade-size and move in a convincingly unconvincing coin-op fashion. The sound's great too, and there's generally not much chance of disappointing coinop fans when it's finally released. HIGHLANDER CD One of the European developments on display, and probably the most visible game Atari will push before Christmas, is the British title Attack of the Mutant Penguins. We'll explain the plot in the future, because it's a bit complicated, but the game casts you as a friendly alien out to save the world from evil alien penguins with the help of good non-alien penguins. You can tell them apart because the evil penguins are dressed up in clothes. It's a kind of reverse isometric Lemmings as you lead the evil 'guins into traps and destroy them with various weapons whilst saving as many nice birds as possible. It looks quite pretty, although unspectacular, but play-wise this could be a real stormer. We've mentioned this one before, and although there wasn't a lot to see at the recent show, we still reckon that this is going to be one of the more impressive CD titles. Highlander mixes FMV animation (which doesn't really look like FMV, thankfully) with traditional Alone in the Dark-style multi-perspective graphics in an action-RPG setting. We'll bring you more information when we've played a proper playable version. The first RPGstyle game to arrive on the Jag looks likely to be the rather promising Highlander. SUPERCROSS 3D You might be forgiven for thinking that Motocross is still as popular as it was in the early Eighties when it was on Grandstand, with the strange proliferation of games like Dirt Trax FX, Sega's Motocross Championship and now Supercross 3D for the Jaguar. Sadly for kids who like broken legs, it isn't. But that hasn't stopped Atari from pulling out all the stops for this firstor third-person perspective stunts-and-scrapes racer. The frame rate still needs a little work to make the game run smoothly, and the controls are a little awkward as yet, but there's plenty of promise in the title. 14 "


"NEWS NEWS CVG CREDITS sas ZERO FIVE Easily the most impressive game on the Atari stand, and the one which bodes best for the future, was Zero Five. The level on display is best described as a 3D Galaxians, with waves of aliens storming at your space ship in formation. Zero Five distinguishes itself by dint of its ultra-convincing 3D movement and chunky Stunt Race FX-style polygon graphics. Best of all, however, has to be the floating camera, on-a-string viewpoint which allows you to see the action from just about any angle, depending on your movements. It's even possible to have your craft flying out of the screen, seemingly towards your face, as the enemies pile in from behind your head. Well, not really, but that's what it looks like, if you see what we mean. Anyone who really does see aliens flying into their TV from behind their head needs to lay off the cough medicine for a bit. CREDITS 42987 12@G! DEFENDER 2000 We may have written about this one before, but it's just worth mentioning that Defender 2000 has come quite a way since we last saw it. The graphics are pretty much finished (and they look cool, apart from the main ship which looks daft) and the gameplay is all but done. And it's very very hard indeed. Even crusty games expert Paul was stumped to score more than about half a point. Expect this to be the Tempest of next year. Although it'll be released at the end of this year.

"NEWS CVG NEWS connected SEGA. THE CALM COOL COLLECTIVE SEGA GLOBAL GAMING From Sega's point of view, there is no supremacy battle between them and Sony this Christmas. Saturn already won... CVG isn't attempting to sway opinion one way or the other with this feature, but we reckon there's still a number of people who don't yet realise the potential of Sega's plans. Unlike most companies where the line is pretty much drawn with console hardware itself, Sega have the unique benefit of ranking among the world's biggest pioneers of coin-op technology. Their development teams have become superstars of gaming, through providing customers with ground-breaking state-of-the-art experiences time and again. Sega Europe are not at all phased by Sony's  million marketing campaign. They don't need to be. Here's why. What's New ASS Next year Sega launches the Internet JHOANNAJI Reaction System for Saturn. Yes, as of 1996, the 32-bit console goes online with a package designed to introduce gamers to a whole new SOME RATE! experience. Currently the Internet is Company Dom something of an exclusive club for people with money to invest in a PC, New along with the patience to get everything installed. The Reaction System is a module which slots into the Saturn, and immediately puts gamers in touch with a service that is hoped to include product information and shopping opportunities. Eventually Sega intend to support IRS with a keyboard. Very soon you could be picking up a joypad to challenge somebody in Japan to a best two-out-of-three on Virtua Fighter 2, or even racing head to head on Sega Rally! Beyond that it's anybody's guess what Sega have planned for IRS the concept already surpasses all expectations. PERSONALITY Early October saw the launch of the Virtua Fighter anime series in Japan. The show airs on television to millions of Tokyo homes every week, and follows the exploits of Akira as he undertakes a soul-searching journey for his true self. At least three new characters are introduced to the Virtua universe through this series currently Ryu Kaorun, Yan Waymin, and Eva; all of whom trained with Akira in his days as a student. The story follows that Akira's grandfather, Subaru, draws the hero's attention to a mysterious constellation comprising of eight stars. Within them lies Akira's destiny. As he sets out to discover exactly what this is, Akira teams up with Pai Chan, and eventually Jacky and Sarah Bryant who arrive just in time to get them out of a sticky situation. It's not certain which roles the other fighters play yet. For fans of the coin-op, it's exciting to know that the voice of Akira in the anime series is played by Shinichiro Miki — the same actor who provided the speech for the coin-op. Additionally Lau Chan is brought to life with the talent of Shigeru Chiba, who's vocals are instantly recognisable to most young Japanese. One other small but significant feature of VF Anime is the fact that we get to see kage Maru's face. Some people get excited about anything! Though we may never get the chance to see this program on British television, Virtua Fighter: The Anime Series does establish one thing that the game is already legendary. Tekken who? Just kidding... Sony are literally making a big song and dance about their PlayStation room in the Ministry of Sound, at the moment. It's a cool concept, but Sega's highprofile R&D team AM2 recently achieved something many times more impressive. For the launch of their new combat game Fighting Vipers (see JAMMA report,) AM2 targeted a place called Ropongi THE entertainment centre of Tokyo. Here is where all the major night clubs are found, in particular \"Bar, Isn't it?,\" which is where AM2 held this event called 'Gamer's Night.' The evening kicked off at 12:00 am. As techno churned the air AM2 demonstrated Fighting Vipers, which proved itself perfectly suited to the club atmosphere. AM2's flashy techniques combined with the game's bright appeal sent everybody in attendance crazy! Or maybe it was just the orange juice. 16 "


"VISION KONAMI INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR SOCCER RIGHTS RESERVED.  With so much talk of multi-media machines at the moment, probably the least expected contribution is from Sega. Yet their Video CD Card for Saturn goes on sale in October giving owners access to the vast library of Philips Video CD films. It's pricey at .99, but is a cool option for those who can afford it. Proof as much as you'll ever need that Saturn really delivers is laid out for you here, as CVG takes the lid off Sega's box of delights for 1995 and beyond.

"NEWS CVG NEWS connected WING ARMS GUARDIAN HEROES Treasure are back again with yet another genius work, boasting two incredible modes of play. The basic game is a twoplayer hack 'em up, in which it's possible to leap in and out of the screen to do battle across three planes of action. Anyone familiar with Fatal Fury Special should be able to get their head around this concept. Those who aren't... well, tough it's hard to describe. What's easier to understand is that GH is basically a scrolling beat 'em up, in which both players practice Street Fighter II style techniques against hordes of fantastic enemies. The other mode of play allows six players to face off against each other, in a brawl the scale of which could only have been attempted by Treasure! In both instances, the entire screen scales in and out from the action to accommodate the movement of all concerned. Plus the quality of art and animation is phenomenal! Sits you in the cockpit of a World War II fighter plane, of which there is a choice of eight. Three viewpoints are available for missions taking place over desert, sea, and night-time city. It's quite different to the Wing War coin-op, not least in looks due to the extensive texture mapping. Sega have also geared the gameplay so it's more suited to home use, with Mission Objectives to meet. 50 ES SEGA RALLY VIRTUA COP Conversion of AM3's arcade stunner is being ably handled by the same team who squeezed Virtua Racing into the Mega Drive and 32X. More than ever their talents are being brought to the fore as Rally takes form. CVG were visiting Sega Europe the day a 75% version arrived; complete with all the cars, all the circuits, the helicopter, doves on the track everything! Also, and you read it here first, a TWOPLAYER OPTION; almost certain to make use of the link-up extension (nobody could get it working!) Fired-up solo players also have a Time Attack mode to contend with. Is awesome! Another faithful coin-op conversion from AM2. What more can we say, apart from the Saturn version includes Virtua Cops Rayge and Smarty going through pretty much exactly the same motions as they did on Sega's arcade Model 2 board. We know that AM2 are developing VC2 for the arcade at the same time, and are learning new ways to port over the original as they progress. Apparently this means Saturn VC is to gain unique features! w 100 X 1 349SU SEGA (Above) By the size of that cross-hair, you're unlikely to miss really! (Right) A blue flash shows he's been shot by player one. COPE STA un entre Castrol GOLDEN AXE HANG ON '95 Direct from Sega of Japan's arcade division is an exact translation of Golden Axe: Duel. This is possible because Saturn hardware is identical to Titan's ST-V board minus extra memory, and an upgraded sound chip (the Saturn's CD-Rom drive makes up for this.) Obviously it's a two-player combat game which revitalises the Golden Axe theme. Seems okay too. 00000000 Like F1 it seems TIME we're not expected to be impressed with Hang On '95 the same way as we are Daytona USA, or Sega rally. But CVG can't help it we're impressed. And greatly so! The only problem we find so far with the early version is that the control is pretty severe. Otherwise the visuals are okay. In fact the overall presentation of the game is perfectly fine too. Bear in mind Hang On is part of Sega Japan's historical catalogue; along with Shinobi, and Golden Axe. We doubt they would allow the reputation of Hang On '95 to drift out of control. It's expected that at least seven circuits will appear in the final version, plus time attacks, and a fullon Grand Prix mode. 18 "


"KONAMI HOT MEGA DRIVE 32X PREPARE FOR THE STORM Seems people are too keen to forget their Mega Drive. Fools! There's still a few cool reasons to stand by your 16-bit. Light Crusader, and Comix Zone both of which you know about plus the following. 32X KOLIBRI Innovative and beautiful with it. Kolibri is as refreshing as Ecco in that it intends to make players feel like they are a humming bird. At least that's the spiel Sega are handing out! True enough, Kolibri looks very realistic and the gameplay is refreshing for a shoot 'em up. The enemies, all taken from nature, are detailed and to scale. There's even some vaguely interesting puzzles to solve. Best of all players have complete freedom to explore the graphically stunning levels meaning they don't just whiz by and get forgotten. A storm is coming to the «PlayStation»... a GOAL STORM!... as Konami makes its first foray into the 32bit sports arena. From beautifully sculptured polygon characters animated by the latest motion capture technology through to ear bursting commentary and sound effects the attention to detail is obvious. We've included all the features you'd expect from a top notch soccer title including fully selectable team formations, programmable tactics, viewpoints, leagues and every real soccer skill imaginable. MEGA DRIVE PREMIER MANAGER Gremlin have skilfully compressed their hit PC title for a new audience. There's no doubting this sim's quality: 1500 players, each a bonafide individual, await to be managed' as best as possible. The challenge is in finding success among the necessary transfers, and big time promotions. Anyone who fancies the challenge of rising from the position of 4th Division Chairman to Premier League Manager can't go wrong. This is a proven classic. 32X X-MEN Looks cool, don't you think. Well it does considering this is the 32X not 3DO, PlayStation, or even Saturn. XMen is programmed by Scavenger, the same people who brought you Subterrania and Red Zone. As you can see, this is way different to any of those. So far the only version we've seen is a non-interactive demo, but a 3D beat 'em up starring Wolverine and the rest is a promising concept.

ONE PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED PC VERSION AVAILABLE. -The Games Workshop saga comes to life on 3D0, it's your job to find the alien scum on the Space Hulk and let them have it OL WHO'S NICKED ME 501S? ...probably one of the evil mothers who are out for your blood in Space Hulk who go by the name of Genestealers. Not too hot in the looks department, unless you're into lizardy-reptilian looks because that's what they resemble when they come hurtling at you. They have six limbs, two hooved feet, a pair of quasi-human arms and a pair of much larger more muscled arms, which are invariably used to rip you to shreds. Also watch out for Hybrids who while not quite as gruesome or ferocious, are nonetheless quite bulbous and far more cunning. he one thing that Space Hulk is not short on is plot, no doubt because it's the licence from those adventure boardgames-heads Games Workshop; that place in your local shopping mall where all the trainspotters go when BR are having a one-day strike. If the term 'game' tied with 'adventure' makes you think of dulldom on a particularly dull day, don't despair because ultimately this is an arcade shooter that even makes Doom look tame. Essentially Space Hulk is a Doom clone and then some. The Hulk in question is a space ship that is hurtling out of control towards Imperial Planet Devlar III. And it's bad news for the Devlars since it's packed to the rafters with deadly Genestealers (monster thangs), and it's up to you as one of a team of Space Marine Terminators to stop them on their infestation mission. As a marine you are encased in armour, though if you encounter any Marines not in armour then chances are that they are under the evil auspices of Chaos and are traitors to the Empire, so splatter their blood all over the shop pronto. To help you in your goal, you can start off on the Training Missions which vary to the Campaign proper because in Training you have command over your fellow Terminators, and the mission briefings are far more specific. It's in the Training, Classic and Famous Missions that you can become au fait with combat readying yourself for the main campaign. ZEEKI . "


"REVIEW SPACE HULK I COMING TO A PC NEAR YOU The original Space Hulk on PC probably looks somewhat dated now as it was basically more strategy-based than anything else and didn't really have the freedom of movement that you have in 3DO Space Hulk. This will not be the case with Space Hulk II on PC CD though, which is planned to be released in January of next year, as it's based on the 3D0 game. SCORES VERDICT WWWWWWWWW} 3D0 No doubt all 3DO owners out there are awaiting Doom to arrive on their Interactive Multiplayers, but as I seem to have played the aforementioned on just about every format (including a quick bash on the forthcoming PlayStaion) I'm quite ready for something a bit different. And that's certainly what Space Hulk is, the number of missions is phenomenal, and it's not the sort of game that you can just plough straight in to as there's a lot of tactics and skill to be accrued in the training and classic missions before going on the final missions. The detail of the aliens and the superb souind atmosphere really show you what the 3DO can do, they're excellent and this is a more than worthy 3D0 game. GARY LORD ME DOOM... SPACE HULK.. WOLFENSTEIN. GRAPHICS........93 'Tremendous' is the word that springs to mind, as well as 'bloody'. ANIMATION. .... The aliens move super fast and the FMV is pretty slick too. WHAT'S HAPPENING Your stats screen will tell you what's happening, and basically to your left and right are the weapons that you currently have; also how much Freeze time you have (a kind of limited pause-and-think mode). How much of a battering you're taking will appear in the bottom right of the screen, which will deplete if attacked with Bolter shells but will be revived if you manage to keep out of harm's way. Keep an eye also on the Experience bar as those Terminators with more experience are naturally better fighters, especially in close combat.

In Japan some of the biggest names in sports commentary lend their distinguished oratory to add realism to Konami's products. Powerful Pro Baseball uses this, as does the original ISS aka Perfect Eleven in Japan. CRS reflects the action on field so that great shots are praised and foul play condemned by the guest commentator. Likewise the noise level of the crowd is in tune with the drama of a big game. Though the original ISS sounded impressive, it didn't actually make use of CRS in Europe because it was considered too expensive on memory. Now, for the first time, players can experience the difference CRS makes! ISS Deluxe features double the number of voice samples, plus additional sound effects such as samba beats on drums, and chants from the stands. It's brilliant! 26 "

There are more options, management sections and strategy elements than you'd believe. Sadly for us monolingual types, however, they're all in Japanese. As a result, whilst the boxing sections (when you get to them) are pretty smart, it's impossible to tell what you're actually doing.

Trust us to reveal all... 3D SHOOT-EM-UP. ACTIVISION .99 OUT NOW. TWO PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNEO AVAILABLE o, you're not dreaming MechWarrior 2 really does exist. I know it's hard to believe after all, fans of big battling robots have literally been waiting years for this game's release but now, at long, long last, it's finally here, angrily stamping about, knocking over tables and shooting things. But what took Activision so long? I have a theory... You see, when a young lad begins his working life, it's customary for his new colleagues to make his first day a humiliating misery. Usually this aim is achieved by giving him 'impossible' tasks to achieve and then laughing at him when he can't do it. For example, one might ask Mr Wet-Behind-The-Ears to go to the MechWarrior 2's glossy intro sets the stores and get a can of 'stripey paint' scene perfectly — take that, robo-scum! (tee-hee!). Another wit might order him to fetch a left-handed screwdriver (hoot!). Then, of course, there's the telling him to ask a workmate for a 'long weight', whereupon the poor wretch is made to stand around looking like a lemon for an hour or so (a long wait geddit? Grench!). And it's my belief that this last fate befell the novice programmer of MechWarrior 2 the problem being nobody remembered to tell him it was just a joke, and so he ended up spending months just idling about, kicking his heels and doing nothing. Still, it looks like the poor geezer spent all that thinking time wisely, because he's come up with one corker of a game. It just took forever! 30 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG Can anyone work out how that big 'Mech squeezed through the tiny door way? A REAL CLAN FAN MechWarrior 2 takes place in a brutal future where two rival warrior clans', Wolf and Jade Falcon, battle for galactic supremacy. This war has raged for centuries, and each side's fleet of battleships has been so severely devastated that 'conventional space warfare is no longer viable. So now combat takes place on every contested planet's rugged surface, with each side trundling to war inside BattleMechs. These giant man-o'-wars resemble the two-legged Scout Walkers from the Star Wars movies, but boast a far deadlier range of highly sophisticated weaponry. The game gives you the option of playing as a member of either Clan, and there's a different set of missions to tackle depending upon who you choose. These missions are all linked plot-wise, and your performance in them either culminates in you being proclaimed ruler of the Clan — or reviled as the cause of its downfall! Take care: you'll need at least a Pentium to get MW2 looking anything like this good. (LITAS NELAS ERMED 60 LRMOD Death to dental plaque!

Although MechWarrior 2 is an out-and-out blastfest, there is a small but important strategy element too. For a start, it takes a lot of firepower to destroy an enemy BattleMech outright, so often it's wiser to cripple a Mech by shooting its legs and then coming back later to finish it off at your leisure. Later on in the game further tactical complications are created by the introduction of wingmen'. As their commander, you can give your fellow MechWarriors a variety of orders which they will then attempt to carry out to the best of their abilities.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG BETILLA THE FUN SCORES IL VERDICT. PLAYSTATION Jaguar owners should maybe buy this game. Everyone else, forget it unless you bought a 32-bit machine to play 16-bit games. Even then Rayman doesn't come close to Yoshi's Island. We have Clockwork Knight 2 on Saturn, and Jumping Flash (still) on PSX running at CVG, with a new 16-bit stunner Super Mario RPG on the way. Nobody here has any incentive to lead Rayman through 70 levels of seen-it-done-it and tricky sequences met by little reward. These are old ideas dressed in the emperor's new clothes. PAUL DAVIES | Tum APRIN With the aid of Betilla the fairy, Rayman soon learns more tricks, to please not only himself but the player keen on discovering all the secrets his game has to offer: Telescopic Fists: For his size, Rayman a has a reach greater than Frank Bruno! This has a lot to do with the fact that Rayman's fists aren't attached to his body in any way. Which is kind of eerie, but useful all the same. The longer his pui the sh Grippi Ledges forms! ously s of reac Rayman become available with his gripping hands. These doubl sort of life-saver should Rayma tally stumble off the edge of af Helicopter: It's difficult to prec what's below when hurtling ton ground. This is where Rayman's hele-'do' comes in handy.

Nobody Great Protoon looks evil Mr Dark takes it notices it's missing. This is because everybody in Rayman's world is an Electoon a tiny creature used to gravitating around the Great otoon. Now Rayman has to reunite the Electoons with the at Protoon, kick Mr k up the ass, and . the peace. Simple enough? Well the Electoons are all locked away in guarded cages. Add to that the fact that Rayman can't reach many of the cages until Betilla has granted him a certain ability. Each location hides six cages, and the only way to progress through to the final level is to find every one of them! Rayman is a veritable visual feast, though not very 3D. ANIMATION.. No 32-bit animated trickery, but sprites moves smoothly. MUSIC Superb on Saturn and PlayStation. Cool on Jaguar too. SOUND EFFECTS.. 77 Ubi Soft liven things up with many humorous touches. GAMEPLAY. A testing enough game, but ultimately 16-bit dulldom. Golden medallions allow Rayman to monitor how many Electoons he has found. Each has six spaces to fill, and only when all the medallions from the first five worlds are complete is Rayman given access to Dark's Candy Chateau! VALUE Despite being predictable, Rayman is still a fair challenge. OVERALL It's a cutesy platform game, but unfortunately it's not one with a difference: just a jazzed up 16-bit title. Oh, but it is a very big game. For Jaguar owners only. 35 "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW TI Ulll MEGA DRIVE 32X FIGHTING ideo gaming occupies two extremes there's 16-bit (pretty crappy by today's standards) and 32-bit (Saturn and PlayStation both being incredible). Lurking in between are the Jaguar and 32x, both machines uncertain as to which category they should occupy. However, judging by the quality of the games on offer, the systems would tend to be nearer to the crap end of the scale. Perhaps things might have been different for the Sega upgrade if Virtua Fighter on the 32X was available when the system was first launched. As you can see from the shots, there have been some sizable compromises in the graphics, but other than that, this incredible conversion includes everything else from the original coin-op AND even betters it in one or two regards. All of the characters from the coinop are in the game, and every move has made its way from arcade to 32X. That's a gargantuan 700 different moves to master and it must be said that even months after getting the Saturn version, EMAP's resident VF experts are still finding one or two more on the odd occasion. Remember: any tactic you work out on this 'baby' version of VF is 100% guaranteed to work on any of the two Saturn versions or on the arcade game itself! You can't say that about many combat game conversions.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG VERDICT.... PLAYSTATION Could this awesome game be the swan song for the Mega Drive 32X? Virtua Fighter successfully translates all of the important stuff (like the gameplay and the animation) on to the 32X and although the graphics aren't as good, they certainly do the job. With VF2 and Tekken about, this isn't likely to convert any one to 32x, but for owners of the system, it's a God-send. LAI HIEU Pai's father has much the same range of irritating PPPK combos at his commands, and while he isn't as fast he has some astounding moves that result in multiple-hit strikes. Best of all is an unbelievable eight-hit combo! His throws only work at very close range, but when they do work, they inflict much damage. Overall, one of the most powerful fighters in the game. PAUL DAVIES AKIRA YUKI There is no doubt that Akira is one of the most difficult characters to control. This situation is remedied somewhat with the 32X version, mainly due to the excellence of the Mega Drive six-button joypad. Akira is the most powerful close-quarters fighter, and has some stunning, super-energy draining special moves that incur huge damage when used as counter-strikes. WINNER SECOND OPINI Virtua Fighter is an incredible two-player experience and that remains the case with the 32x game. In fact, the extra tournament modes make VF sessions an even more socially acceptable event. Considering the limitations of the hardware, 32X Virtua Fighter is stunning and should be purchased by any one who owns the machine unless you want to put the money towards a new Saturn, where you get a superior version of the same game free. WINNER OTHER VERSIONS VIRTUA FIGHTER The story here's the same as with the Game Gear version. Obviously the graphics in the 16-bit versions are of a higher quality, but every. thing else small. KAGE MARI The ninja of Virtua Fighter has perhaps the sneakiest artificial intelligence of all computer players. He also has the most spectacular range of moves at his disposal. However, Kage's combos aren't that great, and his throws are neither powerful or easy to pull off. Although initially quite interesting to sad fops taken in by his good-looking moves, Kage is basically crap! SATURN An excellent conversion of the Model One arcade original, although the European PAL version is a tad lacking in speed. SATURN REMIX Redresses the glitches of the first version and boasts textured characters. The PAL conversion excellent. Apart vede's foot. WINNER "


"REVIEW K.0.3 | JEFFRY MCWILD Any one who practises an ancient Roman fighting art called Pancratium is bound to be quite an interesting character! Although Jeffry is the slowest fighter in the game, he is by far the most powerful -with only Wolf rivalling his range of incredible throws. Along with Akira, Jeffry is the most difficult character to master in the game, but as experienced VF players will tell you, this has its own rewards... FEET FIRST It's only a small point but all PAL Virtua Fighter conversions so far have had some characters with their feet on backwards! It only occurs with one or two fighters in their victory poses, but it's clear that when AM2 were speeding up their motion capture for the slower PAL systems, something went amiss. Most prominent on Kage, the same fault is in 32X VF, the bundled Saturn VF and in Saturn VF Remix! Yes, it's that close to the Saturn version!!! WINNER JACKY BRYANT The perennial favourite of Virtua Fighter is in fact a lacking character who has the speed of Sarah, but not her range of devastating combination strikes. Japanese experts have had to be extremely cunning to get any sort of technical mastery out of this particular character, Still, he's better than Pai or Kage. MEGA DRIVE 32X: DEAD OR ALIVE? WINNER Originally put together by Sega of America, the Mega Drive 32X was designed to be a mini-Saturn which would be the only affordable 32-bit system on the market. History has shown that the machine is clearly lack, ing in the 3D area and offers little more than extra 2D capabilities to the standard Mega Drive. The lack of a truly incredible new game really let the system down when it was first released, with the parent Japanese company keeping all of the best Sega arcade titles for Saturn only. Things didn't improve with the likes of Cosmic Cornage, Motocross and the god-awful Motherbase a trio of truly evil products that turned many off the 32X straight away. Virtua Fighter on 32X shows that the machine is capable of producing some excellent software, but the lack of new games remains a problem. In fact, there are only four promising titles for 32X in the lead up to Christmas. Cheapness is in the 32X's favour, but more expensive 32-bit machines such as PlayStation and Saturn are certainly more powerful (like, try ten times more powerful: 32X does 50,000 polygons a second, Saturn 500,000 that's Sega's stats too). While VF is a step in the right direction, it's clear that Sega's future is in Saturn. Virtua Fighter 2 on Saturn features full texture-mapping and 60 frames per second movement. You'll never see that on 32x. If it's gaming with a serious future you want, the extra monetary investment in a higherspecced 32-bit system will reap rewards in both the short and long terms. PAI CHAN In a word: irritating. Pai is the fastest character in the game by far and has a bewildering array of PPPK combos at her command that enable her to best most characters in a repetitive, boring fashion. Adding to the irritation factor are her counter-strike throws, which turn an opponent's punch or kick against them. ER "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG SCORES 2B2 SHE SARAH BRYANT A powerhouse of sheer aggression, Lau is the only character who is equipped to take Sarah Bryant down. All of Sarah's moves are keyed to attacking key points of the opponent's at differing heights, thus making her exceptionally difficult to defend against effectively. Probably the first character you'll finish the game with. CHILDREN exceptionally difficult to defend W YET MORE NEW STUFF To make up for compromises in the graphics, Sega of Japan have added various extras to keep players amused. Included in the line-up are the tournament mode, plus the ability to change character colours as well as the option of replaying the entire bout! Other intriguing extras include the 'squeeze' mode, which gives the characters the same proportions as the arcade fighters, but reduces their size. It's a very curious effect, and somehow they look that much better when squeezed. INN E R VF ON 32X.... VE ON SATURN... VE ON ARCADE... GRAPHICS Stylish as ever, but much blockier than the original. ANIMATION Superb! We're flabbergasted by the quality of this feature. MUSIC Fair renditions of the so-so coin-op themes. SOUND EFFECTS 95 Virtually identical to the originals. Slight reduction in clarity. WOLF HAWKFIELD Another of the large, but powerful brigade. Wolf seems a superior fighter to Jeffry on paper, with three superdamaging throws and a whole host of other, less powerful ones. His scooping punch and knee blast moves offer quite a lot of potential for combination attacks and you can even execute some of his moves while blocking. GAMEPLAY 94 The sort of game you play 'til the cows comes home. VALUE We've played Saturn VF for over a year and this plays as well. OVERALL Reason enough to buy a 32X with no regrets.

And you will too once you jam your new PSX disc and start playing NBA JAM in a 32-bit stylee. Alright you may have played NBA in one of its lesser 16-bit guises, but that's by the by because this game was one whole lot of fun on Mega Drive and SNES, and things haven't changed on PlayStation What was so great about NBA when it came out was that it made the basketball seem sooo playable. Each game is basically a two-on-two challenge, and because the ball never really goes out of play the gameplay is kept at a constant pace. It's all about scoring as many baskets (goals to you and me) as possible and each match is divided up into four (each quarter lasts for three minutes) with you against one other player (or the CPU). However you can have four of you play if you've got a Sony Multi-Tap. What's so spesh' about the Tournament Edition though is the inclusion of various 'Hot Spots' and 'Power Up' icons. It's these power-uppy additions which can have a devilish effect on your opponent, as you become a Jammin' and Shootin' mayerick as you tread on an 'S' and your speed increases, or a 'T' will give a player unlimited turbo, whereas tread on an 'F' and you're set ablaze in a dunkin' mayhem of three point heaven.

Fun for all the family! 10010 hen things are going well, people say that they're 'running like clockwork'. These people have obviously never used a clockwork device in the entire of their sorry lives, or been on a train, which they probably also believe run smoothly and without trouble. What a load of rubbish. Clockwork toys are famous for moving at stupid hyper-speed at the beginning phase of winding, gradually slowing to a pathetic whirry crawl at the end. They can't even maintain a consistent pace at any stage. If Clockwork Knight were in any way realistic the main character would peg it about four inches along a platform, stumble up to the edge and then stop, dead, whereupon a giant hand would pluck him into the air, begin the winding process and then discard him. Indeed, most people did discard Pepperouchau the Clockwork Knight when his first eponymous adventure hit the Saturn. One, because no-one had a Saturn anyway, and secondly because it was a trés boring game. But he's back, he's very back, he's the backest thing you've ever seen and he's hoping to redeem himself in the same way as Street Fighter. But can he do it? Or what? KNIGHT 2. CLOCHWORK KNIGHT...

MUSIC Excellent songs with stunning lyrics, plus top in-game sounds. SOUND EFFECTS..91 Sometimes very fitting, sometimes just funny. But good. -(VERDICT SATURN The original Clockwork Knight was a load of rubbish, so I was surprised to find myself actually enjoying Number 2. The first level is pretty quintessential Clocky Knight, but stick with it and there's an abundance of ace ideas lurking in each stage. Whilst it's about the same size as the original and of comparable difficulty there's more to keep you occupied and encourage you to return once you've completed the thing (and it's worth completing for the ending). Not a serious challenge, but certainly an enjoyable one. RAD GAMEPLAY 90 Takes a little while to warm up, but there's more to later levels. (VALUE..... .. On the short side, but there's enough to go back and see again. 149576 Lucky in cards, unlucky in love, that's what they say (whoever the sinister 'they' are). «They» certainly seen to have a lot to say. Well anyway Clockwork Knight proves this theory quite neatly. To wit the toy he loves is repeatedly kidnapped, whilst collecting the four playing cards secreted within each level brings him nothing but good fortune. However, we're as yet unsure just what good fortune (apart from a points bonus) nabbing them actually does bring, as you have to collect EVERY hidden card in EVERY level to reap a megabonus at the end of the game. If you find what it is, please write in and tell us (although we'll have found it ourselves by then). OVERALL If it were twice the size this would be a classic. But it's perhaps a little too midgety for top players. Still ace though, and at least worth seeing. KNIGHT 2. 45 "

If that stirs mixed feelings within your soul, let us remind you why this is so. Microcosm was once the singularly most impressivelooking game on PC and Mega-CD. It was a 3D shoot-'em-up developed by Psygnosis which overlaid sprites on to a full-motion video (FMV) backdrop. Sadly the gameplay was thought to be poor Novastorm runs along similar lines. Except this time we have Fractal Engine Technology to boost the FMV, along with a tad more interaction with the scenery. Sure it's a different scenario outer space opposed to inner space but the concept is largely the same. What's immediately so distressing about all this is we're now two years down the line from a flawed concept, and it's being tried on us again. Explaining the gameplay doesn't take long. Basically, lead a space craft into battle through eight stages of swarming aliens. As is tradition for shoot'em-up ups, super enormous boss characters hang out at the end of each stage. The action is viewed from behind the craft, as it flies toward its interstellar goal. Due to the angle employed, the action is necessarily uncomplicated. Too vacant to really grip you, but enjoyable at first. 00005 20 VALUE. Buy any other Psygnosis game apart from this one. Beautiful to look at but not play we're afraid.

Of all the class titles Psygnosis (aka Sony Interactive) have produced, for PlayStation, Novastorm is by far the least inspiring, Though we appreciate what they've set out to achieve, the end result isn't destined for Hall of Fame status.

"REVIEW MEGA DRIVE Ah, Mr Bond, I trust you will excuse my rather audacious choice of entrance. PLATFORM SEGA EUNCONFIRMED OUT OCTOBER ONE PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE VECTORMAN Don't Write Off The Megadrive Part 1000... raditionally maths has taught us that vectors are all to do with straight lines, logical point-topoint plotted lines which your dad would like. But Sega, those wily games types, are reversing the trend with their latest title. For the hero, going by the name of Vectorman, is made of distinctly spheroid shapes, close cousins of all round things. And get this, numeration fans they're not even joined up properly. Who says computer games don't ruin your education? Although, actually, perhaps Vectorman is just a nickname given to our android pal as a youngster. Perhaps in the usual style of 'irony', like calling tall kids 'Shorty' or fat kids 'Not a disgraceful no-self-respect slob at all', as you do. Or perhaps because, true to his high-tech form, Vectorman was the proud possessor of a Raleigh Vector talking bike with ace electronic control panel on the crossbar and 20-odd different kids of electronic bell/buzzer/beeper/wild animal mating calls. Or whatever. Oh, who cares. KILL YOUR TELEVISION Vectorman might be the produce of Gamos, but he's a bit of a radical anarcho-libertarian at heart. The main thrust of Vectina's mission is to destroy a number of evil TVs dispersed around each level, thereby freeing the masses from media slavery and allowing them to rise as one and smash the bourgeois state. Just to make sure you get the message there's a Pavlovian bonus icon awarded for each telly smited. These include energy boosters, whirly invincibility energy fields and extra weapons.  5:58 TORE 48 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG THE TRANSFORMED MAN The good thing about being made of unconnected spheres is it allows you to be expressive with your body shape. Sadly though, robots aren't known for their imagination, so it remains for power-up icons to suggest shapes. Perhaps turtle-shape (for faster underwater movement), drill-shape (for burrowing into inaccessible cayerns) or even bomb-shape (wait for the counter to reach zero and wipe out everything on the screen). Be warned, though Vectorman has a short memory, so transformation is temporary in the extreme (ie about six seconds). VERDICT. SEGA Budding evil genius types don't make your henchmen from rocks. They're toss. What really infuriates me about the Megadrive is that, as GunStar Heroes proved all too long ago, it's capable of far more than most of the tat that hits the shelves. Yet no-one can be bothered to stretch the machine when they can cop out with a crap licence or 'cute' platform character. Well Vectorman has neither of these qualities, but it's absolutely great. The graphics are stunning, the game design shows -shock horror real imagination and it's hard enough to challenge any player, no matter how experienced (and jaded). One of the best releases of the year, and a great demonstration that, quite frankly, you can stick Bubsy the Bobcat up your arse. RAD GET TANKED UP The other good thing about spheres is that it doesn't matter which angle you view them from they look the same. This means clever games like Vectorman can warp the play area to whatever degree they fancy. This trick is best evidenced by this groovy overhead-view tank level. Vecto has to blast the evil grabbing hands of a fully scaled boss monster whilst riding a tiny thin rail which warps and twists as the stage progresses. The ultimate aim is to destroy the fingers of doom and cause the nefarious mechanoid to plummet to the floor way below. GRAPHICS ANIMATION MUSIC 96 SOUND EFFECTS. 90 GAMEPLAY. 94 VALUE OVERALL 55:5 As you can see, Vectorman shows off some rather fantastic light-sourcing effects. Cor ber-limey. 49 "


"REVIEW SNES BEAT-\"EM-UP Ultimate Combos deliver an auto No Mercy in place of an Ultra. Discover which secret special technique triggers the move, and tag it on to the end of a legiti. mate combo for results! NINTENDO .99 OUT NOVEMBER 1-2 PLAYERS NU 64 FOLL OW-UP PLANNED ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE t's open season now, so far as the official market is concerned. There's no playing on the ignorance of a PlayStation/ Saturnstarved public any longer. SNES Killer Instinct is out there fighting against Toh Shin Den, Tekken, and Virtua Fighter this autumn. Nintendo are claiming this is an even match up. Well, CVG is happy to consider this notion for as long as it holds up in this, the authorative CVG review. NO MERCY NO SHAME! Whereas the basic gameplay in Kl is indebted to Street Fighter II, the finishing moves ('No Mercies\") are influenced by the Mortal Kombat fatalities. Each fighter is armed with at least two of these techniques, and, just like Mortal Kombat, they are executed to massage the victor's ego. No Mercies are more cinematic than MK fatalities, however; an example being that Shao Khan's unceremonious dumping of a foe on to a bed of razors is matched by TJ's exhibitionist Chiropractor. Even so, there are sig. nificantly less opportunities for such gags in Kl as there are in Tobias and Boon's pride and joy Humiliations included. KILLER INSTINCTES \"Too late,\" was the cry! Both Saturn and PlayStation are on sale RIGHT NOW while Nintendo trail behind with thefr 64-bit machine, and postpone the release of Killer Instinct. Too late. Too late. Or is it... 50 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG VERDICT. (Top Left) Orchid activates forgotten algorithms in Fulgore! (Middle) A flashy end to Miss B's big-hitting Ultra! NINTENDO That Killer Instinct is still pulling crowds, even after the introduction of MK3, says it all. You could argue that Kl has less features, but to me the game is better. kl has a superior graphic style, more amazing sounds, and there's a significant difference between characters. The gameplay is more instinctive too. Complaints that Ki is too combo-orientated are pretty naive. Kl is the only beat-'em-up to introduce a combo-breaking system to deter smart players from having the tide turn on them. Given the choice, would you allow an opponent to double the potential of their specials? Of course not! My only reserve is that Ki is little more than a hybrid of some of the best fighting games around. But when it's done so well, and on a 16-bit machine too, who cares! BURP! 'Scuse WOOPS AN ULTRA Ultra combos take no more skill than the simplest two-in-one. Which is often why players find them by accident! They're 'Finishing' moves, that's all -like the Ultimate Combos. When your opponents' energy is down to the last sliver of red, simply tag a single, special technique to the end of a basic combo and the Ultra is yours. That said, alongside the slo-mo death of SFI, or the MK fatalities, there is no better way of watching losers get wasted! SHADY DEALINGS Not all the modifications' in SNES Killer Instinct are to its advantage. Shadow Moves are crucial tactically in the coin-op; they're still here, but the method of execution's changed. Like the coin-op, Shadows are specials that are doubled in power, post Combo Breaker. In the coin-op Shadow Moves involve holding a button then releasing it after the technique, making it necessary to rethink your combo strategy mid-game. On SNES just the standard moves are used. To some this may be good news, but those looking forward to brandishing the coin-op's Shadow Combos don't have the chance. EYEDOL SITUATION The secret code to play as Eyedol is revealed to players who master the game on the hardest setting no matter how many continues used. So, unlike Namco's Weapon Lord where you must master all six Warriors before playing the BOSS, KI simply needs dedication to one favourite character. GRAPHICS KUT THE KRAP! ANIMATION MUSIC Rare weren't lying when they said the home version would play better than the coin-op: and no-one realised they were talking about the SNES! Regardless, the final version has a refined combo regime, under which Eyedol's 80 plus hit juggle is impossible. The modifications allow for extra 'Linkers' between specials, meaning there's potential for higher-scoring Ultras in the mix! SOUND EFFECTS. 90 GAMEPLAY VALUE AIR COMBAT With a mid-air challenge in Kl there's the risk of being combo'd! Fighters who begin with a Fierce Low may two-in-one with one of their specials to gain multiple hits. Fulgore's Plasma Slice and Jago's Wind Kick are among them. OVERALL 51 "

But what we have here is more of the same, and although the new tracks are all very challenging, and have some excellent new track designs, it is merely covering old ground. The construction custom set is a novel idea, and you will enjoy making a couple of tracks of your own, but I don't think it adds anything substantial to the gameplay. Time for that old adage if you haven't got the previous incarnation then buy this, otherwise there's not much more to it. RACE POSITIONS! Hello. Rad here. You know I was the first person to review Micro Machines. GARY LORD 52 "

"REVIEW PLAYSTATION SOCCER SIM KONAMI. .99 The intro looks splendid and is kept nice and short. hen you buy your PlayStation (or Saturn we're not machineist here at CVG), and you've bought Wipeout, Tekken and Jumping Flash the next piece of software you're going to have to add to your collection is a decent footie game. Now, if you're a Saturnite you're going to have a problem as at the moment, the only thing on offer is the lacklustre Victory Goal. If, on the other joypad, you're a Stationer then you're in luck as Konami have surpassed themselves with the terribly playable and addictive Goal Storm. Gameplayers who know their onions will undoubtedly recognise the screenshots as last month's rather top Winning Eleven, and there'd be a good reason for that, in that this is the European version of said game. It's virtually identical to the Jap original and it doesn't take you long to master the controls and start performing vicious sliding tackles, diving headers from corner crosses and some rather spectacular overhead kicks as only Goal Storm knows how. This is of course the English version but not much has changed as the game still has quirky orientalisms like the way the players bow their heads at the ref when they commit a misdemeanour; you certainly wouldn't catch the good citizens of Osaka chanting 'Who's the merchant banker in the black' now would you? OUT NOVEMBER TWO PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE It's taken Japan by storm in its other guise Winning Eleven but can it do the same to our Anglicised PlayStations? GOALSTORM REPLAY I LIKE JIMMY HILL The main difference to the Anglicised version (apart from non-Japanese players) is that you get fully controlable action replays, so that you can really wind up your opponent as you show him how you waltzed past his defence and scored in the last five seconds of injury time. "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG SCORES GUATE DESMOND LYNAM IS A GEEZER The commentary for Goal Storm is comedic, but for the wrong reasons in that it's just how a Japanese person would envisage us Brits to speak, ie in a Mr Chumdley Warner type accent. Some choice commentary includes «That's a rocket,» and «Good stuff goalkeeper\" and \"Corner Kick\"! I actually prefer the Jap commentary, as this one is just embarrassing. WINNINEN MUURIMITI | VERDICT. PLAYSTATION DAYTONNA USA... RIDGE RACER..... GRAN RACER Shiny happy people scoring goals. GRAPHICS........90 WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BRIAN MOORE F International Superstar Soccer showed that Konami can make a football game. And Goal Storm demonstrates that they're not gonna let down their patrons, on the Next Gen consoles. The sound effects might sound more like they should be in a beat-'em-up, and, that players are playing on concrete rather than grass, but that doesn't detract from the arcade playability of a great game of footie. Get a few mates round and there'll be some shoutin' and a hollerin' that hasn't been heard since since Sensi Soccer ran on to the pitch. The only drawback is the appalling English commentary that's been tagged on, it will have you cringing big time. Apart from that, it's grrreat. GARY LORD Very polygonised and very slick, with a trés Japanese style too. -------TEAM SELECT ANIMATION... Great movement on the pitch and some fab set anims. Just so that you don't have to play as Granpus 8 or any of those other comedy Japanese teams, Konami have put a load of other jolly foreigner teams in instead, such as Argentina, Holland and Wales. MUSIC U.S.A Whatever you don't throw the ball, always go for a goal kick. Nothing really to speak of apart from the opening track. LIL SOUND EFFECTS..90 Somewhat bizarre but enjoyable nonetheless. 70 1:58 GAMEPLAY 95 Konami have got it just right in this category and no mistake. (VALUE Use the sliding tackle and your opponent will come down with a thud and a crack. For your first footie game it's money well spent that's for sure. -OVERALL.... I think we actually underscored this game last month as it's incredibly addictive, there's a whole host of shots to perform just turn the commentary off! Farma GOAL! JONATHAN PIERCE IS A RIGHT HORNY BLOKE Score a goal in Goal Storm and your team will run off like stampeding wilderbeast, in all their polygon glory. If it's a depressing nil-nil draw then I'm afraid it's down to penalties. Will he go left or will he go right. (Actually he went down the middle.) 55 "

ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE JAX WINS FLAWLESS HANG TSUNG It's back! Again! For God's sake, how many more times? I can't stand it! Tom Cox of Sega Mag gets down at the disco. veryone these days is banging on about how great 3D beat-'em-ups are, including me. But hey these 3D games are still displayed on TV screens, aren't they? and TV screens only display two dimensions, don't they? So that means that yer Virtua Fighters and Tekkens are still, at the heart of it, very much two-dimensional titles. But then, the ways in which the characters move around and interact with these environments gives a convincing illusion of depth, long believed to be the elusive third dimension. So does this mean computer games have re-written the book on spatial geometry? Is it possible that in the future children will be born in 2D and have computer chips attached to them to add substance to their form? Just think, this could alleviate the world population crisis at a stroke, as an infinite number of depth-free humans could occupy a single space at any time. If everyone faced the same way. So we could all live in the same house, which would surely eliminate territorial wars too. Although it might mean a bit of a crush for the bathroom in the mornings. But there's always someone around spoiling things for everyone. And in this case it's 2D beat-'em-ups like Mortal Kombat. Aside from polluting the minds of our youth and indoctrinating them in evil paths of violence and mayhem (not to mention bad hair) stand in the way of more sophisticated research into girth reduction. Shame on them. MORTA 56 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG WINS. OS WINS: 00 WENT NON-PC PC Whilst the PC version isn't in such NIKS:00 KANG SOVYA an advanced state of completion as the (finished) PlayStation Mortal 3, we've gotten hold of a variety of lovely shots. As you can see, it's shaping up rather nicely. The gameplay remains to be tested, but given the sterling job done of converting Mortal Kombat 2 to the same platform we doubt there'll be too much trouble on this score. But then, GT Interactive are handling this port-over job, and it's their first time with the Mortal mantle. So how will it do? Be sure to read a forthcoming CVG for the full scam. KINS-00 Sub-Zero's Ice Clone move is sure to fox anyone. Except people who can see in colour, because it's blue. But it'll fool dogs. With blocked-up noses. That background looks pretty splendid, doesn't it? I like the look of that. SUB-ZERO God knows what's going on up there, but it looks like great fun.

They say it's to keep us fit at school, but we know it's just training to help us escape monsters. Some people like running and make careers out of it. Some people are unfit and hate it and just get jobs in computer games and let little computer sprites do the running for them. That's us. Luckily Mortal 3 incorporates a lovely exercise-dodging feature in the form of a Run button, instead of double-pressing a direction like you normally would there's now only a single button press required to leg it across the screen. As you might expect this comes into action quite a lot for Fatalities and such. WINS 07 STRYKEN 2 WINS:00 SUBZER WINS 01 JAX WINS: 00 KANO JAI WINS L KOMBAT 3 57 "


"REVIEW IN 02 SUS ZESO MEET THE GANG One of the main reasons for Mortal Kombat's original and continual success has to be the imaginative character design, which plagiarises all manner of B-movies, comics and myths for inspiration. Hi-tech cops and robbers, zen ninjas, ancient gods — you name it, they've got a reason for showing up at the Kombat tournament. Mortal 3 introduces some new friends and fiends to the roster (although it drops a couple too). Here's a rundown of the new faces, in case you haven't seen them before. SINDEL Whilst her hair doubtless goes down a storm at the Goth gigs it's also a very useful grappling weapon.

But even without flash polygon graphics and the wonders of texture mapping Mortal Kombat 3 still, stands tall on the playability rostrum. The new depth of gameplay offered by the revised combo engine, adds an extra dimension of challenge, and the special moves and -Alities are all as over-the-top as usual, It's hard to fault Mortal on any grounds other than the fact it's been superseded by a host of more advanced games.

Mortal 3 is so proud of its improved comboing abilities it displays on screen exactly how many hits a combo scored, and what percentage of the enemy damage meter it destroyed.

"REVIEW EW CVG SUPER NES FREAK 'EM OUT VIACOM 007800 on ETBC OUT NOW ONE PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED PC, MACINTOSH. GAME BOY MEGADRIVE, SATURN, AND PLAYSTATION VERSIONS AVAILABLE es indeed, Mr Alexey Pajitnov (inventor of Tetris) approached programmers Hookstone at a recent trade show and proclaimed their game the best thing since his own genius work. Those who survived Tetris fever better prepare to get totally Zooped, because the game looks set to become MASSIVE! Players control a triangular chip which occupies a box in the centre of the screen. This box is surrounded by advancing rows of coloured shapes, and the chip prevents them getting too close by striking out to eliminate them. Chameleon-like properties enable the chip to adopt the shade of whichever surface it comes into contact with. Shapes only disappear after being struck by the chip when it's the same colour; otherwise the two just swap shades. Of course 99 levels of difficulty, combined with nine speed variations ensure that this simple operation doesn't stay too simple for very long! On Super NES and MegaDrive Zoop is a one-player experience. However the Game Boy supports a two-player option, whereas PC and Mac versions allow as many as four people to network machines for a multi-player experience. We're not certain as yet to how the PlayStation and Saturn versions are configured, but we'll let you know as soon as we find out. Whatever situation you find yourself in, depending on which machine(s) you own, Zoop is an experience like no other. Puzzle fans welcome the new breed of brafn bender! Viacom's Zoop is a better game than Tetris. We know, because the guy who wrote Tetris says it's true. HOEDD D :D  0083 100.00.00.00-161 2010/100.00-1 AJA 10/100 GRAPHICS ANIMATION (VERDICT...... SNES Original ideas are few and far between. Zoop is not only innovative, it's fresh and incredibly addictive too. Aside from the stylish visuals, which you're neither meant to love or hate, the basic gameplay is a stroke of genius. It's ironic that a game, destined to become one of the greatest of the decade, is about to do so without need for X-amount of light-sourced, texture-mapped polygons, or CD-quality sound. No matter what format you're running this on, Zoop is an essential ingredient to spice anyone's collection. PAUL D .80 75 1000800 333 0113 tureSOUND EFFECTS. 70 PSST... LOOK OVER HERE! GAMEPLAY. 94 ----VALUE OVERALL One final thing we feel we ought to warn you about. Even before making a move with that chip, the chances of striking out in the right direction are slim. This is because Hookstone have devised the Optichallenge a series of 10 backgrounds that incorporate optical illusions to deceive the eye. While shapes advance from one direction, the background pattern tries to focus attention elsewhere. Even once you're wise to the Optichallenge it's still tough maintaining concentration on the real danger areas. As the game progresses, so does the complexity of these sneaky designs! "

Yes, in Magic Carpet 2 there's yet more trouble afoot in the unsightly shape of Vissuluth, a mighty demon from the Netherworlds who is attempting to cross over into your dimension. As you can imagine this would not be a pleasant event, so you must travel to Vissuluth's dark domain and defeat him before he and his nightmarish minions invade. So the scene is set for mystical mayhem a-plenty as you fly your magic carpet through 25 levels of super-fast 3D action, collecting powerful spells to destroy Vissuluth's hellish forces. All in some of the most spectacular ways ever seen in a computer game. «Hang on, you're thinking, 'this sounds just like the first game!' Ah, but it's not. You see, this time around you complete each level by performing special tasks set for you by the ghostly form of Kafkar, your Obi-Wan Kenobi-ish master, so there's a more adventurelike feel to things. Oh, and there's loads of new spells to cast and monsters to fight, as well as new terrain types to explore too. Good, eh? 63 "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW BRAVE NEW WORLDS! There are three different types of terrain for you to fly over in Magic Carpet 2, each of which subtly alters how the game plays. The first is very much like the landscape in the first game, except that there are patches of snow everywhere. The second is a landscape shrouded in darkness, making it easier for the nasties to sneak up and ambush you. The third is underground, where the narrow passages and tun nels make it harder for the player to out-run the enemy's attacks. IT'S A DIRTY JOB BUT... Throughout the game the ghostly grand wizard Kafkar acts as your spiritual guide, popping up now and again to give you advice and tell you what tasks you must complete next. These range from destroying castles to locating magical teleport gates oh, and killing millions upon millions upon millions of Vissuluth's monstrous henchmen. (Interesting but strange coincidence: Kafkar sounds just like the actor Richard Burton who is dead, just like Kafkar! Spooky, eh?) "


"REVIEW (VERDICT.... PC CD-ROM SCORES WIZARD JAPES! As the game progresses you encounter rival wizards loval to Vissuluth some of the deadliest foes you'll ever meet. Although you can shoot them out of the sky, they resurrect themselves after a short while, provided that their home castle is still standing. The trick is to blast them to kingdom come, then seek out their base and destroy that before they get a chance to be reborn. The same holds true for you, though, so it's vital to ensure that your castle is protected at all times. I never played the first Magic Carpet, so I approached this sequel with a degree of scepticism after all, thought, how much fun can flying some tatty old bit of Axminster be? Well, after only a few minutes of play! found out lots! The game's speed and fluidity is sim ply awesome you really feel like you're flying while the incredible spell effects just have to be seen to be believed.

DOING IT WITH YOUR MATES! If your PC is connected to your mates' machines over a network (and you've all got a copy of the game!) you can play Magic Carpet 2 head-to-head, with each of your carpet-surfing wizards in a battle to be the last man standing. Of course, it's not something that everyone will be able to try but if you get the opportunity leap at it it's an incredible laugh and intensely exciting. I loved Magic Carpet, and so I was moist with antici pation for this sequel and I'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint. Bullfrog have managed to improve almost every aspect of the original; the graphics and sound are vastly improved, the gameplay is much more structured and the new spells and monsters are mind-blowing. The only downer is that for an old rug master like me, it's a little too easy to complete. Still, it's (carpet) bags of fun while it lasts, so I'm not com plaining too much. Fantastic. RAD 65 "

When heading down a steep incline, keeping the nose down increases velocity. However when rising out of this it's necessary to pull up to prevent scraping the chassis on the road surface. Another trick is using the forward/ back movement of the craft is when gaining extra distance over a jump: a little extra lift is gained by pressing forward then pulling back a little before coming to land. KEY POINTS Record 1. After a Turbo start (see separate paragraph,) prepare to jump on he air brakes as you reach the first bend. 2. The majority of Speed Ups encountered are on the left-hand side as you climb the hill. Only go for weapons power-ups if your position needs salvaging. 3. As you plummet toward the dip in the tunnel marked by the Danger sign, pull the nose up to prevent it scraping the road surface. Veer right to clip the no-risk weapon power-up. 4.

Usually it is better to adopt the route involving the most speed-up grids, though desperation might force beginners to rely on weapons. Throughout this guide the options are explained for you.

STICO 2-PLAYER LINK STRATEGY Head to Head competitions are won and lost on weapons skill, no doubt about it. Best way of stopping a player's fun is to observe their strategy first, then exploit their weaknesses. Racing out in front the whole time is risky, which is why experts hang back for two laps, keeping the 'enemy' in sight, before loosing a missile in the run up to the final stretch. Two people going for the same gag kind of forces speed to take a back seat, though! 00:23. OVERTAKING Enemy craft are programmed to block your path, but take a moment to recognise your existence. Choose your moment, then lure your obstacle to the extreme left or right lane. Now quickly move out into the opposite lane and power ahead. Sportsmanship, as a rule, isn't written into the F3600 code. 'Revcon' is most effective on pilots negotiating tricky chicanes. Use of this icon when rivals have an open stretch ahead of them is totally wasteful! 'What's This?' disables an opponents' weapons recognition system.

"ARCADES In the coin-op world, the Japan Arcade Machine Manufacturer Association (AMMA) show is the event of the year.

VIDEO FIGHTING VIPER FIGHTING VIPERS Beat-'em-up 1 Sega I 1-2 Players PLAYER SELECT UOMINIQUE WIN OATHI PLAYER SELECT GRACE DOMINIQUE AND BAHN A metal sheath adorns Dominique's forearm, which she uses to lash out at foes. Same goes for the shin-guard. Dom looks pretty lowly compared to Bahn in his princely attire. So far as we know Bahn has no weapons except, of course, his fists. ONISKU PICKY' AND 'GRACE Picky keeps a skateboard strapped to his back, which he uses to smack his foes all about with overhead swipes. For protection he depends on skate armour. Grace is a roller-babe, her shin pads shield her slender legs while dishing out extra damage too. RAXEL AND 3-MAN Unfortunately we have no pics of Raxel the long-haired guy who wields a guitar. 3-man, however, is seen here taking a beating from Picky. He looks like a cross between a riot-cop and an American footballer. THE FACT THAT FIGHTING VIPERS COMES FROM AM2 SAYS IT ALL. It seems the wait for Virtua Fighter 3 is extended. as this is obviously where the Yu Susuki team's energies have been focused of late! Vipers is a 3-D fighting game developed for the Model 2 board. Comparisons to the Virtua Fighter series are inevitable, but there are many unique features to Vipers. First obvious difference being that the characters wear gang-land skate, and club gear as opposed to traditional martial arts attire. The choice of colours here is much brighter than VF2, and the special effects accompanying moves are far more extravagant. Gameplay is also notably faster, ensuring that adrenaline levels soar almost immediately. Looking into the gameplay, the most immediate change to VF2 is the presence of enclosures. So Ring Outs are gone, and in their place a far more acceptable technique of being able to smash opponents against the wall. This is achieved in a similar fashion to Sarah's FlipKick Combo, where a succession of punches culminate in the 'pin.' Certain combinations of moves, when used at the close of a match, can even hike fighters right over the top! What do you do when your back's against the wall? Well, each fighter has a Killer Instinct-style breaker which allows them to get out of trouble either by throwing the aggressor off balance, or slipping out of reach. Some fighters are able to use weapons, though not at all in the same way as Namco's 'Soul Edge.' In Vipers, weapons adopt the form of Skateboards and Guitars! Read the miniature profiles to find out some more on that. There's no getting away from the fact Fighting Vipers plays similarly to the Virtua Fighter games. But CVG gets the impression AM2 wouldn't want it any other way they want this game to be accessible. If this means keeping it \"easy' at the base level, that's fine. Besides, we're almost certain Vipers has many hidden depths. It's coming to Saturn, and you saw it here first! JAMMA SHOW HIGHLIGHTS 74 "

Evidently the standard of graphics has improved yet again, and the control system has changed accordingly. The designers have taken the Virtua Fighter route and implemented just three buttons: guard, punch, and kick. From this you can gather that most moves are performed in the Street Fighter 2 Fatal Fury style, plus there's the ability for some characters to sidestep attacks à la Toh Shin Den. So far we have seen eight characters, The Barbarian with the axe is called Rocky. More heavy-duty kit is wielded by Siegfried, a Knight, and Mitsurugi, the Samurai. Mina flourishes a Bo. Taki bears close resemblance to a Ninja and Vold is the ageing mutant bladesman. System 11 is proving itself ever more capable of matching Sega's Model 2 just look at those amazing structures in the background! Also significant about Soul Edge are the lighting effects, which Namco are especially proud of. Day turns to night or vice versa in the final round. Flares trace the moves of special attacks.

Now instead of having to spend  plus for hardware and software, you can sample both for a fraction of that price. By the end of the article I was halfway to cloud nine. Then I read the next two pages and came across a piece called 'Rent Boy' and after reading it I hit the ground like a lead balloon. Why? Because the article questioned whether or not games machines will be required any more. I've been an avid reader of CVG since the classic era of the Speccy and intend to continue reading when the likes of the Ultra 128 and M6 Accelerator hit the shelves. Your zine has been my biggest influence on which games to buy. It's a piece of gaming history and I hope it will remain to fight companies who try to release 'dodgy' games to take advantage of the new rental system. Long live CVG. John Allen, Carrick Fergus, North Ireland CVG: Sob, sob (sound of hanky filling noisily). You're too kind. Seriously, if you re-read the article, we're not suggesting that CVG's days are numbered perish the thought but that certain lesser 'zines might be in trouble. Fear not, John, we intend to continue our tradition of professional, insightful games coverage for many years to come. Seems you lot are on a role with all your technical knowhow cantankerous opinions of late! If things carry on this way there'll soon be a mag called in the Bag on the newsagents' shelf with a small section called CVG inside! Which do you think is best, Saturn, PlayStation, or PC? We need to know! Send your letters to: My Advice to You, In the Bag, CVG, Priory Court, 3032 Farringdon Lane ECIR 3AU. SUNNY SIDE HAND-HELDS SOMEONE LOVES US SHOCKER Dear CVG, If portable hand-held machines are wasting too much power, why not make them solar powered? If there's no sun (which shouldn't be too often), you could stick batteries in them then. C McDee, Fife CVG: There actually was a short-lived trend in solar-powered hand-held games back in the mid-Eighties. However, while that's fine for one-screen games with five frames of animation, it's simply not practical for a modern release like Donkey Kong Land. The solar cell for one of those monsters would be hard enough to carry on your back, let alone hold in your hands! "


"LETTERS hay LETTERS CVG ALEX SAY THAT PUBLIC SAY ORDER! ORDER! Dear CVG, I am sure that the PlayStation will win the format war and intend to buy a UK PlayStation as soon as possible. Sega are martyrs to the consumer and are dogged by failed ventures because the public do not know what they want. 'What?' I hear you shout, but think: Public say: \"We want 16 bit.\" Sega release Mega Drive. Within 2 years of the SNES' launch, it has outsold Mega Drive. Public say: \"CDs are trendy.\" Sega release Mega-CD. No-one buys it. Public say: «Next Generation costs too much.» Sega release 32X. No-one buys it. Public say: \"We want 32-bit.\" Sega release Saturn, a rush job which is generally considered second-best. I feel sorry for Sega. Meanwhile, Nintendo have made it company policy to ignore public demand eg waiting until now to release Yoshi's Island. Too late, Mr Miyamoto, I sold my SNES a year ago. Sony on the other hand have produced a powerful machine, are releasing at the right time for the right price, have the software support cheaper than Sega or Nintendo... need I go on? OK, Sony have no experience as videogame manufacturers, but as Atari's track record proves, you don't have to be inexperienced to be clueless. Alex H, Manchester KOKTELLER WMNS AINCT HUMAPINHA FLASHES Dear CVG, I am a 15 year-old Ugandan boy and a total video games fan. I have read two of your issues which I loved and from which I got your address. I would like to order your August '95 issue or the back issue where you reviewed Donkey Kong Country. Unfortunately I don't have any access to order forms SO could you send some so that I could order? || would greatly appreciate it. Thanks for your time. Katawonga Kizitio, Kampala, Uganda. ADDER THAN TUSON 1ST TEKKERS CVG: Hmmm. The issue of how much manufacturers should be swayed by public trends is an interesting one, but Sega's Mega-CD and 32X failed for far more boring reasons ie the software support was utterly crap! As for the Saturn vs PlayStation question, it's much too soon to say...

Hope that helps. wwwwwwwww ETGLUGE HIRSE DI SEOUTES THE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING Dear CVG, When is this barrage of Next Generation machines going to stop? I want to buy one, preferably a PSX, but am worried that something else new and lush, i.e. Ultra 64, will be the best machine in a year making my machine outdated and poo! Things are going so fast that one minute you're playing a lovely texture-mapped polygon-fest of a game for   and the next there's a new machine, same price as yours, running ray-traced, lightsourced graphics with lens flare and real time! I don't know whether to buy or sit on my fat arse missing all the fun. Tom Hughes, Wallingford, Oxon CVG: Some people are never happy, are they? Present them with a load of cutting-edge machines to choose from and they whine 'cos they can't decide which one to have. Our hearts bleed... All we can suggest is the obvious: read up on the machines you're interested in (preferably in CVG), try a few shop demos, wait for the official releases and decide which bit of hardware suits YOU. And think games. Remember, the most orgasmic texture-mapped graphics won't be worth a ZX81 if the gameplay stinks. 79 "


"CVG HELD CONTROL FREAK Dear Help! One of my friends is about to sell his American SNES with a few games and a couple of pads and I'm interested in buying it. Thing is, I already have a PAL SNES but only one pad and want to know if it's safe to use the American pad on the UK machine? I know this might sound like a dumb question but I remember reading something a couple of years back that said it was dangerous to use American or Jap pads on PAL machines. I'd be grateful if you could tell me as I much prefer the indented buttons of the American pads to the UK one. Cheers. Karl Moody, Dunston CVG: Actually your question isn't as stupid as many readers might be thinking. A couple of years back there was a rumour that using non-country specific pads on different machines might either damage the SNES, the pads, or both. Rest assured it doesn't affect either and we swap pads all the time here at CVG. If only using American games on a PAL machine was as easy KWESTIONS EL QUE Hi Help! I've have a few questions about the awesome Killer Instinct that I'd be grateful if you could answer for me. 1. I read in another magazine that the American version of KI will come with a CD of tunes from the coin-op. Will this be the case with the UK version of the game? CVG: We doubt it, but it is possible considering the steep  price tag. 2. I read in the same magazine that Cinder had been chopped from the SNES version. Is this true? CVG: Kind of. Cinder was originally taken out because of lack of memory space. Rare know that he's the least popular character and figured it wasn't too much of a loss if the freed up space allowed them to incorporate everything else from 007000 WIL WU23 the coin-op. However, being the programming Gods that they are, they've not only managed to squeeze in all the code but somehow find room for Cinder as well! 3. What size will the cart be and is it bigger than DKC? CVG: 32 Meg, the same size as DKC. 4. And finally, is the SNES version as good as the original coinop? CVG: Yes, it's very faithful considering the massive technical difference between the humble SNES and the custom built and pretty darn expensive coin-op hardware. Be warned though, the PAL version is quite slow in a Streetfighter kind of way. Lee Grogan, Sheffield NOSTALGIA FREAK Education can be fun when it's CVG's 'Help!' pages. So, whether you want to get the lowdown on Killer Instinct or a DIY CD-ROM kit (!!!) these two infoheavy pages should be your first port of call to an A grade pass in anorakology. Dear CVG, I'm probably considered to be one of your older readers (I'm 34) and am desperate to play some of those classic 8 bit Spectrum games. Unfortunately I got rid of my Speccy a few years back and am finding it surprisingly tough to track down a decent second hand one. I've read about C64 and Spectrum emulators in the Amiga mags (Iown an A1200) and would there. fore be grateful if you could answer the following questions. TITIITTITITITE 1. What sort of price are the emulators and do they come with any software? CVG: The price varies considerably but for around -20 you could expect to get either a Speccy or Commodore emulator with 100+ games. 2. Do you need any additional hardware to run them? CVG: No, the emulators will run on even a bog standard A500. However, because these are emulators the games will run much faster if you have an accelerator as the processor won't have as much work to do converting the original 8 bit code to something the Amiga can understand. 3. Are emulators illegal? CVG: Quite probably yes, although you could argue that the PD companies and emulator creators make little cash out of them. 4. Are there other machine emulators available on the Amiga? CVG: Yes, you can get MSX, BBC, PC, Mac emulators and probably others too. Joseph Coots, Bristol 80 "


"HELP CVG 7201 32X WORRIES Dear CVg, As a 32X owner I'm becoming increasingly despondent at the way both software houses and the public alike seem to be continually slagging the machine off and saying it has no future. I'm seriously considering selling the machine along with my Mega Drive 2 and software collection and upgrading to a Saturn. However, before I do, I'd be grateful if you could answer these questions and put my mind at rest. 1. Do you think the 32X has a long term future? CVG: To be honest, the answer has to be no. As you say both the software houses and the public saw the 32X as a stopgap and have waited for superior machines like the PlayStation and Saturn to appear. We'd be very surprised if the 32X was still doing much business a year from now. 2. What do you think of the 32X conversion of Virtua Fighter? CVG: Well, we haven't seen a finished version, but what we have seen looks superb. Obviously the graphics aren't quite as detailed as the Saturn version, but the animation is just as smooth, and there are NO glitches! Quite an achievement we reckon. 3. Is there any other good 32X software worth hanging around for? CVG: The Scavenger Team stuff looks very cool (as always.) 4. Would you lot rather buy a Saturn or PlayStation? CVG: It's much too early to say. Though CVG is astonished at the quality of the initial PlayStation line-up, there's equally amazing stuff coming down the line for Saturn. We've played Sega Rally, seen Virtua Fighter 2, and they are UNBELIEVABLE! So, we suppose the answer to this question is: 'Keep reading CVG! Steve Formby, Liverpool (ABOVE) Virtua Fighter on the 32X plays identically to the Saturn version. Not bad considering the massive price difference between machines! STATION SNAX CROWN JEWELS Dear Help! I can't wait to get a PlayStation next month and I've got a couple of general questions that I hope you can answer: Dear CVG I have a collection of old CVGs that I don't have the room for anymore. Do you think they would fetch much money? CVG: Hey, every issue of CVG is priceless folks!!! But seriously you don't say how old the magazines are, how many you have and what condition they are in. Why not try putting an ad in a games mag or perhaps the computer section of a local paper and seeing what kind of response you get. Mark Reegan, Cornwall BARON ALOHA 1. Will Datel or some other techy company come up with a CD or something that plugs into the memory card slot which allows you to play games from the USA and Japan? CVG: Apparently this is proving very tricky to do, but if anyone can pull it off then it's Datel. 2. Can you use saved positions from Jap games on their English equivalents? For instance my mate has Jumping Flash saved on his Jap PlayStation and I wondered whether I'd be able to copy his card once I get the PAL version of the game. CVG: It may work with some games, but for the majority it won't. There are quite a lot of changes made to games when they're converted from NTSC to PAL so it's likely that you'll have to play the game through yourself we're afraid! 3. If I buy an English SCART lead, will I be able to use it on my mate's Jap PlayStation? CVG: Yes. 4. Will there be PlayStation games that come on more than one disk? CVG: Yes, Novastorm and Wing Commander 3 for instance. It's not yet known how much more expensive, if at all, these multi-disc titles will be. Clem Parish, Suffolk. HELP! G HBORBOLT 0028713 "

November 90% complete STOLTH No other versions planned No other versions available PLAYSTATION SENANCE agile wari-ior: It sounds like an SNK beat'em-up, but it's not. So there. f111x TEK lul THERE'S A POINT in every young boy's life when he dreams of being a fighter pilot. Fortunately this is usually just a passing phase, otherwise the world would be chock full of fighter pilots and there'd be no-one to work in kebab shops, which would be a disaster. But there are some people (generally those who later take jobs in the RAF) for whom fighter piloting remains the focal ambition of their lives. Now, given the danger level inherent in this career (almost that of kebab work) it might be a good idea if these chaps got into video games instead. For starters they'd spend all their time sitting in their rooms in the dark, straining their eyes and wasting their muscles to a point where they'd never pass the Air Force medical anyway. And for finishers they'd be able to indulge their soar-and-swoop fantasies without having to kill anyone or be killed themselves. And then we'd lose loads of wars and end up as woad-wearing slaves to a despotic post-apocalyptic warlord with an eyepatch. Anyway, this is straying from the point a bit. What we're leading up to is the fact that there's a new air combat game coming out for the PlayStation, hot on the heels of Namco's rather natty Ace Combat. It's from Virgin, which is a good sign, and it's called Agile Warrior: FILIX. And we're going to tell you a bit about it. ululull All on flight BZ4203 are about to become charcoal. Aim, fire, miss and then aim, fire and miss again. BRIEF ENCOUNTERS If only Hans-Karloff Megasedee had thought about the terror he was unleashing upon the world when he launched his eponymous add-on, we might all have been saved such a gruesome fate. Yes, we're talking about FMV, and Agile Warrior is the latest game on the scene to employ this nefarious device. Each mission kicks off with a fully FMVied briefing in a secret bunker, with those weird seethrough map board things. And, for once, it's pretty good. 83 "

"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG 0908 Flea, flea you fools! franticap flea leas are scary little horrors. It's a good job they prefer things with fur to slinky smooth human skin, or I'd be living in a permanent state of terror. As it is I steer clear of woolly jumpers, fur collars on jackets and gorilla suits. Although this has as much to do with vague dress sense as fear of parasites. But fleas ugh. Look at one of those close-up micro-camera pics of a flea's face and you're staring into the eyes of an armoured and extremely mobile creature which feasts on the living flesh of its victims. Why anyone would think them cute and decide to base a game around the adventures of an heroic member of the species (as if there could be such a thing) is beyond me. Why, my head is itching just writing this. The sooner I finish, the sooner I can get home and have a bath in some bleach. So, to the crux of the matter. Gametek's Frantic Flea is the first game they've licensed from Haus Technika, and so impressed are the Brit softco that they've signed the fledgling (ie unknown) programmers for a further six titles. Hopefully none of the future carts will feature parasites, arachnids or long falls into pits of snakes and crocodiles, or I'm not covering them. WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT, ALF-FLEA? Frantic Flea may look like a platformer, but behind the pretty-looking 60s Warner Bros cartoon style graphics beats the heart of a puzzle game. You play Frantic himself, an insect on a mission to rescue a collection of tiny baby fleas from the clutches of evil alien machines, so they may continue to lead lives of liberty and gore-sucking. The technique is easy enough. Leg it around each level collecting baby fleas (which follow you around) and when you've got enough to complete the level (the numbers increase as the game goes on) go to the exit. However, each time you collide with an enemy you lose all your fleas, which wastes precious time. Run out of chrono-units and it's game over. SNES PUZZLE. GAMETEK EUNCOMFIRMED.

"PREVIEW HEXEN Developed by:............Raven EHEKEN Released by: ....................GT Out .November -95 100% complete Playstation and Saturn version planned No other versions available 55100 THE MENTION OF ID has any serious gamer foaming at the mouth in anticipation of some serious videogaming action. The small, Texas-based company revitalised the PC games scene with one release: Doom. Featuring lashings of awesome violence and realism, the game went on to break all records. Enter Raven Games, well known for their RPGs. Eager to jump on to the Doom bandwagon, the firm became the first to licence the Doom technology and created Heretic a more mediaeval Doom which was a whole lot tougher. BE 100 200 E ow Heretic is back in the form of Hexen a game which takes the Doom engine to its limits and improves upon the gameplay in ways that id's competitors can only dream about! Make no mistake, Hexen is a major videogaming event. The game is superior to Doom in just about every department. Boosting the RPG element is the fact that players can now choose between three different types of character: Warrior (great close quarters combat, crap magic), Mage (exactly the opposite) and Cleric (a sort of hybrid between the two into 'healing'). Each character has a different range of weapons. Also apparent is a greater sense of questing'. Instead of completing single levels, players can now move between levels at will, retracing steps to find hitherto concealed items and their ilk. Part of the quest involves constructing your superweapon. These are awesomely powerful creations, split into four pieces and found throughout the game and again, there is a different super-weapon per character. The range of artifacts has also been boosted to incredible degrees. As well as the usual flying artifacts and suchlike, it's now possible to create guardian creatures which follow you about, actively seeking out and destroying enemies for you. Speaking of enemies, you'll find that the opposition in Hexen is far more intelligent than in Heretic (meanies will actively distract you while others of their number sneak up from behind and perform unmentionable acts on your sorry ass!) and they're far more powerful too. With the release of games such as Hexen, Fade to Black and Screamer, the PC is quickly becoming a gaming platform of gargantuan proportions. However, all of these epic titles could be superseded by the awesomeness of id's latest game. Quake will be released next year and threatens to redefine 3D gaming as we know it. However, until then, Hexen more than delivers preposterous amounts of 3D battling thrills. Expect no, demand! a full review in the next edition of Computer and Video Games. 88 "


"PREVIEW CUG PREVIEW 100 Hexen is a graphical masterpiece and really shows how dated Doom has now become. ALL-NEW NETPLAY Co-operation and Deathmatch are, historically, the two multi-player options available in Doom and its ilk. This hasn't changed for Hexen, but the gameplay is far more complicated. For a start, the programmers are looking at increasing the amount of players in a network game. Doom had four players on at once expect to see six to eight players in Hexen. This means that Co-operation (the most unused feature in Doom) actually becomes quite interesting. Just as in Dungeons and Dragons, you can assemble a team of real people warriors taking the point of your onslaught, with mages at the rear and clerics darting between the two, healing the injured. The new character classes also makes Deathmatch a lot more intriguing. As well as the usual free-for-all experienced in Doom, it's now possible to create two teams of three people (maybe four) to fight against one another. Add in the computer-controlled guardians, such as the mighty minotaur (and every character can have one) and you have the opportunity for carnage on a scale never seen before in a PC game. Oh yes, pants will surely be exploding when Hexen is released on October 31 (that's Hell-o-ween, by the way). Additionally, GT the game's publishers have announced a worldwide Deathmatch Hexen tournament! 200200 Hexen takes the Doom engine to its limits by introducing more realism into the game. There's far more background detail and now doors open inwards and outwards. EEST 100 200 200 200 200 The gameplay in Hexen isn't linear as you can dip into and out of levels as you wish. Each character has their own super weapon that needs to be built as part of the game's quest. 89 "


"CVG PREVIEW PREVIEW Electronic Arts Preview Special VIEWPUINI Developed by:Visual Concepts Released by: .............. ..EA Out ..........November '95 Realise the potential of your new machine with these games just three from a whole bunch of amazing stuff from Electronic Arts! 607 complete No other versions planned No other versions available PLAYSTATION VIEW POINT It's exciting how the power of the new consoles has inspired companies to break tradition. Ocean have seen the potential in the Raiden project a hard-core shoot-'em-up way different from their usual stuff. Likewise Electronic Arts, while maintaining their sporting tradition, are publishing some pretty diverse titles this coming year. Here's a cross section of three major titles in the mix. Maybe you thought Neo-Geo was only good for beat'em ups. Well there is one game on SNK's still-mighty console which shakes that idea to the ground. Viewpoint is an innovative take on the shoot-'em-up theme, in which fantastic polygon-based worlds scroll into pseudo-3D view. On PlayStation the game takes on a whole new lease of life as the surreal visuals become weirder still, thanks to extreme texture-mapping of the rendered images. There are six stages in all, which is standard fare these days. They're short compared to those in Raiden, but the difficulty and sheer wow factor more than compensate for this. Unless you've already played the Geo version, this really is like nothing you've seen before. The animations are incredible, so too are the stunning stage settings. Ingenious obstacles, including mechanisms activated by cannonfire, require players to think about this shoot 'em up in a fresh new way. Viewpoint is such an incredible game. We know of at least one person who bought a Neo-Geo just to play it, and the guy who conceptualised Virgin's 'Spot Goes to Hollywood' took his inspiration from it. Are you salivating for this yet, or what! Four varieties of super-bomb are used to decimate the alien forces: Cluster Bombs home in on their prey, a Fire Wave incinerates anything in its path, and a Seismic Blast quakes the liv. ing shinola out of anything within range. 90 "

Released by: ...................EA .November '95 Pus pe 90% complete Saturn version planned 300 version available PLAYSTATION Road Rash isn't just a game anymore; it is a rock 'n' roll institution! Whether that's your bag or not, this special edition of the gas burner on PlayStation packs one mean engine! We're not assuming too much here by comparing Road Rash to Ridge Racer; only on bikes, and with ten times as many circuits to burn! Then there's the music of Soundgarden, Monster Magnet and Therapy (among others) to spur you on. Just like 3DO Road Rash, EA are including music videos of this revised selection of grunge-meisters brewing up a storm as part of the deal. Essentially PlayStation Road Rash is very much the same as the 3DO version, which in turn is a much improved adaptation of the rusty old Mega Drive version. But, just as the graphics have advanced, there are added incentives to feeling lowdown and downright dirty in the saddle. It's open season where pedestrians are concerned — you don't get any points for knocking 'em over, but you can do it all the same! Knowing your enemy improves your chances of satisfaction also, so it's good to see the Jimmy Hill brigade have returned as guinea pigs for a good... er, rashing! Alternative routes make for short-cut opportunities, while also extending the longevity of the game's appeal. izle Height: 6' 1\" Weighi: 163 lbs Bike: Corsair Swallow Cash: $200 A model bad boy, cup and ruthless.

Released by: ....... EA SPORTS Out ................November 95 80% complete Versions planned: 300, PC CDROM, MEGA DRIVE AND SNES This game is so photo-realistic you can almost feel the breeze flapping in your ears! So the two courses featured — three on Mega Drive and 3DO feel as close to being there as any golfer could wish for. PLAYSTATION The Public Relations chap from Electronic Arts is an ex Pro Golfer. Why are we telling you this? Well because the look of sheer pleasure on his face when demonstrating PGA '96 says it all! While the team were clamouring for another shot at Viewpoint, Mr EA sat transfixed by the pleasant greenery and growled 'Fuz-zzee' every now and again. He was referring, by the way, to Fuzzy Zoeller one of 14 professional players who have been digitised into this revamped version of PGA TOUR Golf 486. New features include a 'revolutionary' Targeting Arc System (which is a basically a fancy replacement for the dotted line in previous versions), plus there's full-motion video biographies celebrating all 14 pros individually. Yet more FMV is used to preview the courses, then there's a real-time hole fly-by which enables players to view the course from any angle. Of course the biggest selling-factor with PGA has always been its proven gameplay, and our golfing guru at EA has every confidence in it. SLOELLER 91 ZOELE "


"CVG TIPS NEO GEO THE KING OF FIGHTERS '94 What a modestly titled game huh? Still, it has to be said that this is one of the better thumpers available on the sadly neglected Neo Geo. However, there's one notable and very annoying omission from the home version and that's all the blood and gore. But wait, all is not lost, for there is a cheat that squirts the blood back into the game as Rob Simons reveals with this code: At the ranking screen, press and hold A and D on CONTROLLER ONE and B and C on CONTROLLER 2. All the blood should now be yours along with Mai Shiranui in her original arcade guise. ZE MEGA DRIVE IEEE BLOODSHOT Hello once again crazy gamesters and welcome to another four pages stuffed with plenty of games cheats, hints and tips. And not just any common or garden tips, we've got fertiliser-fed up-to-the-minute ones, packed with goodness. So grab a knife and fork, gorge yourself, enjoy and we'll see you in four weeks or so... TU Hmm, which is better, Bloodshot or Zero Tolerance? Personally I'd go for the latter but as Accolade thoughtfully kicked the bucket at the start of this year resulting in games shops being a bit Accolade product free, you're kinda stuck with the former. This isn't as bad as you might think if you're unfamiliar with the game though, it's a pretty good stab at a Doom clone considering the crumbly old techno innards of the Mega Drive. In fact things get even better once you input this great selection of codes sent in by Colin Pritchard from Elleridge. Take it away Col...

"TIPS TIPS CVG JAGUAR MEGA-CD HOVERSTRIKE EARTHWORM JIM SPECIAL EDITION How's about a plethora of cheats for this so-so Jag game? Oh, alright then. All these cheats must be entered at the mission select screen by the way... Aah, if only all Mega-CD games had been as good as this, instead of the same game slapped on to CD for a tenner more, then perhaps the Mega-CD wouldn't be on its death bed. You'll have to excuse us for being bitter, but it's late at night and we want to go home. David Taylor cheered us up no end by supplying all the level codes to Shiny's finest to date though. Unlimited weapons, shields and energy: Press 4 and 6 together. For a level skip press: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 together. Gain extra lives by: Pressing 3, 6, 9 and # together.

NOOOOT! Well, the gag title of this fump'em-up may be a bit ancient and Carry On like but the gameplay certainly packs a big punch. Make it even harder (titter) by entering (ha-ha) BALLBLURBALL during a fight. This will make the balls turn translucent. And if you try entering LARDBALL you should find that your balls will increase in size (ooh, matron please!). 32X NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB Monk CH Fear not 32X fan, 'cos Tips doesn't discriminate against machine owners, even if there's only one of you out there. Ha ha, only joking of course. Or are we? Bit of postmodern irony there. Anyway D Lang from Gosport has been kind enough to supply these cheats for Acclaim's Madden beater. They should be entered on the main menu screen and go like this: 1 For Acclaim and Iguana teams press: B, C, A, C, A, B, C, C, A. To get AFC and NFC teams press C, C, B, A, C, A, B, B, C.

"CVG TIPS 3DO SNES WARIO'S WOODS THE NEED FOR SPEED There you were, chest super proud, thinking that you were the greatest in the world at the game everyone is calling Wario Woods, but you were wrong. You see we've managed to uncover a super, mega-hyper ultra-tough level which really is a bit on the tough side. To access it, highlight VS COM and hold LEFT and press START. There should be a bomb explosion-type sound if you've done that correctly. Now, once you actually start playing the game you should begin to feel less smug and generally a bit weedy, 'cos this is one rock challenge to face. Come to think about it here's another good reason for buying a 3DO and it's the man with a great taste in software again, Mr Dan Thompson, who provides this smart cheat. As the loading screen appears, press and then hold LEFT and RIGHT SHOULDER PADS and L. Now, once you've started a game, PAUSE and then QUIT. START a new game and at the loading screen press and hold LEFT and RIGHT SHOULDER PADS and UP. START another new game and PAUSE and QUIT as before. Start a third game and at the loading screen press and hold LEFT and RIGHT SHOULDER PADS and DOWN. Don't quit, but release the buttons and start racing. Now, whenever there's slow moving traffic in front of you a quick tap on the X button will send it flying in an A-Team stylee! SNES SUPER PUNCH OUT This is another of those games that's been splitting us reviewer types over wever it's like good, or not. Personally I'm quite fond of it, so much so that I thought you might be interested in sharing these tips sent in by Ed Parr from Cornwall. Basically they point out the most effective place to target each of the characters in the game: SNES UN PUTTY SQUAD Gabby Jay: HEAD Bear Hugger: Rapid punches to HEAD Piston Hurricane: STOMACH Bald Bull: HEAD Bob Charlie: HEAD Dragon Chan: Rapid punches to HEAD Masked Muscle: STOMACH Mr Sandman: HEAD Aran Ryan: ANYWHERE! Heike Kagero: Rapid punches to HEAD Mad Clown: Rapid punches to HEAD Super Machoman: HEAD Narcis Prince: HEAD Hoy Quarlow: HEAD Rick Brusier: HEAD, then dodge right after hitting him Nick Brusier: When his feet stop moving this means that he's about to lash out, so be careful! Once he's finished concentrate on his HEAD. Next time round he'll attempt a super punch. Again wait for his feet to stop moving and duck to the left. Finally, when he jumps backwards, side-step the first punch and then duck Nick's attempted blows to your head. Once you've avoided that lot you should hopefully be able to finish him off. Wahoo! So, you want extra lives and a level skip do ya? Well, do ya?! OK, then give a big hand to Adi Mallerd from Stockton for supplying just such a cheat. To access it, simply pause the game and press R, A, L, L, Y. Now you should be able to skip a stage simply by giving the trusty old select button a quick tap.

"CVG SATURN MEGA DRIVE DAYTONA USA TOUGHMAN CONTEST 'Blue, blue sky'... ARRRRRRRRRRRGH! I wish someone would teach that bloke how to sing! Anyway, those Daytona USA tips keep rolling in and here's a particularly smart cheat for those who are finding the final level heavy going but want to play as the horse. It was sent in by Allan 'Double L Please!' Hare from the Isle of Man. He suggests pressing A, B, X, Z, START and UP-LEFT together when the white Sega logo appears. Along with horsey, this will allow you access to all the cars in the game, particularly useful when going for the time trial records. Thwaack! That's us here at CVG punching this fairly limp wristed excuse for a boxing game. Still, if like Mike Binns from Manchester you were a bit sad and went out and bought it you might help console yourself with these tips. To make them work, go to RESTORE FROM PASSWORD in the SETUP MENU and enter E then two of the following letters which represent your opponent and your boxer respectively: L: Jabfare El Habib M: Coco Valdez P: Joe Wildhawk Q: Biff Blublood R: Nikolai Rainski S: Diego Garcia T: Hauvan Jones U: Yang Ahchi V: Sydney Dundee W: Gavin Gregson X: Rigo Suave Y: Chang Fu Z: Jacob Jabowitz 20 8:283389 OPERA A: Bruno Maserati B: Monsieur Victorie C: Hans Fischer D: Charlie Ponderosa E: Benny Booyah F: Meurte Martinez G: P J Rock H: TK O'Reilly J: Hiro Sokitome K: Coolio Loc 3DO SATURN CLOCKWORK KNIGHT RETURN FIRE This platformer may sport some superb visuals, but it's severely lacking in the gameplay department. If you want the playability to match the on-screen sexiness then hang on for Bug!. However, if you've been suckered into buying Clockwork Knight already then Allan's back with some more handy cheats, all of which should be entered on the title screen. If ever there was a reason to buy a machine simply for one game then it has to be Return Fire. Mindless destruction at its finest all accompanied by that amazing Dolby Surround soundtrack. Dan Thompson from Kent says he wants to marry the game and has clearly managed to squeeze out information for an invincibility cheat whilst courting it: 9. 004 003 For a level select: L, U, R, D, D, R, R, U, RIGHT SHOULDER PAD. To warp to final boss: Enter the LEVEL SELECT code above and then press: L, R, R, U, R, R, U, D, R, R, U, RIGHT SHOULDER PAD. And for a whopping 999 lives: Enter U, R (nine times), D (six times), L (seven times), Z, X, Y, Y, Y and finally Z. START a game and go to the craft selection screen. Highlight any craft and press C and HOLD DOWN BOTH L and R buttons. Whilst holding them press and HOLD B and C. Still holding all four buttons press STOP. This will take you to the exit game option. From here (still holding down the four buttons by the way), push down and if all's well you should hear a sound. Repeat the process for each craft you wish to make invincible. And there's more. For a level select, start a new game and go to the map selection screen. Keep pressing UP until you reach the password entry screen and then enter WOLF as the password. 95 "


"   ) CHALLENGE Lever Hax ANTALONNBOWANIA TOMATIC VEDEO AUTOMATIC THE ULTIMATE HAMES CHALLENGE Hello there, hardcore gamestrels. This, as you might have noticed by now, is the CVG Challenge Page. This is the place where we, CVG, challenge you, the readers of CVG, to send in your toppest best gaming achievements in the hope of finding a place in the finals of our ULTIMATE GAME LORD CHALLENGE. Now there seems to be a little confusion among certain sectors of our usually bright following as to what exactly we're asking of you. So to make things extra clear, we're going to give you a run-down of the all-new rules and regulations. Firstly, we set a bunch of challenges straight from the bowels of Satan, such as Daytona time attacks and Mortal Kombat double-flawless dares. Lots of people seemed confused as to whether you could use cheats when attempting these. OF COURSE YOU CAN'T BLOODY USE CHEATS. What's the point in having an Ultimate Game Lord Challenge when any pinhead with an Action Replay can bung in a couple of codes and whiz straight through? Eh? Next, realising that the challenges were a little unfair on those people who didn't have the games concerned, we decided to throw the tournament open. You can send in an impressive score or achievement ON ANY GAME YOU LIKE. But we do require documentary evidence of your skill, such as a photograph or video of your score/game. DON'T SEND THIS IN with your initial entry. If you're good enough to go into the finals we'll write and ask you for your proof. If you don't send it, you'll be disqualified immediately and someone else will take your place. But don't worry about that yet. You've still got about eight weeks to get your entries in. Some of the ones we've had so far are pretty impressive, but we're sure they can be bettered. Remember, all the finalists get to travel down to Namco Wonderpark in London to compete for the title of Ultimate Game Lord and a rather fabulous prize to accompany the glory. Right, so, to recap. The rules are as follows: 1 Yo may enter your best score or achievement (ie double perfects against beat-'em-up bosses, superb completion times for games etc) on any game you wish. 2 You must be able to prove your entry but DON'T enclose your photo/video/memory card with your entry. 3 You can't use any cheats of any description. Anyone found to have employed so much as an extra life code will be disqualified. 3 Wait for us to call/write to you, asking for your evidence. 4 Send it in and wait for us to invite you to the final/dismiss you as a fibber. 5 Your entries must reach us by JANUARY 1 1996 in order to be considered for the competition. 6 No correspondence or phone calls will be entered into. You'll just have to keep your mouth shut and be patient. 96 "
