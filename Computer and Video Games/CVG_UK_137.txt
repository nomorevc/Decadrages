"STOP PRESS! NEWS SWEET F.A! To celebrate its signing of the Premier League licence, Ocean decided to take CVG's resident football pundits Paul Rand and Gary Whitta to Wembley to watch the vital World Cup qualifying clash between England and mighty San Marino. Here is their exclusive after-match verdict: WHITTA: Well Randy, it certainly was a game of two halves. RANDY: It certainly was, Gaz. It's a funny old game, but 90 minutes is 90 minutes, and it only takes a second to score a goal. WHITTA: That's right, Brian. San Marino must have been as sick as a parrot after the England lads done good. They'll be over the moon about that result. It was a real six-pointer. RANDY: Yes, Gazza, Dazza, Lazza, Cazza, Fazza, Pazza and the rest of Graham Taylor's Red White and Blue army will be proper chuffed. It takes me back to the days of Bobby Moore and that great 4-2 victory over West Germany right here in Wembley Stadium. WHITTA: Yes, it certainly brings a lump to the old throat. So, a good night for England and the English fans then, Randy? RANDY: Oh, definitely. They'll have nothing to complain about tonight. WHITTA: Expect perhaps that alleged tosspot, John Barnes. RANDY: Yeah, except him. The git. GE HINTERE 1 MEGA CD CLIFFHANGER! As the 1993 football season enters its latter stages and the tension reaches almost intolerable levels as the top clubs battle it out for the League title, what better time for a software company to step in and grab some of the action by snapping up the official FA Premier League licence? No better time, that's what! Hardly surprising, then, that Ocean has done just that. FA Premier League Football is promising to claim the soccer sim crown from the likes of 2Sensible Soccer and the Kick Off series when it's released on Amiga and PC next month. The project was originally developed by Audiogenic under the name of World Class Soccer, but was picked up by Ocean earlier this year and has since been modified to fit the Premier League tie-in. The game is strictly an actionbased affair, with no boring management malarkey to muck things up and an innovative dual-view display system that allows you to to play from either a sideon perspective or a birds-eye view as in Kick Off! And of course, with the official licence and everything, all the authentic Premier League teams, players and kits are in there too come on you Spurs! Those of you who prefer to watch football on TV rather than live can also have a ball by playing with the video-style action replay facilities. Although it's an action-only game, Ocean is currently working on a separate management game (also bearing the Premier League monicker) to be released later in the year that users will be able to interface with the first game to create a full «play and manage\" experience. Stuffy types can just play the management game on its own if they really want to. Further details are scarce right now, but with little competition to face on the PC, Ocean's effort could well make it to the top of the IBM Premier League. On Amiga, however, it faces much stiffer competition in the form of the awesome Sensible Soccer and Virgin's forthcoming Goal!, not to mention the perennial classic, Kick Off 2. FA Premier League Football is due out on Amiga and PC next month, when we'll also have the full review. Of course. Sylvester Stallone's action-packed new movie, Cliffhanger, is the latest bigname film to be snapped up by Sony for Sega's Mega CD system. Due to hit UK cinemas before Summer, the film is also to be converted for Sega and Nintendo cartridge formats later in the year. In the film, mountain rescue expert Gabe Walker (played by Sly) has to venture into the perilous Rocky (sic) mountains to track down a bunch of hijackers who have crash landed there and taken his pals hostage. Interestingly, the lead baddy is played by \"Technique\" out of London's Burning, so it should be good for a laugh if nothing else. The basic idea of the game is to collect cash from the tricky mountain terrain and use it as ransom money to rescue your buddies. «When we read the screenplay for Cliffhanger, we immediately saw the potential this story had as a great video game,\" says a Sony spokesperson. No doubt the movie, with all its big-budget special effects, is ideal video game fodder, so we await its arrival with interest. Unfortunately it's not due out until the Autumn, so keep your hair on. UNGA BUNGA! OCEAN GETS MENACING Licence kings Ocean have snapped up another of 1993's big-name movies not content with already signing Steven Spielberg's dinosaur epic Jurassic Park, they've now picked up the rights to another potential Summer blockbuster. Yes, it's Dennis the Menace! No, not the tousle-haired tearaway from our beloved Beano comic, but the blonde (but equally troublesome) American version, who's known over here simply as Dennis to avoid any confusion. Early risers might have caught Dennis' animated exploits on The Big Breakfast of late, although it's the not the cartoon that Ocean will be basing the game on, but the live-action movie spin-off from John \"Home Alone\" Hughes, which is said to be Warner Bros' big box-office hope this year. The plot has the meddlesome Dennis kidnapped by... well, kidnappers before foiling their plans in a variety of ways that even Macaulay Culkin would be proud of. After experimenting with a Double Dragon-style beat'em-up, Ocean's in-house program ming team has reverted to the more familiar platform genre for this title, although we're assured that it won't be just another Mario clone. Although it's still very early in develop ment, it's already showing a lot of promise it's due to arrive on SNES, NES, Gameboy and Amiga this Summer, to coincide with the movie's release. Oh, and before we forget, work has recently started up at Ocean's programming haven on Lobo, the video game adaptation of the ultra-violent comic from the creators of Judge Dredd. It's already being hyped as one of the most violent games ever, and is due for release on Nintendo and Amiga formats at the end of the year. Yum yum... Data East has two new titles slated for release on Super Nintendo soon, the first of which is the latest in a long line of platform carts set in prehistoric times. Following on from the likes of PC Kid, Joe & Mac and, as featured on page 56-57, Chuck Rock, Congo's Caper is yet another bout of Neanderthal merriment. This time though, it features Congo, a lovable caveboy out to rescue his beloved Congette. It's a 35level romp that looks, for the most part, fairly predictable from what we've seen so far, although Data East promises that it's \"not just another jump-and-hit game\". Special attack and movement techniques are the order of the day here, and there's even a fruit machine bonus level for slot addicts. Slightly less information is available on Shadowrun, a futuristic Cyberpunk-type affair based on the popular comic. It's an isometric 3D arcade adventure with a sprinkling of strategy, in which the object is to download the top-secret data burned into your brain before the bad guys can get to it. Both Congo's Caper and Shadowrun should be available on import at least) within the next couple of months. There's no official UK release date as yet. GVG 008 "


"YOU'RE TERMINATED AGAIN! 3D-OH! It's been nine years since Terminator fever first swept the nation with the release of the original film, and it's still going strong. We've already been treated to versions of both movies on Sega formats, and now The Terminator is back (just like he promised) yet again, this time on Super Nintendo! While SNES owners wait patiently for a version of T2 for their machine, they'll no doubt be more than happy to make do with this adaptation of the first movie, which comes courtesy of Mind scape. Similar in style to Virgin's Megadrive version, Terminator on the SNES is a multi-level arcade extravaganza set in Los Angeles. The game opens first in the war-torn city of 2029, then returns to 1984 with the player taking on the might of Arnie across a series of platform based shoot 'em up stages. There are also two Out Run-style driving scenes to get to grips with, again with the unstoppable Arnie in hot pursuit all the way. Due for release sometime in May. The Terminator has already been the source of much spare time amusement for the CVG boys, and there's a full review next month in the new-look mag. As Shaw Taylor says, \"Keep 'em peeled\". Well, here it is! The video entertainment system that's going to change the way you play games forever and have an impact on every aspect of your life! Probably. Unveiled for the first time at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the spanking new 3DO system is the long-awaited fruit of the new company (also called 3D0) set up by Electronic Arts' visionary founder Trip Hawkins. We've all heard a lot of hot air and hype about how the 3D0 wondermachine is going to change life on Earth as we know it, but does the (almost) finished article live up to expectations? The truth is nobody knows because, although the wraps may have been taken off 3D0 officially, the system is still shrouded in James Bond-like secrecy. The facts as they stand are these: it's a CD-based 32-bit console (which means it's twice as hard as the Megadrive and has four times as many bits as the SNES) using a state-of-the-art RISC processor and with custom graphics and processing power that promises to knock the socks off any home system currently available. Reckon your top-of-the-range 486SX PC packs a punch? Pah! 3D0 takes a 486PC, chops it up with a big axe and flushes the bits down the toilet! That's how hard it is. New CD formats and games consoles have come and gone over the years regardless of their impressive specifications, but 3D0 seems to have a little more behind it than technical muscle to ensure its success. Some of the biggest companies in the world are backing the new machine, including communication giants AT&T and Panasonic, Warner Bros and MCA Universal, who are already planning an \"interactive movie\" version of Jurassic Park, which promises to be one of the first titles for the new system. The system is still waiting to be released in the US, but is expected to appear this autumn with a price tag of around $800 (). A British release date still has not been set, but don't hold your breath it's not likely to appear until well into 1994. Of course, if you've got the cash you could buy an imported machine and SAMPLE maybe even some software by the end of the year. As usual, CVG will have the first proper look at the new machine and handing the details onto you. NEW BUNDLE OF JOY poole 000? Throw away your old joypad! It's just not good enough! That, at least, is the message being trumpeted loud and clear by Dragon about their splendiferous new family of game controllers. Known as the Dragon Turbo Il Joypad, this latest addition to the ever-burgeoning world of console accessories reckons it's just that bit harder than the rest, Like what exactly? Well, how about LED indicators that flash when you press one of the fire buttons (gasp!)? Or a super-fast, two-speed Turbo button that fires twice as rapidly as any other pad? A slow-motion button? Phew, that should be enough for you and to cap it all, you've got hardly any chance of copping a duff' un, as Dragon assure us that their \"high quality manufacturing\" methods mean that the fault rate is less than & BO I JOY 1%. Wowee! Both the Sega Megadrive and Super Nintendo versions of the Turbo Il should be available in the shops by the time you read this, at .99 and .99 respectively. And, just in case any old fogeys (like Garth) out there are wondering, no this isn't the same Dragon that produced those lovely, but long since extinct, 8-bit computers back in the early eighties, although the logo is the same. Funny old world, innit? DED SPEED IN 0000 009 cVG "


"NEWS STORIES SPORTS DOUBLE HEADER TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE JOHN MADDEN Are you one of the sad sacks who still hasn't got around to buying a Megadrive yet? If so, there's never been a better time to finally take the plunge and snap them up, thanks to a new deal arranged by Electronic Arts and Sega. The software and hardware giants have put their heads together to come up with a new Megadrive bundle featuring Double Header a special \"two-in-one\" cartridge featuring John Madden Football and EA Hockey, two of EA's most successful Sega titles ever. Although both of the games featured in the pack have since been sequelled (with NHLPA Hockey and John Madden 92 AND 93), Double Header is an opportunity to sample a pair of sporting classics in their original incarnations. Well, at least it makes a change from Sonic the Hedgehog. The EA Sports Double Header pack should be in the shops by the time you read this and is going for a song at .99. Oh, and in case you're thinking about buying Double Header separately, forget it. It's been produced exclusively for the Sega pack and won't be available for sale on its own. So there. BOB'S BIG NIGHT OUT NO ORDINARY JOE Electronic Arts is well known for some sterling original titles on Megadrive and computer formats but its first home-grown product is about to hit the SNES. Called The Adventures of the Bob, you take on the persona of a rocket-powered Romeo whose space ship has crashed on the way to a date with his Venus of the stars and he must fight his way past a multitude of puzzles and angry planet residents before he can get to see his beloved. With six types of weapon and another half a dozen various gadgets with which to overcome the perils of his off-world pit stop, spread over three worlds, Bob's going to have his work cut out. Bob will be available on SNES in May priced .99 and the Megadrive version should follow in July. Hudson Soft, previously best known for its sterling work on the PC Engine (including Gunhed, PC Kid and Bomberman), has an original title on the way for Amiga, PC and SNES. Having already converted both PC Kid and Bomberman to the 16-bit computers (they appeared as BC Kid and Dynablaster respectively), the company now has Yo!Joel, a platform-style romp in the traditional style on the way. With an arcade pedigree to be proud of, Hudson is expected to come up with something a bit special with Yo!Joel, even if the platform genre is already standing room only at the moment the ability to bash the baddies on the bonce with a variety of makeshift weapons should prove a laugh at least. The Amiga and PC versions are due out this Spring, with the SNES format debuting no earlier than 1994. More news soon. cvG 010 "

"CVC CUE REVIEW SNES CHIPS WITH EVERYTHING VENOM ARCADE BY NINTENDO .99 TITANIR ASTEROID So how on earth does the Super Nintendo create such a stunning three-dimensional universe when it's widely known that the machine is simply not capable of running fast polygons? It's all down to the fabled, and much vaunted, SFX chip! Created by 3D specialist Jez San, whose company Argonaut Software produced the ground-breaking polygon blasters Starglider I and II and the not-desperately good flight sim Birds of Prey, the SFX allows for mega-speedy manipulation of those shapes we know and love. As you can imagine, neither Mr San nor Nintendo are giving the game away on how the chip works, or when the next cart to utilise SFX will be released. But as soon as we know, so will you! TOETU SECTOR Z COPNEPA STEEDS Go on, try the hard level if you dare! D loody Venom Empire. The Dwhole galaxy knows it's got the most destructive fleet of space cruisers in the cosmos, and nobody in their right mind is going to take it on. But Venom decides to make its way toward the lowly little planet of Corneria to kick seven kinds of faecal material out of it. However, Corneria has its own form of defence. The Arwing is THE most incredible craft ever, and the only four in existence are piloted by the four most competent flyers on Corneria. Led by Fox McCloud, the quartet haven't got time to waste; they've got to get out there and do some serious damage, before Venom does likewise. An unlikely team of heroes! FROM A TO B AIN'T A CUP OF TEA Everything you may have heard about this game is true Star Fox IS the most incredible piece of software you've ever seen on the Super Nintendo! Yes, even better than Streetfighter II! The SFX chip gives the SNES the power to turn in a polygon-based epic that an arcade machine would have a hard time competing with. The game itself is a blast, full of all those features people have been gagging for in a game such as this for eons, such as interaction with other characters, battlecruiser strafing Star Wars-style and other such delights! Star Fox's soundtracks are perfectly suited to the game, being slow and moody when building up to the start of a level, and action-packed and racy once you're in the thick of it. It may cost sixty-five quid, but Star Fox is worth it; you couldn't want for anything_more than what it offers. PAUL RAND CVG 014 Getting to Venom isn't as easy as jumping onto a number 73 space shuttle and handing over enough credits to cover zones one to four. The player can choose from three different routes, each one more treacherous than the last. Fight your way through cityscapes, massive meteorite storms, the innards of hulking great spaceships and even the surface of a huge meteor, while at the same time tackling the untold amounts of enemy craft which won't let up until you've completed your mission! This isn't the time to play Follow My Leader! That's too close for comfort! "


"REVIEW GVG FOX-FIGHTING The training mode has you flying through rings to perfect your skills. Obviously, the key to survival in Star Fox is the simple matter of 'kill them before they kill you'. Or is it? Not when you've got to blaze a trail through the many maze-like structures that have been positioned between yourself and victory! As well as enormous buildings which, without any thought for possible air-to-air dogfighting, have been constructed with barely the space of a single hair between them, there are also swarms of space rock to negotiate and, on the more difficult routes, gigantic yet unexplainable constructions, simply hovering in the vastness of the galaxy. There's also those annoying baddies to take on too, but luckily the majority of these can be taken out with a single blast of your high-powered photon cannons. Blast the 'bots but dodge the pillar when it falls. HIT START TO GO BACK TO THE GAME, RIBBIT!! SHIELD THEY'RE BAD! Very swish! Venom's forces are many and varied, based on land, in the air and, of course, in space. From helicopterlike craft and futuristic battle-tanks to monolithic, Star Wars ST-AT Walker-like constructions, to highly manoeuvrable space fighters and heavily armed military satellites. Most of these enemies can be turned into atoms with one well-placed shot, but all the time they're blasting hell out of you and your buddies, so don't forget to keep a watchful eye on the screen for incoming blasts. Let's rock! CORNERIA THE BASE The puff of smoke indicates that you're not very good and are about to crash. STOR FOX TEAM, OUR LAST RESORT IS TO COUNTER ATTACK VENOM GOOD LUCK You'll need it! CONTROL YOUR DESTINY To assist those players new to 3D space battling, there are a number of control options to suit most gamers. And guess what?

"AVC CVE REVIEW Who he? HIGH ENERGY Travelling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, kid! Getting hit by enemy fire or, if you're like sad Paul Anglin, flying into Venom spaceships puts a strain on the hull of your craft, so much so that you'll lose energy each time you come into direct contact with a nasty. Get hit too many times and you'll crash and burn, losing one of your three lives in the process and with only one continue to rely upon, you could be looking well sick if you're a bit of an unfortunate case when it comes to alien fleet destruction. Luckily though, there are, scattered throughout the cosmos, energy recharge points. SHIELD SMALL ENERGY: Shoot through the middle to add a little extra power to your shields. He big! BIG ENERGY: Fly through these babies and you'll receive up to half your maximum quota of shield power. Okay, there's no need to show off. SHIELD He quite hard, too! Crumbs! BIG BOSS MEN The rock crusher not exactly built for battle. Thought you'd seen it all when it comes to end-level guardians? Think again! The big bosses in Star Fox are some of the biggest, most graphically amazing and most deadly you'll ever come across in video game land! Armed to the teeth, the majority of them have a number of weakspots which you must blast at to strip away the layers of armour before you get a crack at the dangerous enemy inside and if you've got him that angry, you can imagine the amount of firepower he's going to hurl your way before he finally gives in, allowing you to continue to the next, more dangerous stage. This is the space shoot 'em up everyone's    dying to play! The super-fast polygons are absolutely stunning, and the ship moves with such realism that you'll flinch in your seat whenever you collide with an object or scrape your wings on the side of an obstacle and watch bits fly off your ship! You're never alone in Star Fox, and your band of trusty star pilots will call out to you across space, appealing for help in blasting bogeys off their tails. You can see smaller craft just as well as the huge star cruisers thanks to the SFX chip and its wondrous graphic handling capabilities, and there's none of that 'blink and you'll miss it' rubbish that plagues most intricate first-person perspective blasters. Another triumph for Nintendo over its competitors Star Fox is a cart you can't do without! What's that in the distance? Can't make it out for sure... Mummy! Mummy!! feel airsick! STEVE KEEN Blimey!

"REVIEW CVE CVC HERE'S THE BOYS! Slippy: Not only does he hate the one about the wide mouthed frog (for obvious reasons) he also tends to get into the most bother out of the three. Mind you, he's also the one who'll give you most help. SO Peppy: The wise old veteran of the group, Peppy looks down at the current crop of young flyboys. He'll keep out of the action as often as he can, which is probably why he's been around for so long. Fox McCloud isn't the only pilot out there fighting for truth, justice and the interplanetary way! Our hero has dragged a trio of top pilots along for the ride, each of whom has his own characteristics. Rest assured that, if you get into difficulty, the boys will do their damndest to save your skin, but they'll expect similar assistance from you! The pilots are: Falco: When it comes to gung-ho dogfighting, only McCloud can match the dazzling skills of Falco, the pilot currently regarded as the finest in the galaxy. Don't bank on Falco constantly coming to your assistance, though he has a worrying tendency to do his own thing. FLASH! AH-AHHH! It may look quiet now... Star Fox is the BUSINESS, with graphics a mazingly excellent that they wouldn't look out of place in an arcade. Have you seen Namco's amazing coin-op, Starblade? This is almost as good, no kidding. An incredible amount of varied shoot'em up action has been packed into the cart, so much so that I'd say this is the best arcade game currently available on SNES if not the best game full stop. And it's going to take some beating! It's not often that I enthuse this much over a game, but Star Fox really does deserve it. Did I mention the incredible atmosphere generated by the awesome pounding music and sound effects? No? Oh, I'd better do that as well then. What else can I say? Brilliant brilliant brilliant times infinity. If you don't have to buy a new pair of trousers after playing this game, I'll eat mine. GARTH SUMPTER Along with your laser cannon (which can be powered up to twice its normal capacity), your Arwing fighter is armed with devastating Flash Bombs, which not only flash (although they perform that action very well), but also destroy most enemies within its radius. There isn't an unlimited supply of bombs, however; you begin the game with three and, if you're very lucky, may be able to get your hands on one or two more throughout your travels. Blast at the pylons for big points! SHIELE STRATEGY SKILL But things tend to get hairy atop the meteor! CONVERTER CONUNDRUM STAGE-I CLEAR Because the Star Fox cart is constructed differently to a normal SNES game, thanks to the all-new SFX chip, your bog-standard converter isn't going to let you play the game. Check with your local supplier for a converter which works.

Flaming swords that shoot balls of fire, blue lightning bolts and other such spooky specials as Super Jump and Teleportation are all hidden within the vial's contents. Meet the dreaded Octopi of Death! It's hard to categorise Chakan. On the one hand it can be incredibly frustrating to play. On the other it's a delight as you get drawn deeper into the darkest realms of Chakan's world. Some of the graphical effects are brilliant, especially when our man disappears into a teleportation hole in a cloud of pixels. The biggest disappointment is the absence of any logical game progression. You can walk aimlessly NOT around any number of locations without a clue where to go to next.

"cue 3 PAGE REVIEW MEGA CD ARCADE Meet your co-pilot. BY SEGA - WHAT'S THE CHARGE? Commissioner Stenchler, sitting all the way up there in Solar City, has assigned you to Sewer cleaning duties and paired you with the most obnoxious co-pilot ever Ghost! All his previous pilots have a history of early retirement. Now it's your turn. The sewers are getting more and more overrun with every passing moment, and the people in Solar City are getting worried. There have been reports of strange things going in the sewers lately. Ghost's buddy, Falco is reported to have been last seen around the notorious sector 19. Luckily, your Sewer Shark is no ordinary machine, having been heavily customised by the manic Ghost, making it almost as deadly as your partner. Time to jump the tubes, boy there's work to be done! Listen up DogMeat. With the sewers so full of nasties of all shapes and descriptions, you can expect your Sewer Shark to take a bit of a battering. There are no energy pick-ups anywhere in the sewers. The only way to power up your Sewer Shark is by using the recharge stations that are scattered around the Labyrinth of tubes. When a recharge station is approaching, Ghost will tell you to look out for it. Just before you reach it, two Active Charge lights at the top of the tunnel will indicate which tube is active for recharge purposes (red signals mean inactive and green signals are active). If you go down the red tube you won't crash, it just means that the Sewer Shark won't recharge. One of the many Ratigators. TURN AND BURN Although Catfish will give you directions, you will have to make the turns to get the Sewer Shark on the right track. Once you have been given your co-ordinates, the Shark will shoot down the myriad of tunnels at breakneck speed so it's important to remember the directions. The maze of tunnels also comes complete with huge doors that Catfish will open for you, but once you're off target you can't be sure that you won't crunch into one. If you do, at the speed that you're travelling the last thing that'll go through your mind is your ass. All these tubes will appear on your Tube Jump Indicator, but you should only take the ones that you have been instructed to follow. Before you can turn your Sewer Shark you have to engage the steering controls. This is achieved by pressing B and pushing the joypad in whichever direction you wish to turn It's apparent that Sega has put so much effort into making the full-motion video in Sewer Shark look the biz, it's left no space for anything else. Sewer Shark resembles that other reasonably sad effort, Thunderstorm FX. All you do is move the cursor left and right to shoot the Ratigators that look more like brown blobs. That's another thing the graphics are supposed to be incredible, but they just look so Could do better! dodgy and fragmented that you can often get really annoyed with them. The live action scenes, as excellent as they may be, go no way to saving a game that is already a seriously long way down Skid Row. At the end of the day, Sewer Shark is not! the miracle we were hoping for. In fact, it's not even the decent Mega CD game we were hoping for. This one's best left to the sewers until programmers realise just what this machine can do. PAUL ANGLIN You nalled the Ratigator but the Bat is still there. OGMAT GVG 020 "

There are far too many intersecting tunnels and tubes down in the sewers for Ghost to be able to keep track of. So you have a second pair of eyes and ears, in the form of Catfish. The drone flies in front of you and gives you jump data which lets you know which tunnels to take. Your co-ordinates are given using clockface positions; twelve (up), three (right), six (down) and nine (left). And the poor thing gets no time for R'n' R Catfish is also responsible for opening all the sewer gates to allow you through. If you go off course, Catfish will try to get you back on track if he can! It's that fat get Stenchler again. The Sewer Shark means business. VG021 "


"GVG aus 3 PAGE REVIEW CUT! AND ACTION! DOGA 1 Catfish will give you your co-ordinates via Ghost. The direc. tions will appear on the directional indicator so if you don't hear them you can see them as they light in sequence... One of the major selling points of Sewer Shark is the inclusion of loads of cut scenes featuring-full motion video sequences. These pop up very frequently in Sewer Shark to tell you the storyline and inform you of your progress (although the best of the lot is definitely the intro). The various characters all have different per sonalities and you'll have to learn who you can and can't trust before you make it to Solar City Commissioner Stenchler shouldn't be trusted any further than he can be thrown (and he's a fat get so you can't throw him very far at all). But Catfish and Falco provide vital information that you'll need to make it to the scared place. Good luck and choose wisely. Don't pay too much attention to sad Anglin. He's just upset because he can't get past level two and make it all the way to Solar City like the rest of us! Sewer Shark's graphics will blow the nappies off all Mega CD virgins and the speech alone will keep you playing until the end. There really isn't much to the gameplay, but just what do you expect to be able to do with existing CD technology control an entire film? Sewer Shark is hardly original, but stunning to look at and above all, pretty good fun to play. The acting from the characters is fairly plausible, which is perfect for this type of adventure; the constant goading and encouragement dished out by your co-pilot really adds to the excitement of it all. Is it worth the money? Well I doubt it, but it's one of the the better games available at the moment on CD and I think you'll have to wait some time before a more in-depth CD blaster turns up. Remember, Operation Wolf was little more that a point and shoot game without the benefit of Full Motion Video and that was huge! A game that'll certainly impress your friends. 2 Your indicator shows you when there is a turn coming up. He's in your sights, now blast him. PAUL RAND STRATEGY SKILL 16.43 3 Once you see that a turn is coming up that'll keep you on course then you must turn by pressing the joypad in the requisite direction and then press the B button. The perfect pair get out for a bit of sunshine in Solar City. ACTION REFLEXES 4 Turn successful. Hurrah! Falco's in trouble. % 95 GETTING RATTY GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE 48 CVG These sewers are absolutely crawling with mutations of all kinds. Bats are the most common and are very difficult to kill as they are fast and furious. Fortunately they cause you no harm if you miss them. Ratigators are just what you would imagine a mutation of a sewer rat and an Alligator. These are slightly easier to hit, and again they will cause you no harm if you miss them. The Scorpions are really nasty. They will attack the Hole Hawg on sight and if you don't kill them, they hang on to the side of the Sewer Shark draining your energy. Moles were originally used by the department to clean the sewers but now they've been reprogrammed by Stenchler to attack you. They attack all Sewer Sharks and, with their fearsome array, of weapons, you'd better be on your toes. Zerks are the most dangerous of all sewer inhabitants. They feed on the hydrogen and power from the recharge stations. Contacts with Zerks usually result in a nice Cranial Lobotomy! Recently there have been reports of a \"Crazy Looking Thing\" deep in the sewers. There's been no contact with it yet, but all the signs are that it could be friendly.

"HVB PC EN OANGLri ne Christmas Day many years ago, young PAUL ANGLIN found a PC Engine nestling in his Christmas stocking. Since then, the lad has been a devoted Engineer and, with loads of new machines on the horizon and CD drives here, there and everywhere, the CVG tyke takes a look at the one that got left behind and finds out just what it has to offer. THE ONE TI HOUSE BUNNY EYES The original PC Engine was first released in Japan around August of '88. At the time it was one of the most widely supported machines around, even though it was by far technically inferior to it's biggest rival, the Megadrive. The PC Engine has come a long way since then, with a massive amount of software support but unfortunately, only in Japan and the US. The PC Engine has often been referred to as THE machine for shoot 'em ups, and with flawless copies of such titles as RType, Side Arms, Nemesis, Salamander, Twin Cobra and loads of others, you can hardly argue. Way back in August '88, the PC Engine arrived on the home entertainment scene. Although only an eightbit machine this five-inch white wonder took the console market by storm, making the already incredibly popular Megadrive look a little uneasy on its lofty perch. The little machine went on to sell bucketloads and was destined for stardom in Japan anyway! Shortly afterwards, the PC Engine was released in America and, although it had a large impact on the market, it didn't go on to anything like the success of its Far Eastern counterpart. This was mainly attributed to the fact that Nintendo's NES already had far too firm a foothold in the market to be even nudged out of place. By late 1990, the PC Engine had become quite a popular piece of kit in the UK. Although available only through importers (for a grand price of !) the machine made a regular appearance in CVG's console section, which was then entitled Mean Machines (ring any bells?) The PC Engine was giving the Megadrive some serious stick for a number of reasons. Firstly, there was a stack more games out for the Engine with plenty of software houses developing games for the machine, and many others literally falling over themselves trying to get a developer's licence on both sides of the Pacific. By this time there was already a large amount of add-ons available for the Engine, including CD ROM. This was the first piece of CD games technology most of us Brits had seen, and it sent everyone absolutely completely gaga. Then something terrible happened the Megadrive was released officially in the UK and the Engine WASN'T! This was when things first started to go wrong for NEC's little wonder. The Megadrive was already in High Street shops and selling like hotcakes, despite it's rather hefty price tag of .99! Then came the news that we had all been waiting for — the PC Engine WOULD be officially released. We all got very excited, everyone's palms got very sweaty and then suddenly, for no given reason NEC decided against the idea. What followed was countless release dates that always came to nothing, and ultimately all us Brits are still sitting here HVG 024 Engineless. Gumph! Graphics: 16 colours on-screen from a palette of 512. The machine can handle up to 64 sprites simultaneously. Sound: The PC Engine has an excellent six-channel stereo sound chip from which the best results are achieved by hooking the machine up to an AV booster. Processor: At the heart of the machine is a custom 6502 LSI that runs at around 7.2 Mhz. Peripherals: Absolutely loads. Turbo joypads, AV Boosters, standard joysticks, five player multitaps, CD ROM, graphics pads, battery packed RAM (lets you save game positions) Karaoke and there's more. BAD TO THE CORE This is where things get a little complicated, so listen up. The PC Engine was developed by Hudson Soft but marketed by NEC. Then Hudson Soft decided to release their own version of the machine. The only difference is that theirs is black. Technically, they are exactly the same. "


"AVA GINE SHUTT IT! HURRAH! WHAT SUPER GRAFX Sega picked up on this idea with the Master System II changing the look of the machine as a gimmick to sell more units! The PC Engine Shuttle is again from Hudson Soft, and is technically the same as the previous two. Hurrah! the first real advancement well, sort of! The SG (Super Grafx) is a slightly upgraded version of the original machine, which originally appeared in Japan in late '89. The Super Grafix failed to take off due to it being far too similar to the original. True, there was a slightly upgraded processor in there and more fancy things were possible, but software support just didn't materialise in a big way and the machine only barely made it to the States. The most attractive feature of the SG was the Power Console a huge joystick add-on, similar to the one on the Star Wars coin-op! Also attached to the Power Console was a yoke with topmounted buttons, a gear stick/throttle, LCD clock timer, LED radar display and a numeric keyboard! Even with all these extra features, it unfortunenately never saw the light of day. COME AND SIT ON MY LAP Processor: 6502 LSI + Colours: 512 Resolution: 256x216 Sprites: 128 on-screen simultaneously. Sound: Six channel stereo. RAM: 128k with 32k video RAM. Peripherals: The Power Console. ENGINES ON THE MOVIE GT TIPS? This is probably the swankiest bit of kit yet! It's basically a PC Engine with a flip-top lid, and built into that lid is a little monitor five inches square, which provides perfect portable use almost. The problem is that the machine only takes a power supply and not batteries, so unless you've got one helluva long lead you can only use it in the home. It's not cheap the LT will set you back around ! and technically it's no different to the standard version. When it was on the drawing board the PC Engine GT was fighting it out with Sega's still under-construction hand-held, the Microdrive (this was later to become the Game Gear). But when it finally emerged it blew the pants off everything available. The GT had the instant advantage of being compatible with every available PC Engine cartridge. The machine measures 180mm x 100mm x 45mm and has a colour LCD screen three inches square. Technically, the GT IS a PC Engine squeezed into a smaller box. It has all the features you would expect from a hand-held, ComLink; a port for headphones and a TV Tuner. Unfortunately, because the only versions of the machine are American and Japanese you'll only be able to use the latter in those countries! The battery life is a rather sad three hours, but the GT has a mains port. It's available from most importers costing anything from  to ! CVG 025 "


"HE GUG FEAR COMPACT ENGINES THE GAMES THE CARD SOFTWARE There are far too many games to list here, but here's five of the all-time greats. Gunhed. Quite possibly the finest blaster ever. Fly through horizontallyscrolling space levels, laying waste to everything. Unparalleled gameplay and some of the clearest speech you'll ever hear. 94% TWO BY TWO The latest advancement in PC Engine-based CD technology is the Turbo Duo. Housed in a stylish charcoal case with black buttons and slick lines, lurking beneath the Duo's lid are a PC Engine and CD drive, but what makes the machine so special is its CD ROM2 disc management system (there's no external system card that's been built into the machine), which allows some of the fastest disc access times yet seen. Unlike other machines which make you wait ages while the next segment of data loads, the Duo offers virtually instant play from any section of the disc, and of course in true Engine style all existing card and CD games are totally compatible with the machine. More CD titles are currently being developed using the machine's new advantages. The Duo is available from most mail order companies at the grand price of  but think about it; for that you get a PC Engine, a CD ROM, a brand new system card AND  of software! PC Kid Every console has it's hero and PC Kid is the Engine's. Guide the slap head Kid around prehistoric landscapes nutting dinosaurs to rescue your fair princess. One of the best and most original platformers to date. 93% 2013 Seo Xiene SC NIG25100 Dungeon Explorer Up to five play ers can take part in this Gauntlet-esque adventure. Dungeon Explorer mixes arcade adventure with some truly original puzzle ideas. Excellent! 92% The most impressive feature of the PC Engine is its superb CD capabilities. Released about one year after the Engine, the CD ROM drive bolted onto the side of the machine via an interface unit. The drive was built with expansion in mind; insert a system card into the PC Engine and that drives the CD. This way, the machine is simple to upgrade it's just a case of making a new system card for it. This advantage was exploited to it's full numerous times by NEC, to bring the CD ROM kicking and screaming into the realms of current CD technology. THE TWO ROMS Soldier Blade Another superb Hudson Soft shooter. Gameplay is very much in the Gunhed mould with a few new touches and even harder gameplay. 94% FYTOG Devil Crash This is THE pinball sim Devil Crash combines excellent graphics with superb sound and truly stunning gameplay, to deliver one of the most realistic pinball sims ever created. 94% cVG 026 "


"CD SOFTWARE The CD games library is huge and getting bigger. Here's five of the better titles. SUMMARY Www R-Type Complete CD All eight levels of Irem's classic blast recreated perfectly onto CD. The gameplay has been left alone, but the music has been dramatically improved with stunning cartoon intros and cut scenes inbetween levels. 94% Well there you have it, the complete PC Engine family tree. The machine has become a real liv. ing legend in Japan and the US, and with a vast sea of add-ons and tons of superb games, the Engine is definitely the gamer's choice. So it's a little annoying that we've been denied that choice by NEC's rather strange marketing strategies, but who are we to question we're only the gamesplayers! There's still stacks of stuff constantly appearing on the PC Engine (PC Kid 3 and Dungeon Explorer II spring instantly to mind) and with the Mega CD almost upon us NEC may be inspired to unleash the Turbo Duo on us Brits. We can only hope. Index to Thesis Times THE FUTURE Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective Now this is what CD games are all about. The game features loads of digitised live action with sampled speech, and three tough cases to solve as the Baker Street-based detective. 93% FRIDAY, APRIL 11, 1890 WEDNESDAY TUESDAY 3 THANKS... to Advanced Console Entertainment (071 439 1185) for the loan of the games used in this feature. he Tin Soldier Prince Of Persia The classic platform game comes to the CD in true style. Prince of Persia boasts excellent animation with immensely addictive and incredibly hard gameplay. 93% As far as the standard PC Engine is concerned, I think NEC have missed the boat. But if they were to release the Turbo Duo and the GT on these shores I think we could see a real battle ensue between NEC, Sega and Nintendo. Especially when you consider that PC Engine games are generally a damn sight cheaper than those for the SNES or Megadrive. There's been talk of one major advancement in the PC Engine world, but that one is enough to count for several. The next machine currently being developed by Hudson Soft is a staggeringly powerful 32-bit PC Engine! Very little is known about this machine at the moment; the only indication of its capabilities I can give you is this: have a look at the excellence of Star Fox on the SNES, achieved by a lot of very hard programming and the capabilities of the SNES' new SFX chip. Star Fox will sell for around  because of the added chip. The 32-bit PC Engine will be able to do all the fancy things that Starfox can as standard! This not only means that the machine is more powerful and there's more room for similar upgrades, but it also means that games will be cheaper. Hudson Soft is rumoured to have said that, if all goes well, it should be able to sell games at  a shout! And that could spark off one hell of a battle between the big boys. There's no rumour of price or even a possible date for the machine yet, but the signs are that it'll be worth the wait. Make sure you're there we will be! @ Curses Riot City The first CD based beat 'em up is very much in the style of Capcom's classic Final Fight. Riot City features excellent graphics with the exact essence of gameplay that made Final Fight such a hit. Get it now! 94% 32650 Loom LucasArts' first CD ROM adventure is an absolute classic. Guide Bobbin Threadbare around Loom Island and discover the mystery of the Elders. 95% THANKS... to Console Concepts (0782 712759) for the loan of the Turbo Due used in this feature. thorns 027 CVG "

"QUE REVIEW 292 2930 FS-6 SNES CHESTER HEEA PLATFORM TOO COOL TO Solar CHESTER'S CHALLENGE BY KANEKO .99 Come here and I'll box your ears. Yeah, you've gotta find the rad bike bits, but that's only half the problem! Every level takes place in a section of the zoo and is peppered with the kind of hazards that turn your hair white and your teeth black! Chester slinks off across the park and underground using the sewers in the first level and moves further afield to the monkey pits, hidden caves and through the 'gator valley. Huge, springing snakes get under your feet, but you can jump on their heads and be catapulted up to reach bonus tokens and extra lives. Tortoises on roller skates career into you and alligators snap at your heels. Pick off the paws and fruit to get you further through the park. 2900 L 120 W Mean Eugene the fun machine (not). hester Cheetah's the righteous kitty from the heart of the city, except this town's not too hip to the cat's ideas. Instead of living in a fully functioning penthouse pussy parlour, the poor feline's banged up in Four Corners Zoo. To make matters worse, the bogus zoo keeper Eugene has nabbed Chester's wheels, ripped his scooter to bits and hidden the parts around the enclosure. Mean Eugene's chosen the hiding places well, so you'll have to search high and low to rebuild the bike and make your escape. Chester's cool but the keeper's real mean, so he'll need just a little bit of help from his animal friends in order to make his great escape! Don't flip out on me man! Your monkey pal and a hungry helper. YOU NEED FRIENDS SK Spinning hedgehogs are the least worry. 5660 Li-80 Chester Cheetah tries its hardest to fool you into thinking it's a really a top-notch platform adventure. The bright colours and big sprites look awesome in still shots but their true pedigree comes to light when they move. They're really nothing more than badly drawn and poorly animated failures. Most levels are just so simple they'll only take minutes to comUNIVE plete and most of CRE the time you're reduced to jumping over objects and picking up a few bonuses. If you know someone extremely young, i.e. about three, they might get something out of it, but anyone older should keep away. STEVE KEEN Meet the gang of mates on 10O LIFE BOO who'll help Chester escape heinous Four Corners Zoo. m The Hip-o's a big-boned u dude with a heart to match. He'll carry you across rivers in Gator Alley. Funky Monkey has to be found before he can help you out.

"GVG REVIEW GVG MEGA-CD Oh dear your video's so bad, Boyd's gone to sleep! HANG THE VJ! CREATIVE BY SONY IMAGESOFT -40 Meet the totally awesome Boyd Packer, the superfly Video Jockey and host of Make My Video, the rap request show with a difference! Boyd is the real star of the proceedings, chatting to the loonies who phone in with their wacky requests and generally chilling out in his supercool studio all live on air. Boyd is as crazy as they come, with a strong line in rapid-fire banter and a knack for putting down any callers who don't reach his high standards of coolness. What a guy! VO!!! Get fresh dude, 'cos we're totally krossed out! Or something like that, anyway. Having topped the music charts on both sides of the Atlantic and even jammed with Michael Jackson, those back-to-front prepubescent popsters Mac Daddy and Daddy Mac (collectively known as Kris Kross) have now set their sights on conquering the video game world. They've had themselves digitised and can now be seen starring in one of the first titles to be released for Sega's spanking new Mega CD system! You're cast as the VT editor of Make My Video, America's only live call-in video request show. Spin those tracks and create those vids can you keep the viewers happy? MANE MY YOU'RE ON THE AIR! Dice Per To its credit, Make My Video makes excellent use of the new CD technology, with bags of fun live-action video footage, some of which is hugely entertaining to watch (Boyd is almost too cool to be true when he's on form). Unfortunately, the actual editing is simply too restrictive and simplistic to have any lasting appeal, and it's difficult to create anything truly unique or different because you have so little control over the editing process the main challenge is in creating something that the caller will like, and that's not too Lame! hard to do. Fun for about a day, the novelty soon wears thin and, after that, there's little incentive to return to it, especially since the three Kris Kross tracks become incredibly irritating once you've heard them a hundred times. An impressive demonstration of Mega CD's capabilities to be sure, but not much fun, I'm afraid. GARTH SUMPTER | 01:18:20 Make My Video's switchboard is always jammed with callers, desperate to get their fave track played on air. There are eight in all (they're always the same characters, SO don't get carried away), with their own personalities and musical tastes. After a brief pre-request chitchat with Boyd, the caller picks the Kris Kross track of his choice (selected from their three hits to date Jump, Warm It Up and I Missed The Bus), and then tells Boyd what kind of images and effects they want to see (and not see) in the accompanying promo film. Then it's Run VT and over to you! \"You're on the air!\" You have to live by your wits if your video's going to make it to the top of the charts. WON THE LAIR As Boyd Packer says: \"The payback's in the playback!\" Crank those SFX to the max. CVG 030 "


"REVIEW FUG THE SPLICE OF LIFE So how do you go about making your vid? Fortunately, it's not quite as tricky as learning the real craft of film editing. Here, in your super hightech mixing studio, you're presented with three TV monitors, each showing a selection of Kris Kross clips (mixed in with plenty of cool images culled from elsewhere), and you splice the final video together by simply switching between the three screens, using the A, B and C buttons, to feed the desired pics onto the master monitor. You have to work fast though, because you're editing live as the record is being played. The tracks range from around three to four minutes in length, so you'll have to keep coming up with new ideas if you want your vid to stay fresh. More editing frolics in the Mega CD online suite. Splice that Make My Video is a brilliant Id rather concept, but 7 Pick the choice a my nose. of group to exploit the medium is dire to the extreme. can barely bring myself to sit through Kris Kross' dirge when they appear on TV, without having to listen to them again and again whenever I want to play this game. There is some fun to be had as you create your crazy vid. The numerous special effects allow you to achieve results that wouldn't look out of place on MTV; whether they would further the artist's career is doubtful, but hey! The music industry's more about commercialism than talent anyway! There are more disks on the way, but if they're anything like this, only those with more money than sense need apply! STEVE KEEN TE: tape, bro! ror BITCHIN'! As well as splicing the raw clips together, as editor you can jazz them up with a variety of Top of the Pops-style special effects, including flips, strobes, colour washes, freeze frame, pixellation and other eye-blistering FX. Again, these are added as the record is played, and when the track is complete, Boyd plays back your finished masterpiece for the avid audience. Once that's over with, the original caller tells Boyd just what he thought of the video if it's a hit, you might just storm to the top of the charts. If he didn't like it (which is what happens if you forget to include the images and features the caller asked for), Boyd slaps you down and it's back to the drawing board.

"SEB TABLOID JUBBLIES >OURNO EREEN Dear YOB, CVG always raves on about how they get the first reviews of every game and how they put it in their mag first. But by the time we get it in Australia the games have been out a couple of weeks. Is there any way in solving that problem? I have a few questions: 1) What's your favourite console Megadrive or SNES? 2) Which has the better graphics? 3) What's the best action game on the Amiga? 4) Are Capcom bringing out a joystick for StreetAndrew Smith, Australia. fighter Il on the Amiga? SPANGLES Dear YOB, Although your magazine is brilliant we'd like to complain about the coverage of eight bit Amstrad computers. OK, so the Super NES and the Megadrive are pretty good machines but their games cannot be compared to Amstrad's 128 games. Now could you imagine comparing Mario 4 or Sonic to the likes of Chuckie Egg 2 and Manic Miner? I have to agree that Streetfighter II is quite a good game but surely the Amstrad 128k could beat it graphic wise? Here are some questions we would like answered: 1) Will Sonic 2 come out on the Amstrad 128k? 2) Do Amiga games fit inside the Amstrad 128k disk drive?. 3) When will Amstrad bring out a 16 bit hand held machine? Long live Amstrad and CVG. Ben, Steve and Vikas, Queensland, Australia. YOB: Just because you get the mag nine million years behind everyone else doesn't mean that we don't get the games first. You could try moving to somewhere less crap! Anyway, here're the answers to your particularly dull questions... 1) I've got both matey. 2) The SNES looks better but the Megadrive is faster. 3) Assassin. 4) I doubt it, seeing as Capcom had nothing to do with the Amiga version! YOB: You sad, sad men. You two have to be chin spinning. Surely there's no one that cretinously thick on this planet or is there? Let's just hope that neither of you evolve past amoeba stage or ever develop reproductive organs the world has enough problems without increasing the number of convicts populating it. PACERS DOUBLE AGENTS Dear YOB, After careful analysis of several of your more recent mailbags I (as a more than qualified psychologist) have come to the conclusion that you are in dire need of immediate Psychological aid. Due to some rather serious delusions you are becoming a dangerous threat to yourself and others' safety. Some of you activities (eg: assuming the identity of your older brother SNOB) point to the fact that you aim to hide a serious inability to perform vital interpersonal problems both physical and social. Events from early in your life have obviously been major contributions to your problems, so, to help release these anxieties, tell me about your parents. Are they large hairy baboons or were you just misshapen at birth? As a child were you denied your fundamental needs, such as a slow death by drowning. Or upon failure of this, a water and sawdust diet? Your feeble attempts at abuse will serve only to highlight an unhealthy denial of your own condition and/or showcase your severe inferiority complex. You need to learn methods other than written abuse to let go of your inner tensions. As part of your therapy you should practice smashing your face onto active orbital grinders. Glad to be of some help in your quest for sanity. Brian Langley, NT, Australia. Dear YOB, I am writing to ask for some advice. You see ever since I started reading your cool mag, I have wanted to be a YOB too. I have spiked my hair and got myself an earring. I walk everywhere wearing shades. Last week I walked into a shop to buy a really expensive pair of trainers (who do you think you are Anglin? YOB). The man in there thought he would try and insult me by calling me a YOB. I took this as quite a compliment. I need to know how I could be more like you so I can walk into more shops and be complimented. I hope you can help me! PS. The plaster on your forehead looks really cool and I'm going to buy some armlets. Matt Wilkinson, Camberley, Surrey. YOB: I think this is quite disgraceful behaviour for one of your age. Good lord when I was your age I never walked around the streets terrorising people. Oh no; when I was a lad I used to enjoy such pastimes as Bird Watching and stamp collecting. Bird Watching involved sellotaping bread crumbs to the window and watching our feathered friends nosediving into the window. I won't even go into the stamp collecting! YOB: What is it with you bloody Aussies this month? Will you all just get out of here and get on with cracking the tops off a few tinnies or throw a few shrimps on the Barbi this arbo (that's this afternoon for all us English). As for you being a qualified Psychologist, I doubt you're competent to even question the sanity of mad Jack McMad the outright winner of last year's Mr Mad competition! CVG 032 "


"TEXAN BAR SPACE DUST Dear YOB, I own a Super Nintendo and am proud of it. There is one thing I dislike. The Scart Super Nintendo on a Scart TV runs at 60hz which gives no border for arcade look and it's faster. The Pal Super Nintendo runs at 50hz which gives you heavy borders and makes it 17% slower. What Nintendo didn't know is some new pal TVs can take 60hz. So they should have put a 50hz/60hz switch on it but they didn't. I would like to know if Pal Super Nintendos can get a 60hz boost up. Dashmir Pacoroda, Doonside, Australia. Dear YOB, I'm writing in because I think your mag CVG is the best multi format mag out grovel, grovel, grovel. Also I hope you take the p**s out of my letter as I have a great sense of humour. What's green and spongy? A green sponge! Please, please help me in the game Lemmings for the PC. I am stuck on level 20 taxing. Please help me with this problem but if you don't know 'cos you are so thick that you wouldn't think a green sponge isn't green and spongy then don't bother. Bye. Chris Barbour, Worcestershire. YOB: Hmm. There's a few good points here but you're obviously not exactly Mr Electronics. If Nintendo had put a 50hz/60hz on the SNES it would have been considerably more expensive and would not be particularly reliable. However if you want to give your SNES a boost or do anything silly involving borders and 60hz then phone ACE Consoles (081 4391185). They'll be able to tell you everything you need to know about YOB: You certainly have a most pronounced sense of humour if you can get up every morning and carry on with your sad pathetic excuse for a life. I mean, level 20 of Lemmings! Is there any hope for you sad no life gets? RANCHEROS Dear YOB, Mr. Stoolhead here! Ear lobes are bigger than the month of June because Chicken Licking thought his chicken was being rode by a man with a matchstick, my arm seems longer on Tuesdays. Libba Libba! from the dreaded foot muncher. BAG YOB: Are you completely mad? The month of June is enormous! LUCKY BAGS Dear YOB As you are thick and stupid you may not be able to answer these questions but try your best. 1) Has the Game Boy got better games than the Game Gear? 2) Is the SNES better than the Neo Geo? 3) Why do Game Boy carts cost so much? 4) Is your mum proud of you? WHAM BAR Dear YOB, I have a few questions to tax your tiny (even minuscule) brain. Answer them or you will be sharmanated. 1) Will there be a CD Rom for the SNES? 2) If so will it be better than the Mega CD? 3) Are the SNES game good value as they cost around  ? 4) How much will the colour Game Boy cost? 5) is Prince of Persia on the SNES better than the Mega CD? 6) Did you know that the Dictionary description of the word YOB means an idle youth and a slob. A fitting description methinks. Steven \"the Sharmanater\" Sharwan, Suffolk. Robert Powell, Queensbridge, London. YOB: 1) Dunno mate. 2) Dunno mate. 3) Dunno mate. 4) Dunno mate I'm thick me. YOB: Well Steven, after consulting my book of name insults, I find that Steven actually stands for, 'Brainless git with no prospects, acne and. 1) Eventually you sad man. 2) We don't know until we see it you monkey's ass. 3) Depends how good it is you fop. 4) It's not available yet you sweat from a Baboon's armpit. 5) Yes you Take That CD buying saddie. 6) You just listed all my best features sad Suffolk farm boy. GOLDEN NUGGETS Dear YOB, I'm writing to complain about the review you did of Lemmings on the NES in issue 133. The floater was called a climber, the exploder was called a floater, the blocker was called an exploder and the builder was called a blocker. In your review of Road Runner it was a SNES review and there was a diagram of a Megadrive. I hope you get your reviews sorted out in the future. Now for a few quick questions: 1) Is there going to be a Streetfighter II joystick for the Megadrive? 2) Is the SNES better than the Megadrive? 3) Please could you settle an argument between my friend and me. Is the Amiga 500 better than than the Mega CD? 4) What computer do you have? PS. Give me  or die, sad case. lan Woodcock, Leighton, Buzzard. BANGY home YOB: So I write the reviews now do I? If you knew anything about CVG, you'd know that these types of mistakes can be due to a multitude of reasons but the single biggest reason is to give no-hopers like you something to talk about. Oh yes, and as you're such a despond, I'm not going to answer any of your questions. GVG 033 "


"AZTEC CRESTA Dear YOB, I am a girl and would very much like to meet you even if you do have a sarcasm problem. Anyway I am a proud Amiga owner and would really like to get my hands on a game of the past called Weird Dreams. I have been informed by my local computer shop that the publishers went bust and therefore the game is not being retailed anymore. Please could you tell me where I can get this game. Lots of me Debbie Mitchell, Manchester. PS. Are you married? THICK & STUPID Dear YOB, Oh dear! Have you come second with some hot news? | have read that there is now a new Streetfighter Il arcade game called wait for it Streetfighter II Turbo Champion Edition! All the characters have new and improved moves. For instance, Blanka's roll attack, Ken and Ryu and Ken's hurricane kick and Chun Li's Cyclone kick are now performed much higher in the air. Supposedly Ken and Ryu will now be able to do a head bash, Guile can perform Sonic Booms in mid air, Chun Li has fire balls and Dhalsim can teleport to the other side of the screen. Above all the game will run 20% faster. Is this true? Could you give me some information on the Teleport system for the Megadrive which is supposed to allow people to play against each other in different places. Please help me. Gareth Clark, Banbury, Oxon. PS. Your mag is wicked! SOMEBODY WHO WRITES INT SO THICK & STUPID YOB: A sarcasm problem me? Anyway your local computer shop is right, the people behind Weird Dreams have gone bust. The only way you're going to get a copy of the game is secondhand via the Microsells or something. And on the subject of mar. riage I refuse to talk about it, I'm busy, er.... I've got a headache, I'm emigrating this week...err.. YOB: It seems as though you've got your head firmly lodged up your ass! WE were the first ones to tell you about Streetfighter Il Turbo, and what you're talking about is Streetfighter Il Hyper Edition which includes all the features you just mentioned. Hal Your teleport news is almost as mixed up as you. Everyone knows that Megadrives can't transport except the intellectually underprivileged. B'S MA WEEKEND ZEGAZOIDS (A GREEN WHAM BAR?) Dear YOB, Whilst reading you superb 135th issue of CVG I noticed a small error on page 30 where you were reviewing Road Runner's Death Valley Rally for the Super Nintendo. Instead of a picture of a SNES there was a picture of a Megadrive which isn't on. In deep shock ! passed out and fell to the ground instantly chopping my head in half on a circular saw which laid behind me. Hours passed and arose from my unconscious state unaware of what had happened. I retrieved the top half of my scalp and crawled 260 miles to the Hospital where I received 2659 stitches which just happened to cost  as I went privately. So as it was your fault in the first place, I figure you should send me the  to pay the damages. Chris Sharp, Halifax, West Yorkshire. YOB: Well I personally think you should be sueing the Hospital. They could at least have given you some brains when they wasted their time repairing your head! Dear YOB, I would like to discuss a very important issue which I believe has not been delved into in very much detail in your pages before. What concerns me is the phenomena known as Tecnophobia, ie: fear of new technology suffered by many members of the older generation today. What is the Psychological basis for such a fear, I wonder. Does it stem from the inane fear of the unknown which has been suffered by mankind since the dawn of time. Or does it have other more complex causes? Young people like myself have adapted to new technology such as computers and video games with ease, while adults have trouble understanding the concepts behind computer and video games, so they despise them and feel suspicion and animosity towards them. Often parents feel that their child's video game system may have a long lasting damaging effect on the child's mind. Rumours abound about the damaging effects of video games, some based on fact but greatly distorted and others with no factual basis whatsoever. These rumours only serve to feed the suspicions parents have about video games. One such story states that video games can cause those who are playing them to suffer epileptic seizures. This is complete tripe. People are either epileptic or not. Whether or not they have a fit is up to them coming into contact with a particular catalyst. This can be flashing lights, moving patterns of lines (like escalator steps) or even sounds. So it is not the video games which are at fault, as these fits can happen anywhere. However this story twists the facts and is a scare campaign aimed at parents making them feel their child may be harmed by video games. Some, so-called experts say that video games are almost as addictive as drugs and can have deep and long-lasting effects on a child's mind. This conveys an image to parents that their little Johnny is going to become some kind of drugged wide eyed zombie from playing his video game system. In fact video games have some beneficial qualities if used in moderation. For example they can improve hand-eye co-ordination. I will not argue with the fact that video games will have a harmful effect if overused but everything will lead to some kind of sickness if overused. Adults must learn to adjust to the new technology and treat it as a useful tool and source of entertainment, not as an enemy. Computers and video games are not going to leave the face of this planet; they are here to stay. So we must make the most of them and use them to make our lives more productive and enjoyable. Thank you for listening to my point of view on this delicate but important area. I would be delighted to hear what other people have to say on the subject. Lorien Vecellio, New South Wales, Australia. YOB: You sad Aussie... hang on a minute this a damned good letter! Well as you've no doubt seen recently there has been a huge amount of concern about whether or not video games are the work of the devil. The epilepsy thing is an age old argument. The thing is that the flickering lights that occur on a television screen can induce a form of Epilepsy known as Photosensitive Epilepsy. This is very rare and is only suffered by about two percent of the population. This flickering can be emitted from the TV during normal viewing! The whole thing was blown out of all proportion and the strange thing was that The Sun had a front page detailing how terrible video games were (the \"Nintendo Killed My Son\" headline) and then in the centre pages was the Mega Guide screaming to the heavens just how great Sonic was! And the so-called experts? Just how many video games has he played? And how old is he? My guess is none and about 50. If people had just bothered to ask someone who knows what they're talking about, they could have given them the straight facts on video games rather than them just make up their own. Okay playing video games all day is not good for you but then neither is watching TV all day or had we forgotten that one? The best thing for all parents who suffer from Tecnophobia to do is play the games yourself! See that there's nothing to be afraid of. After all how many people's grandparents thought TV was great when it was first introduced? Failing that I'll come round and give you all a good kicking! GVG 034 "

"HUG REVIEW PC (386SX OR HIGHER) (tunt CREATIVE BY INFOGRAMES .99 Post-product for the boys! ver watched those American stuntman programmes which the telly people shove on when the normal show breaks down? Some of the things those fellers get up to are wild, to say the least! But what if you were sat in the cockpit of a stunt plane, gearing yourself up to perform a feat of unrivalled stupidity? And what's more, what if you then had to turn that stunt into a piece of cinematic action that'd leave the critics lost for words? Thanks to Infogrames and Disney, you can now do both on your PC with Stunt Island! sland COME FLY WITH ME Before you can turn your masterpiece into a stunning movie spectacular, you've first got to create the stunt. And who's the man fool enough to fart in the face of danger? Yourself, of course! Decide on the particular stunt you want to have a pop at, then jump into your plane and perform it! Should you muck it up, you can always have another try but if you're taking part in the competition, each 'take costs cash, and every time you fail at a stunt it'll cost money. O.K. Ace, congratulations, you made it to the show. The stunt coordinator. He's the lad who gives you your assignments. Piece of cake. Scene 1 Toke off and shoot a zero The Final scene in the Horld liar i epic. Taking off from the runway in your P-38 Lightning, you need to pull up before you hit the burning Zaro on the runway. Then, without going over 280 Feet, you need to shoot down another Zero that's bombing the Allies hangar's You have a shot linit of 40 Look at the lovely Gourad shading on that 747! There are another forty or so craft to choose from. SPOTTER PLATE VEL 54 STUNT COOROBCATOR  XE NAVIV  LEDGER «Not another PC flight simulator\" is probably what's going through your mind right now, but wipe that thought away immediately the flying in Stunt Island is a tiny part of the overall package! In fact, ever since it made its way into the CVG games room, I've been hooked. Stunt Island isn't a game as such it does have a basic flight sim element but it's really a creative package allowing the player to design, fly and film his own stunt movies from absolute scratch. What impresses me most, apart from the great presentation and fast, Gouradshaded graphics, is Stunt Island's ease of use. Although there's a useful 178page manual included in the box I, being an impatient so-and-so, simply leapt right in and came Oh up with a minutelong movie after half an hour! Okay, so my creation was crap, but the point is that you can be up and away within a very short space of time. If all you're interested in is blast, blast, blast, you may tire of Stunt Island, but it, like me, you've got a creative streak running through your veins, this is something that'll permanently take up room on your hard disk! PAUL RAND 00 000 B&B Any messages? How about \"Chuck that week-old doughnut away, you scruffy git!\" e 1454 Saed 78. PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES There's a massive variety of different craft to fly around fifty, in fact and they don't all have engines, or even wings for that matter! Take on the Jerries in the legendary Spitfire, or leap into an F-15 and cause all manner of havoc! Alternatively, you could turn your hand to big, Die Hard 2-type stunts in a massive Boeing 747, and even pilot a mega-expensive space shuttle! My current favourite though, has to be the mock meteor, which I used to create the visually incredible action adventure, Meteor 2 The Return, which basically sees said lump of space rock crashing into a hotel!

"GVG The cinema-goers watch intently as the hero makes his way down the runway, while bombs explode all around. 00339 00 000 OBJECTING STRONGLY Create your masterpiece in the editing room! If you don't want to attempt any of the pre-programmed stunts included in the package, or if you've completed them all (which should take a considerable length of time), why not build your own complete sets using all sorts of objects, from fences and pubs to Big Ben and Alcatraz Island! It's possible to build the smallest set in ever or the largest, most sprawling mock-up you can think of whatever you do, it's a simple case of picking a free spot, working out which of the eight hundred-plus objects you wish to use, and letting your imagination run wild! And to allow you to film your newly-formed stunt, there are eight cameras available which you can position anywhere you wish; on the ground, on top of vehicles, behind your aircraft, all there to capture the action so that, when it comes to editing your movie, you've got everything you need to come up with a flick that Arnie would beg to star in! MOVIES! MOVIES! MOVIES! \"Scuse me mate, do you cross the Mersey? Dey do dough, don't dey? Ey, calm down! The enemy has chosen his timing well it's much harder to dogfight in the dark. Right, the film's been edited so well that you can't see the joins. It's packed with perils, sound effects are spot on and the tunes are terrific! The audience is waiting to see the latest from Stunt Island, so get yourself into the theatre and show it to 'em! As in the editing room, you can view any part of your movie by using the VCR controls at the bottom of the screen; whack it right to the beginning, watch the film and see the crowd go wild at the end! Build your set! Select your plane! That's the enemy, flying over the wreckage of one of his downed compatriots. AIRFIELD HOUSING DEL Piper Cherokee 60657 Park at the hamburger stond COMPETITION TIME!

The movie world revolves around cash, and you can become a figure-juggler in Stunt Island! Play in competition mode and you'll have to balance the budget as well as perform all the other functions that go into making an all-action visual spectacular! Each take costs money, and if you foul up you'll lose a large amount of your wedge!

"PU REVIEW Gently does it! Phew! Now all you've got to do is land on that catapult and fire yourself back into the skies! Eh? Bloody hell!! To become Milk Tray Man, you've first got to go through a rigorous series of tests. In this one, you've got to fly through the gate of this castle... Will he make it? CLOSE TO THE EDIT You spawny get! Where Stunt Island really comes into its own is its editing facility. After you've flown your stunt, the film from the cameras you had set up (there can be up to eight) is taken to the editing room, ready and waiting for you to splice and dice to your heart's content. A very simple yet incredibly effective feature, editing is controlled by a bank of video recorderlike controls which allow you to fast forward and rewind, advance or backtrack frame by frame, pause the film or play. The screen is split in two; one half for the unedited footage spool and the other for the completed movie spool. When you've chosen a piece of footage to include in your film, hit the Start Marker to indicate the beginning of the piece and the End marker where you wish to stop. Then just record your snippet onto the second spool; it will be pasted into whichever position you have chosen it to be added. Continue the process, using all your reels of film, to build up a complete film packed with clever camera angles, not to mention sound effects and music (there's a library of both to delve into), credits, swanky fades and the like, et voila! Your movie is ready for viewing! You have a granulated ball joint, a broken leg, eight broken ribs, and a minor brain tumor (which we've already removed; it's in this jar, see?). We'll have you patched up and Flying again tomorrow. This one's quite smart. MAKE SOME NOISE See the large barn there? There's nothing like a stirring soundtrack and in-movie ditties to add to a film's atmosphere, but think what it would be like were it totally silent dull, probably. So why not add a tune and effects? Shove in a sound card and you're given over two dozen tracks to choose from, ranging from car chase tunes to country ditties. If it's sound effects you're after though, you're going to need a Soundblaster or Thunderboard card. With either of these plugged in, you have access to a wide array of noises and speech which can add greatly to the overall atmosphere of your production. There are some noises included which play through the bog-standard PC speaker but, as you can guess, they're not the highest quality ever. And those rapidlyapproaching combine harvesters? Because of the unusual nature of this software package, we felt it inappropriate to give Stunt Island the normal Graphics, Sound, Gameplay and Value ratings. What you get out of Stunt Island is what you put into it, which is why we've given an Overall rating only. The trick is to fly through... Da-daah! It's Parachute Man! CVG ISLAND HOPPING Without hit. ting anything. Just like that! Stunt Island is located on, strangely enough, a large island! Owned by a movie production conglomerate, it's a fairly desolate place, but that's no bad thing because, by using the vast assortment of different props at your disposal, you can create an array of sets! Build the City of London, complete with Big Ben and Tower Bridge, or construct an entire WWII setting, full of Nazi planes and trucks to blow up the only limit is your imagination! HIT GVG 038 "

"GVG REVIEW CVO MEGADRIVE PLATFORM BATMAN SIE REVENGE OF THE JOKER\" BY SEGA .99 The townsfolk are calling on you. MY BATARANG WON'T COME BACK All is not well in Gotham City. Precious metals are mysteriously disappearing from mines around the city. One of these metals has a highly toxic content used to build missile warheads. The Police are baffled and the City's resources are getting lower by the day. There's only one thing for it, call in a professional Batman. The Caped Crusader instantly recognises this as the work of the evil Joker (he's clever like that you see). Somewhat peeved at getting his monkey ass kicked by the Caped one some time ago, the Joker has returned for some serious revenge. But it's up to you to get out there and stop him, or the whole of Gotham City will suffer. What use would a super-herobe without his array of special weapons? Not much. So thankfully Batman has plenty. The Batarang is the Caped Crusader's bog standard weapon. When fired, it chases the enemy until they're hit. The Crossbow fires a powerful explosive arrow, the Sonic Neutraliser fires a pair of Batarangs in a criss-crossing pattern, which is very useful when a baddie is shielded by a crate and the Shield Star throws three, star-shaped darts in different directions. Hold your finger down on the button to release a The evil Joker plans special weapon a la' R-Type. his mischief. Your bullets cannot harm me... WHO'S THE BOSS Batman is dead famous for, having a considerable What exactly is that behind you? amount of foes, and there's a fair few super-villains in this cart. In the first level you'll come face to face with Ace Ranger. Although he's kitted out with a pretty large gun, he's no problem to beat, provided you've got your O MLETVE Batarangs. The Minedroid is blocking your way to the fourth level, and it doesn't stop there you've still got the Master CPU, The Joker himself, and the surprise end-of-game bad guy to beat. I'm not going to tell you about him, but he's dead hard! LED DOO Oh I'm a little teapot Not much going on here is there? THE BAT'S BACK What a pile of old cack! Batman: Revenge Of The Joker looks cheesy from start to finish. The main character sprite is acceptable but all the rest of the graphics (especially the backdrops) look as though they've been lifted straight from a Master System game! The game itself is just so frustrating. The Very Poor levels have been so badly designed and put together, that it's a real effort to get through any of them. Things like. Not being able to hit a baddie when you get too close to him, and having moving platforms the same colour as the backdrops. All of these problems make the game too irritating to bother to play even with some good in-between level stills! PAUL ANGLIN GRAPHICS % Batman has been a little quiet as of late. With only one appearance on a sad Saturday morning cartoon, and one NES game to his name, things aren't looking good ET STREET for the Caped Crusader. Batman Returns on the NES is due out in a couple of months, but the biggie is Batman Returns on the Mega CD! This is due out any day now on import. This game-of-the-cloaked one looks as though it could be the first decent Mega CD game. We shall see. STRATEGY SKILL CVG 5059 SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % % % 58 GVG 040 ACTION REFLEXES CVG "

"GUG REVIE BREVEMAN SNES IN THE THICK OF IT ARCADE ADVENTURE GHOSTS Looking like refugees from Pac Man, ghosts come in three colours and take between five and fifteen shots to kill. Wipe out all the ghosts in a room to open an exit or collect a token. BY SONY IMAGESOFT .00 BATThese giant, purple blood-suckers swoop in low and straight at you. They become increasingly difficult to kill the further you travel. At first, simply shoot them in the head as they come for you. On later levels, repeat the process but move to the side and shoot again. If you manage to destroy them you can expect to receive any number of goodies, including keys and health-giving apples. TROLL One of the bigger ghouls that stop your progress across the island. Trolls drop from the sky and annoyingly jump up and down whilst lurching toward you. Keep a safe distance and jump and fire to hit them in the head. Defeat the bald giant and you'll be rewarded with life tokens. SPINNING DEVILS Chase you around the room and are invulnerable until they stop to catch their breath. Pummel away at them in short bursts. he roled shadwhere of G Take to the high ground and pick 'em off. NES owners are spoilt for choice when it comes to top blasters, but if you crave something that'll make you think a little, you're less than well catered for. Until now, that is. Enter Equinox, the 3D sequel to Solstice. You take on the role of Glendaal, son of the great wizard Shadax, who has been imprisoned somewhere in the vast underground dungeons of Galedonia. Entering the fray completely unarmed, you must fight your way through a dizzying maze of battlezones. Stuffed to the gills with a bewildering array of traps and terrors, this isn't a place for the faint-hearted. Let's hope the old fart's worth it! SO WHAT'S THE RUB? Glendaal must travel through every kingdom in the eight level world, braving the hordes of monsters that run amok throughout. In each kingdom you must descend into the dungeons below to unlock doors, use retrieved objects and collect spells that'll help you make your journey to Shadax's prison a little less of a nightmare. MAGIC Nawisnou EQUINOX MAPPING IT OUT It's about time a game like Equinox came out on the SNES! Sony has s taken some of the best aspects of adventure gaming and dumped them slap-bang in the middle of a gorgeous 3D extravaganza! There's no denying that the perspective is hard on the eyes, with objects looking like they're directly in front of you when in fact they're several paces away, but you do get used to it. The great thing is that, unlike standard RPGs, with isometric adventures you can see everything that's going on and, with some stunning Mode 7 rotations on the map screens, the whole thing is spectacular to control and play. The variety of monsters, puzzles, weapons and potions is staggering and, if you can get over the initial irritation of being fooled by the 3D projecting an image that isn't really there you won't give up until you've finished the game. Brilliant! ATHENA This town consists of a handful of villages supported by wooden platforms that float above the murky dungeon world of a sunken castle. GALADONIA Your home. There are three villages here and the underground dungeons that you'll find are relatively small to begin with. TORI The forest kingdom to the south of Galadonia. Here you'll find four villages that are the starting point of a rough network of dungeon caverns. QUAGMIRE This location hides yet another swampy dungeon underneath it's marshes. It's hard to navigate and the only way in is through the five villages above. DEESO This barren desert kingdom lies to the east of Galadonia. Its eerie dungeons are littered with the remains of ancient civilisations and so it's predictable that they are haunted by all manner of spooks! AFRALONA A huge kingdom engulfed by the sea that conceals a sprawling tomb. With an impassible mountain range to the east you'll have to come in via the south-eastern corner, across the sea, if you want to get to the final stage. DEATH ISLAND The frozen isle provides the entrance to the last giant dungeon below and can only be reached by sea. It's the resting place of the evil sorceress Sonia, as well as your father's prison. STEVE KEEN The secret of teleportation is yet to be discovered. CVG 044 "


"REVIEW CUE CVG BARE ESSENTIALS BLOBS The most intelligent of the lot. Their bouncing movements are very hard to predict. Just keep on the move and bide your time. KNIGHTS These guys are heavily armour-plated and can only be taken out from behind! Their metal suits are rather like hospital smocks, in that when they swivel round you get to see their exposed rumps! The best tactic is to follow behind them, shooting frantically as you go. Glendaal begins the game with just the clothes on his back and a turban on his head. The first thing to do is find a suitable weapon and there are a lot to choose from. Our man can chuck up to three projectiles at a time, from daggers, shuriken, axes, twin daggers, swords, scimitars, maces and twin swords. What! You want more? Well, the lad is quite a magician in his spare time and collects spells like they're going out of style! He can heal himself, slow the enemy down, freeze them, destroy an entire room, deplete an opponent's energy, reveal any movable objects and unlock doors now that's what I call magic! Equinox is a treat from beginning to end; not that we've seen it completed yet! The graphics are dead smart and I can't recall seeing a better-looking isometric game ever. Even the monsters seem to jump right off the screen at you! Every aspect of scrolling arcade escapades has been included, with huge exploding guardians and pick-ups galore to please the hack and slay fans, along with the plethora of moving blocks, locked doors and tricky puzzles for the more sedate among you. There's a plot within a plot, too; although the main objective is to find the five strings to your magical harp, the only way you can do this is to collect the twelve tokens scattered throughout the levels. In short, a cart for all the family! This will grow and grow on you and for anyone who liked Actraiser and Soulblazer, this is a combination of the two, so buy it as soon as you can! GARTH SUMPTER Good timing and fast reflexes are what you need here. The first guardian takes some killing, but it's worth it! Let's hope you have more luck than this sucker! STRATEGY SKILL BAD BOYS At the end of every dungeon you'll be tested by a huge guardian. These guys are some of the toughest you'll encounter, so don't even dream about beating them first time round. Here's what you can expect to be faced with: PINCHA The only parts of this beast that can be touched are his eyes, which he protects with his huge claws. Time your shots correctly when he swings at you. DOLLOP A big blob of slime that'll waste no time in throwing globules of goo at you! BONE HEAD Scuttles around very quickly and tries to run you over whilst throwing ghosts at you. EYESIS Another tough one. The spinning pyramid's only soft spot is the very peak of its structure. ACTION REFLEXES DUNG DUNG Hides out in the soil and springs up from out of nowhere to hurl boulders at you. QUETZALCOATL An enormous living statue with more than a few surprises up his concrete sleeves! BILLY BONES The last villain on the circuit. He's the ghastly ghostly galleon captain who never stops shooting his exploding cannonballs at you! GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE CVG % 90 % 80 % 88 % A few quick daggers in the bum and he'll see things your way! Looks like you're surrounded. 88 88 CVG GVG 045 "

"GUG REVIEW MEGADRIVE PICK A PUNCHER! SPORTS SIM BY VIRGIN .99 Muhammed Ali Heavyweight Boxing features ten pugilists, each possessing their own particular skills and strengths. One fighter may be tops when it comes to fast punching but could tire easily, while another might be ahead on points in the strength department but be a bit of a slowcoach. The ten are placed in order of excellence, with the worst at number ten and the undisputed heavyweight champion, Ali himself, at the top of the pile. You can control any of the characters yes, even Muhammed himself which allows for a large variety of difficulty settings.   :  He's the greatest! Hey! That's a witty play on Frank Bruno's name NOT! Doxing games have, by their very nature, not been the most impressive titles ever to hit computers and consoles. There's been the very odd success, such as Mindscape's 4D Sports Boxing on the 16-bits, but other than that, they've all been crude conversions of limited gameplay coin-ops. But when Virgin decided to tie up the rights to use heavyweight legend Muhammed Ali in a game, they didn't want to waste the license. Muhammed Ali Heavyweight Boxing has been hailed as one of the greats of the genre; is the game a knockout? Or does it end up on the ropes, a shambling, Michael Dokes-like failure, in the first round? HEAVYWEIGHT B ARCADE OR SIM? BaBy, Some boxing games are straight arcade beat 'em ups, while others, like the aforementioned 4D Sports Boxing, lean more to the simulation side of gaming. Muhammed Ali Heavyweight Boxing, on the other hand, features both types of gameplay! Select the Arcade option and you control your boxer using the direction pad for movement around the ring with the fire buttons acting as punch and block controls. Opt for Simulation, however, and the entire control system changes totally, with the various punches being thrown using a mixture of both direction and fire button presses. And a kiss from a lovely ladyhurrah for everything! cool? POWER EXTREME The problem with the majority of fight games is that they're purely arcade actionbased, allowing for cool little in the way of strategy. Muhammed Ali Heavyweight Boxing, on the other hand, gives the player the option to play either Arcade or Simulation mode, increasing the longevity of the package instantly. This really is a good-looker; while the characters are sprite-based, the ring is constructed of polygons allowing for fast, fluid movement and impressive camera effects. But it's the gameplay that ultimately makes Muhammed Ali one to watch for; you need to think strategically, even in Arcade mode to a degree, if you want to get to the top and, because you can select any of the ten fighters to control, you can basically make the game as easy or difficult as you wish. I reckon this is just what the British Boxing Board of Control doctor ordered; take a look and you'll agree. PAUL RAND GVG 048 czMUDOU) Hard Soreet Punches Lef Right Bon Screen Defend Jabs Hold Down  These boxers aren't invincible the game would be pretty boring if the two battlers just stood and slugged it out forever. Each fighter has two power bars; one for strength and the other for punching speed. The more punches you throw, the faster your speed bar decreases, making it more difficult to both let loose with effective attacks and put up your guard quickly enough to block your opponent's blows. Come into contact with the opposing fighter's fist and your power bar will go down if it hits rock bottom you'll be out for the count! Obviously, the same applies to the other bloke in the ring with you, should you hit him. And, if you're running low on power, it's a good idea to do a Chris Eubank-esque run around the ring. dodging the opponent's attacks while you regain lost energy.

Arhammad It's not quantity, but quality of punches that count! The only boxing game I ever enjoyed was that old coin-op classic, Punch Out. Since then I've been looking for a decent console version of the noble art' without even a whiff of success. But Muhammed Ali Heavyweight Boxing reeks of a quality that hasn't been apparent in most boxing games. The perspective of the ring gives loads of freedom of movement, which means you're not forced into situations where you're hammered by a constant barrage of punches with nowhere to run to. Play the game in Arcade mode and you'll be in an all-out scrap to put Bruno Franko on the mat for good, but switch to Simulation and you'll have to worry about every little aspect of the fight. The tournament mode is a real challenge, and thankfully there's a password option included. We've been waiting a long time for a decent boxing game it's here at last!

Ali!'. There's a mountain more digitised speech included in the game, as well as other little touches such as the facial damage inflicted on each fighter showing up on-screen. Great stuff!

"GUG GIE REVIEW SNES PLATFORM Baldies with flamethrowers whatever next? Duck! BY OCEAN .99 he magic is back! Riggs and Murtaugh hit the SNES in their first console adventure! Ever since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover teamed up in the original Lethal Weapon movie, gamers the world over have been crying out for a version on their machines and now they've got one! Lethal Weapon The Game isn't actually a conversion of any one of the three films, more an original adventure based around the concept of the movie series. The lethal lads have got to crack a number of different cases to win the game a difficult task considering there seems to be a city's worth of scum trying to stop them! SCORE 0000000 AS IF BY MAGIC, RIGGS APPEARED! The action starts at police headquarters, with each mission being undertaken by walking through one of the doors in HQ. The player can decide to control either Riggs or Murtaugh, by walking over to the left of the screen where the locker room is situated. As if by magic, you emerge as the other copper, leaving your partner-in-crimebusting behind. Beats the clothes-changing scene in Mr Benn into a cocked hat, doesn't it! MISSION 2 --maana Yes, that is supposed to be Mel Gibson! SEQRE 2eee se ( 9) LOOK AT THE CLIP ON THAT! DIDUGIDORESHINESE Lethal Weapon wouldn't be Lethal Weapon without a lethal weapon with which to shoot people, and both characters carry with them a police-issue revolver that wipes out those baddies in a thrice! The trouble with guns, though, is that they tend to run out of ammunition at the most inopportune times, so it's a good job that their enemies have left a load of ammo clips lying around each level and phew! They're the same calibre as your guns! Freddie Mercury spotted on building site shocker! Give Ocean a perfectly good license such as Lethal Weapon and what does it do? Turn it into yet another platform game! What's more, it isn't a particuc larly good one at that. Graphically the game's a non-starter, with laughable sprites (if Mel Gibson ever sees what Ocean has done to him on the SNES screen, he'd probably turn up at the offices with a big gun!) and backdrops that are flat and uninspiring. There's absolutely nothing new here; just bland, although to be fair, challenging, platform action. I may be in the minority, but if companies insist on churning out endless platformers I at least want snazzy graphics and something perhaps a little out of the ordinary (even a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up section just SOMETHING!). What I don't expect is a SNES game that looks like it was programmed in 1987 and had a big license stuck on the end to make some easy cash. PAUL RAND CVG SUURET 01010101010 Swing Mel!

"REVIEW GUE AVC LETHAL LADS eeee360 If you go into the missions today, you're in for a big surprise. If you go into the missions today, you'd better go in disguise. Or at least with a massive big gun and a load of bullets, 'cos each mission you take on is absolutely packed to the gunnels with a wide assortment of nasties who'll not think twice about filling you full of lead or worse! Terrorists planting bombs in shopping centres, hoodlums wielding large flamethrowers and pieces of metal, and even massive alligators living in the sewage system are ready and waiting to give you a run for your money! No, no, no, no, NO! This is not what the doctor ordered and it's not the sort of thing that Ocean should be palming the punters off with. It's just another example of a tired old formula. Spend the majority of your cash on a licence and then knock together a pile of old cack with the thirty bob left over, using no variety and a few old ideas found in a corner. Lethal Weapon calls time on the genre. There's a bit of muzak, a few spot effects, the bare minimum of background detail and well-iffy sprites. A bit of let-down really, as the puzzle element of the game can be quite challenging at times. When it comes to the crunch, the overall feeling of having seen this all before is more overpowering thanan over-ripe old cheese. Pweeghhh! GARTH Oh no! Shark attack! NEVER BE WITHOUT A VEST Being a copper in America is a dangerous job, so it pays to look after yourself. In Lethal Weapon, you're equipped with a suit of body armour which is damaged with each enemy hit; should you be attacked wearing no armour, you lose a life. Keep your eyes open throughout the stages, though, and you will notice spare suits just walk over one and it'll repair the armour you're wearing!

"FUE REVIEW LIONHEART AMIGA PLATFORM BY THALION .99 A TOKEN GESTURE Yes, that most famous aspect of platform based games, be they hack 'em ups or cutesy orientated, makes an appearance in Lionheart the coins! Well okay, they're actually arrow-shaped tokens, but they're much the same thing. The handy little pick-ups can be found dotted all around the screen. Rather than give you an extra life, these tokens will replenish one life heart to maximum capacity. Who said originality was dead? Great backdrops, eh? THE SKY AT NIGHT Vladyn was a feared warrior who spent all of his spare time quaffing ale and getting into scraps. One particular night a couple of the king's guards ran in and carted him off to the royal palace, by order of the king himself. The problem was that the great mystical symbol, known only as the Lionheart, had been stolen by the dreaded Norka, and Vladyn was the only man brave enough to get it back. On top of that, Norka had also carted off Vladyn's girly our lad was understandably upset, and quickly set off on his quest... Thalion is having something of a good run of late. Its previous effort, No Second Prize, was reviewed just a few issues ago and rolled in with a creditable 88%. And watch out for a potential stunner by the name of Ambermoon. This is, as you might have guessed, the sequel to the ever-so-successful Amberstar. It'll be a little while before this one is ready for the CVG treatment, but come the time we'll make sure it gets just that. Now that's what I call a death slide! That's right, Vladyn. You lounge around when there's work to be done. There's tokens-a-plenty on that platform to your left, MOVE ON UP Thalion has gone and turned in an extremely challenging variation on the old theme, with excellent graphics which almost make you believe that you're in a world full of flying nasties and huge, eight-legged monsters, all after your blood. There's enough depth in Lionheart to keep you going for weeks the Ark, for example, will have you absolutely ripping your hair out as you try and work out how to kill the damned thing! The only slight niggle I have with Lionheart is that some parts of the game are so frustratingly hard that it takes ages before you can even see what you're supposed to do, let alone actually be able do it! The double ending gives the player extra incentive to play the game beyond completion Lionheart is excellent stuff! PAUL Vladyn didn't get where he is today by being a namby pamby old softy. He's trained long and hard to become the warrior he is. There are a load of long vines along the landscapes that Vladyn can swing from, Prince of Persia style, as well as climb up and walk along them. The lad is also a dab hand at using the many platforms that are dotted around the landscape. The secret to success in Lionheart is to look for all the platforms, some of which cannot even be instantly seen. But these ones usually lead the way to the tokens, or even the odd secret level! Presenting Vladyn, tightrope walker extraordinaire. 00 Excuse me, I'd like to get past now. ANGLIN A nice stroll down by the riverside.

Any software house who sticks out a golfing sim must be either extremely confident or very stupid, as the competition's stiffer than the audience at a Sam Fox Wet T-shirt contest! Nicky boy's hardly short of a few skins, so quite why he's put his name to yet another golfing extravaganza is a bit of a puzzler, but endorse one he has. So what has the greatest golfer in the world today' got to offer on the humble Amiga? Read on and find out! Nice advice, Nick NOT! The programmers of Nick Faldo's Championship Golf have gone for ultra realism graphics-wise, with the most HUMAN & LEE L stunning renderings of lush green courses and detailed surHE ALL HIT THE WATER. SOMETIMES. roundings ever seen on the Amiga. Keeping up appearances, PENALTY DROP FROM WIEM POSITION there's a barrel-load of digitised sound effects including thwacking noises, birds in the trees, water splashing and ricochets. When balls hit trees, groups of leaves flutter to the ground and whenever you land in the rivers, there's an almighty spray of water a great effect! Now that's what Not quite the shot we wanted. call a water trap! PRACTISE MAKES PERFECT STANCE 02 NICK FALDO'S GOLF STROKE PLAY 1 2 3 4 MATCH PLAV Picking up the skills needed to get a few birdies is not easy, but there are a whole series of pros on hand, to pass comment on your shots in the training mode. They're not very helpful, but at least you can get a few holes in before being dumped in at the deep end. There's an endless amount of clubs to choose from, and if you don't know your fiveiron from your sand wedge you'd better learn fast! The computer players are ranked in skill levels right up to Faldo himself even Joe Average is a bit of a hustler so don't be too proud to go for the dope! 1 2 2 STERN COURSE 1 2 SPRING SUMMER WINTE SEASON WHAT'S ON THE MENU? CONTINUE Options galore! NFCG is graphically stunning a good walk has never looked so good on your Amiga. The lakes and water obstacles ripple realistically, and the character animation is spot on. However, things are not as good as you might at first think. It's really easily to get disorientated when you're taking a shot out of the rough; the cursor on the map is tiny and if you land in a bunker, god forbid, you could be there all day hunting down your position on the course. Nick Faldo's Championship Golf is brilliant to look at and incredibly fast, conTrother sidering the immense Pick detail, but at the end my nose of the day gaming is all about fun and, with this game's sluggish learning curve produced by the difficulty of control, you won't have much of that. Still, it's worth taking a look just for the smart graphics. STEVE KEEN PLAYER SELECT THERE I PEPEE HUER ESTER ET THE END DEL LOAD SAUE Before each shot, you'll be expected to adjust stance, direction, angle, club, power and top spin/backspin that's even before you've checked the wind speed and direction! Fortunately, the menus pop up instantaneously whenever you move the cursor towards the far edges of the screen making it not quite the chore that it sounds. On the other hand, it's not much fun either!

"GVG REVIEW CAGIC RO SNES PLATFORMA PLATFORM BY SONY IMAGESOFT .99 As Van Halen said... Jump! Look out for the coconuts lobbed at you from palm trees. life at the beginning of time was certainly no bowl of cherries just ask poor old Chuck Rock. Generous to a fault, loving husband and all-round nice guy, the granitejawed caveman hero of Sony's latest platform romp has had his beautiful wife Ophelia kidnapped by the spiteful villain of the piece, Gary Gritter (ho ho). Never one to take matters lying down, our Chuck has stuffed himself full of fattening dino-snacks to achieve maximum flab-factor (don't worry, it's all explained in a minute) and set off across five stages of prehistoric madness to give the evil Gazza a good bashing and re-unite himself with his loving spouse. He may be a lumbering troglodyte with a body odour problem that could strip paint at fifty yards, but Chuck knows that a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. The only question is, can YOU do it? STAGES OF EVOLUTION Look at that size of that dinosaur! Each of Chuck Rock's five stages has a distinctly prehistoric theme and is broken down into a number of sub-levels, each of which must be completed in turn. Starting off in the Jungle, Chuck must also battle through an erupting volcano, a primordial swamp, a frozen ice-age wasteland and finally a dinosaur Crossing the prehistoric swamp, dino-style. graveyard. The objective of each level is simply to get to the exit at the far right of the landscape as quickly as possible, with a big boss dinosaur or other such fearsome guardian to battle at the end of each stage's final level. Nice. Here's a sneaky peek at the Mega CD version lumme! BELLY LAUGHS M . Having been converted from an Amiga game that is now getting on in years somewhat, Chuck Rock can't help but look a little dated when held up to similar titles. It's not that it's badly designed; it's in the execution that the problem lies. The game's just too sluggish and slow for any real sense of fun to develop and, because the sprites are quite large and chunky, there's never much room to move around, which soon becomes frustrating. Of course, if you're willing to learn all the pitfalls and baddy attack patterns you'll succeed, but I honestly couldn't find any incentive to do so. Chuck Rock is by LamE! no means one of the worst platform games available on the_SNES, but it doesn't really contribute anything to the genre, and so unless you're a die-hard platform fanatic, I can't see you getting much fun for your forty quid. Chuck Rock isn't the brainiest of lads, and he's forgotten to arm himself with a club or spear prior to setting out to rescue Ophelia. It's a bit of a stroke of luck, then, that Chuck is such a fat git, because his wobbling belly acts as the ideal defence against the multitude of assailants. When an enemy gets within range, all Chuck need do is shake his hips to lash out with a lethal quivering stomach blow. Unfortunately, Chuck's belly isn't quite THAT big, so an enemy has to get very close before he's within striking range. Chuck uses his belly to see off a baddy. GARTH SUMPTER cVG 056 "


"REVIEW GUE AVE CHUCKING ROCKS in Ouch! Tumbling rocks bounce off Chuck's cranium. One of Chuck Rock's most remarkable skills is his ability to... chuck rocks! In these prehistoric lands, there are big boulders lying scattered all over the place, and with Chuck being the beefy feller he is, it's no problem for him to pick them up and carry them around. Armed with a giant rock, he can then throw it to squash baddies or use it as a mobile platform from which to gain extra height for tricky jumps. One word of warning though these boulders are heavy, and control over Chuck is much more sluggish, with slower walking speed and shorter jumps when he's carrying one. Chuck Rock is a strange game to convert to SNES. Even though it received impressive reviews and sold in none-too-small quantities when it was released on Amiga, we're nonetheless talking about a title that's well over eighteen months old. Its age shows; Chuck comes from a time when the cutesy style was king, whereas these days, games just seem that much \"harder'. Graphically it's blocky and far too gaudy, making it difficult to follow exactly what is going on in some of the levels. And on the subject of levels, they're just too similar to one another; there's little in the way of variation and, although they can be quite tricky, you gradually tire of doing the same thing over and over again. Poor Chuck he was a bit of a cult hero in his day, but that day is long since past and, while you won't feel ripped off if you buy this cart, you'll definitely feel as though you could have made a wiser purchasing decision. Some helpful birds can pick you up and carry you over dangers. BAD BAD BOYS MEER Duck to avoid the rolling stones. PAUL RAND Putting aside the glaring prehistorical inaccuracies for a moment (cavemen and dinosaurs living in the same time period? I don't think so), there's a weird and wonderful array of enemies just itching to snuff out Chuck's life. Dinosaurs of all shapes and size comprise the main threat (although some can be helpful, with the big brontosaurs carrying Chuck across rivers), with fish and birds all helping to hinder your quest. The latter are particularly pesky with their aerial attacks, so Chuck also has a jumping kick in his armoury to deal with these. STRATEGY SKILL APALALAL Chuck needs all his skill to get past these big boulders. ACTION REFLEXES Chuck demonstrates his amazing rock picking-up skills. YUM YUM! Points can be accumulated by bashing the belligerent baddies or by collecting the many different prehistoric pick-ups. For reasons which no palaeontologist could possibly fathom, these can be found scattered just about everywhere. There's a special set of goodies for each level, ranging from orange slices that award a measly 200 points to big bones (phwoar) worth a spanking 10,000 pointeroonies. In addition, hearts can be collected which will top up Chuck's energy supply. GRAPHICS % 76 SOUND % 60 GAMEPLAY % 72 VALUE % CVG Urgh! A stagnant slime swamp! & CVG CVG 057 "

"GVG GVE REVIE SNES BEAT 'EM UP BY LORICIEL .99 NOW FIGHT! Take it like a man, on the chin! DING PAD SNES SELECT SELECT HITS PHYSICAL TYPE ER LOOK OPTIONS NEXT BO EVIEHT TRAININ Customise to your heart's content. WORK IT OUT! The 'Match' is where the action is. Fight against a friend or the computer it really doesn't matter. Choose from a whole bank of opponents with different qualities, and even adapt their looks. it's up to you how long each bout is, but once your five lights have flickered off the screen, you're out for thrcount. Defeat all-comers and you'll progress to the ultimate challenge, 'Kumate', in which you fight six adversaries in turn. It's no holds barred and each guy's tougher than the last! High fliers, watch out! To be the best you've got to train hard, like a third division footballer and then claw your way to the top. A quick trip to the gym should sort you out. To take on the rock-hard skull crackers you have to considerably boost your vital attribute percentages by pummelling gym equipment. Whacking away at the bag with the 'B' button increases strength, sparring with a foppish opponent pushes up resistance and, to bolster your reflexes, kick one of three pads when they pop out towards you. 89 01 02 As a bit of a martial arts expert, Inothing narks me more than inaccuracies in fighting games. Best Of The Best was originally released as Panza Kick Boxing, named after the famous French fighter, Andre Panza but for the SNES it's all changed. Although the cart retains all the garb, pads and dress of the kick boxing game, you've now been thrown into a karate championship. Kick boxing is nothing like karate; if the big bods at Loriciel had wanted to swap names that badly, they should have made the content authentic! The game caused quite a stir on PC and Amiga due to the sheer number of moves: there were tons of them, produced by digitising Panza's fighting techniques and drawing over them. How does this system fare on the SNES? Read on.. Best Of The Best has huge potential that's never fulfilled. Digitised footage of real kick-boxers, using scores of moves, should mean an incredible fighting experience. The animation is amazing and knocks the stuffing out of every other beat 'em up around, SF2 included. However, BOTB takes a severe nose-dive in playability. Each movement determines a different attack pattern, but the time MMM... taken to execute one can NOT last for up to two seconds! V BADI Also, the fighters tend to be drawn together too often, making it impossible to make contact. Very frustrating. If you can work around these bugs you'll find the game a treat, but fast action freaks beware progression and combat are sloooow! STEVE KEEN 83 04 85 Roll up! Roll up! Get your hits here. 68 The reverse spinning back-hander, my fave! THE PERFECT COMBINATION Eat your pixels out, Streetfighter 2! BOTB has no less than 55 (gumph!) kicks and punches to choose from. They're all stored in the hit list, so skim through them, pick 13, and position them around the joypad to be used wherever needed. Some tactics will work on some opponents better than others but once you've found a couple of really awesome combinations, stick to them: you won't be beat. Get that strength built up! Down but not out! If you can't take it to the body try the happy sacks! STRATEGY CVG SKILL GRAPHICS SOUND SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 90 % 78 % 79 % 79 ACTION REFLEXES CVG "

"CHARACTER PROFILES NAME: Steve Keen AGE: 24 WEIGHT: 13st 10lbs HEIGHT: 6'2\" BEST GAME EVER: Super Mario Kart PURE ATMOS! NAME: Steve Merrett AGE: 22 WEIGHT: llst HEIGHT: 5'10\" BEST GAME EVER: Sensible Soccer ave you ever heard that there's a smidgen of rivalry between CVG and its sister publication, Nintendo Magazine System? Yes? Well, you of course must also know that the CVG boys are the best gamers on the planet, but those prattling pranetts at NMS still beg to differ! So, with the acrid smell of battle (and devoured odour eaters) in our nostrils, we decided to throw down the gauntlet. The mother of all magazine battles was arranged, with one nominated player from each team to go head-to-head playing a single game in a toughas-old-boots sudden death wipe out! SAD CHEATS AHOY!! With the contenders chosen, the atmosphere at CVG Towers was electric. All that remained was to find a game that neither of the boys had played. Luckily enough, those generous chaps at UBI Soft came to the rescue. They came whizzing over from their London offices with a spanking new copy of their latest game, Jimmy Connors' Tennis, and a whopping magnum of La Champagne for the victor! After a few choice tips from the UBI professionals, the two boys knocked up for a few minutes before the games were declared open. As the third game began the NMS toady just couldn't keep it to himself any longer and blurted out that he'd received an imported copy of the game the day before and had perfected his incredible services at home! It was no good complaining now. Steve K battled on, pulling back two games before losing the third. Keen knew he was really up against it, and decided that the situation called for a few well-timed coughs and chokes in order to try and put Merrett off his deadly serves. It worked! The NMS bozo completely lost his concentra tion, allowing keeny to equalise. Three all! The TIHE ball was firmly in Keen's court now the lad had 00.05.16 truly found his Wimbledon legs, smacking a few well-placed scorchers of his own at Merrett and CONNORS 3 taking the next two games. -CONNORS 2 AVG INTER-MAG CHALLENGE FIGHTING TALK THE BIG FIGHT IS ON! HOT STUFF After much squabbling as to who was going to have the honour of representing the CVG crew, Steve Keen was shoved forward; partly because he says he's a games playing demon, but mostly because he weighs fourteen stones and has a black belt in judo. Lumme! His clued-up opponent was to be none other than Mr Sleaze NMS's deputy editor, Steve Merrett. Merrett is not entirely new to competing in games c h a m pionships; last year he won the Butlins' Streetfighter tournament but only by lying about his age! Both players opted for the skills of Connors himself and selected traditional Wimbledon grass for the combat zone. Steve M began as he meant to go on by delivering a string of blistering, chalk dust serves. These inept tactics seemed to work though, as the best Steve Keen could muster were a few aimless swats at the highly poilished balls that were coming towards him. (Eh? -Ed) Two games down and the CVG boy began to smell a very large rodent! NMS champ was just too classy, a trait that anyone who knows him would realise is well out of character! Steve M was beginning to feel the heat and, as the rest of the CVG boys began to chant \"LOOOOSERRR! at the sad NMS cheat, Keen realised that his home crowd advantage was beginning to pay off. Merrett was now five-three down and fluttering all over the court in desperation, as he tried to scrape back a point or two. But Steve 'Giant Killer Keen was having none of it, kicking the young pretender into the middle of next month as he hit the final killing stroke to beat the NMS sad lad by an incredible 6-3! The war was over, the champagne flowed and we were left to reflect on yet another fine CVG triumph. won against all odds. What a bunch of heroes eh? (And what a bloody cheating slimeball that Steve had to play too!) If you think you're good enough to take on the CVG boys at their own games, fill in the form below and hey? Who knows!

"GVE MASTER SYSTEM SPEEDBALL I SPORT SIM I don't want it; here, you can have it. BY VIRGIN .99 THREE WAYS TO PLAY Speedball Il gives you three different styles of play to choose from; Knockout, League or Cup. In Knockout you play a series of Exhibition games against increasingly tough opposition until you lose. The Cup tournament is an elimination competition involving all sixteen teams in the WSL. The League is where the real men compete. You're placed in a fourteen-game season against every team in the league. You begin in Division Two and if you win promotion to the next division you are given a password so that you can continue your progress. Hurtout teams er: The Park Goal! The crowd goes wild. Here's your team good looking bunch, aren't they? CAN YOU MANAGE? Aah! Never mind. In the 21st Century, the big spectator sport is Speedball, a futuristic mix of American Football and our own beloved Soccer. The rules are simple: two teams of nine people battle it out in a massive arena. Hurl the ball around the park and attempt to it into the opposition's goal, while injuring as many of the opposition as possible in the process. If you don't have the ball, don't worry; just break someone's legs and get it off them! It's just pure violence, and it's time to take a swing at it. Speedball Il is one of the all-time classic sports sims and I've never played it until now! Speedball Il has appeared just when Master System software was beginning to look a little worse for wear, but this triumph should get gamers the world over dragging their Master Systems kicking and screaming from the cupboard. Graphically, Speedball II is nothing amazing, with big and bold sprites running around the screen at quite a nippy pace. There's a lack of presence in the sound department too, but the gameplay is excellent. You'll get into Speedball or far easier than you'll get out of it it's just sooo addictive. You'll spend absolutely ages trying to progress to the top of the first division and, once you're there, there's plenty left in the two-player game to keep you occupied for ages. The best sports sim on the Master System Period! PAUL ANGLIN WELL... IT'S A BONUS INNIT As well as controlling the team's playing styles, you also get to lord it over all the boys like a latter-day Bill Shankly. On the manager screen you have the task of preparing the lads for their next match. To bring your team up to scratch, you must buy and sell players, as well as train up your current bunch of thugs. There are eight different attributes for each player. Some, like the Bitmap Shades, are completely useless, but others like the brain boosts (that'd be a good idea for Keen), go a long way to helping out your players on the pitch. There are many ways to tot up your points in Speedball II. A goal is worth ten points, but if you want to win the World Speedball Cup, you'll have to master all the different ways of scoring. Bounce Domes: There are two of these on the field (one at each end) and are worth two points each time you hit them. Stars: These are situated on the walls and act in exactly the same way as the Bounce domes. If you hit all five of the stars you gain a ten point bonus. Score Multiplier Ramp: Now this is how to really score points. If you throw the ball up the ramp you'll activate the score multiplier. Then, each time you score, (including bonus points) your points will increase by 50 per cent. Roll the ball up there a second time and all points will be worth double. Hit the wall for bonus points. You're supposed to chase after the ball, lads. Okay, who's hiding the ball? STRATEGY SKILL CVG % 86 GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 92 GVG 062 ACTION REFLEXES HIT "

"W PREVIEW THE MAN OF STEEL MEGADRIVE MASTER SYSTEM BY VIRGIN TBA GUPERMAN It seemed an ordinary day at the Daily Planet. Clark Kent was doing nothing in Blimey! The man of steel is about to touch down on particular, Jimmy was taking pictures of the water dispensers and, of course, Lois was off chasing a hot exclusive and that was the problem! Lois had Megadrive and master system in his biggest adventure yet: Megadrive and Master System in his biggest adventure yet! Superman has been out of the limelight recently, but Virgin getting concerned, not least of all Sup..I mean Clark. So, come his lunch hour, the man kent dived into the nearest phone booth for are readying themselves to unleash the crimebuster on an some telephonic tomfoolery. Then, out of the seemingly-innocent call-box, came unsuspecting public. The game should be available on import Superman! He knew his love needed rescuing, and there was no time to spare. at any time now, and an official release date is currently being decided on. Read on; this is gonna be big! TOP LEFT: Supes collars another bad guy in one of the may cut-scenes. Superman is split into two different types of game; there's the bog standard platform-based fun, and the flying sections. On the platform levels you can defend yourself by kicking and punching your enemies. You can still fly in these sections, but you'll probably miss most of the things that you were supposed to look for! The real flying stages take place solely in the air and Superman is equipped with laser-beam eyes to deal with his foes. BOTTOM LEFT: Superman meets Cybernator! TOP RIGHT: A great right hook from the man of steel. CENTRE:: Superman gets nobbled by a flying saucer-type thing. Some of you may not recognise all of the bad guys in Superman. That's because, rather than the enemies Supes faced in the movies, he's up against his foes from the original Marvel comic adventures. The comic book Superman has been doing the rounds since the dawn of time, having faced some of the most evil super-villains ever seen, such as Brainiac, Lex Luthor and even the three superbaddies seen in the second of the Superman films; General Zod, Non and whatever the other one was called. Best of all, you even get to give some of these guys a bit of a kicking in the cart! BOTTOM RIGHT:The Underground gets worse and worse! With the release of Superman on both Sega formats, the question everyone is asking (or at least should be) is how different are the two versions? Apart from the obvious graphical differences, there's not been a huge amount of change between the Megadrive and Master System games. The object of your mission is the same; rescue the lovely Lois Lane, who has been hidden on a spacecraft way up in the clouds. Both versions feature flying and platform sections with plenty of death and destruction excellent! So, expect the full review first in CVG soon! POWER ENEMY S.CO RIE 12000 HEATI PUNCH 5. CVG ENEM "

"CHEAT MODE uper Mario Kart has quickly become a real office hit, with everyone queuing up to smash sad Rand off the face of the earth. There has been much cussing as the boys battle it out for supremacy on the tracks. Well thankfully you don't have to go through all this malarkey, 'cos fresh from causing mayhem on the roads of Canvey Island is that young fop, Paul Anglin, with part one of the complete guide to Nintendo's latest and greatest racer. Take it away, Angers! FAVE RACERS OF THE BOYS Everybody has their faves and here's ours: SLIP SLIDING AWAY Paul When you see what looks like a load of grit on one of the bends on the track, this denotes a skid pan. These are very slippery, so you should try to take the corners wide to try and avoid them, or if you have to go through them, tap the joypad round rather than do the corner all in one go. Koopa's the greatest in my books 'cos he's dead fast and has big eyes so he can see old people on Zebra crossings unlike me. SUPER MARIO GUIDE Overall  Bowser Luigi Toad Princess Accleration ont Top speed Road holding Road handling, un c conta com o ono come on Located a com o com o con Extra Info Probably the best all round Karter in the world. Only for people who don't crash ever! Too average to bother with. Second only to the great Koopa. Very nippy, but she doesn't grip the road too well for a thin lass. No abilities to set him apart from the rest. Fat boy's worth using if you're patient. Pretty fiddly to control. THE PERFECT START Mario Donkey Yoshi Come on M The best way to move up the field quickly on Mario Kart is to get off to a flying start, and there is a way to get a real fast one. Here's how to do it: The secret is to press your accelerator sometime after the first light goes, and just as the second one lights. The exact time is different for all the racers so you'll have to practice it, but t shouldn't take you long. GVG 070 "


"CHEAT MODE 00000 Garth Princess Toadstool is a real babe. She's fast, slinky and has lovely long hair even though it's not as long or lovely as mine. Rand Donkey Kong does it for me as he has unlimited Paunch power. Paunch power, paunch power. Steve I think Yoshi's great, me \"cos he has real firey breath jut like me when I wake up in the morning. Jon Toad's top boy 'cos his huge head wobbles all over the place when he turns. I have a large head and I wobble a lot when I walk as well. Jenny Bowser's just dreamy 'cos he wears these big studded things round his wrists and he's just one big stud just like Jon really JUMP YOU FOOL JUMP HE'S BEHIND YOU From time to time yellow strips will appear on the track. These are jump bars. Simply drive over these and your Kart will jump into the air. How high depends on what your jumping over. If there is something you want to pick up on the other side of the jump bar, but you can't because you keep jumping it, simply use one of your little jumps to clear the jump bar. It's split-screen action for two players, but if you're playing in one player mode, the bottom half of the screen is a map of the track with all the racers on it. If you tire of this simply press select and the bottom screen will be turned into a rear view mirror. This can be very handy when placing banana skins on the track, as 100° 13°05 you can see exactly where your opponents are in relation to you. The map is also very handy for checking up on what is coming up next. The best solution is to stay on the map screen, but switch to the rear view when you need to dump a banana skin or some other weapon. SPEED DEMON C&C SPEED FACTORY When you see a yellow arrow appear on the track, make sure you head for it, because they are speed ups. These can prove critical in races, as they give as much speed as a Mushroom. When you begin the game, you're given the choice of 50 or 100cc races to compete in. When you eventually win the gold in every league on 100cc, you will then be able to move up into the real games players league, and race at 150cc. Wait there's more, come first in every leagueon 23 100CLASS 150cc, and AO you'll get MUSHROOM CUP PACE another league to race in and FLOWER CUP RACE that's for the STAR CUP PACE CVG boys only. SPECIAL QUP RALE * * &000 MR. MOLE When you start to get into the big, boys league of Mario Kart, you'd better get ready to encounter the dreaded moles. The easiest way to deal with these critters is to try and drive around their holes, but if one attacks you the only way to get rid of it, (unless you have a weapon) is to use you small jumps which as you should know, are operated by using your Land R buttons.

Well the only thing that I can think of is that Palace Five is easier with the Red staff which can only be obtained by going through Palace Six first. Dear Paul, I've completed Dracula on the Lynx but I can't seem to get an end sequence. Is there something I should have collected that I missed or what? Ben Williams, Adelaide, Australia. GVG 075 "

"AUTE HOTSHOTS KING ARTHUR'S WORLD SNES BY JALECO . .99 ing Arthur's looking for new followers to join his crusade, presumably because the previous lot trotted out for a big knight out and haven't returned yet! The dozy king needs archers, swordsmen, engineers and foot-soldiers as well as specialists in explosives and magic. King Arthur's World boasts 23 levels and three different realms combining incredible strategy and action with some great 3D graphics. The game's in the mould of Lemmings, with you picking followers to perform specific tasks and thus progress through the game. In addition to the scores of puzzles, there are some disgusting enemies to contend with, including ogres, trolls, goblins and demons, each of which must be faced in hand-to-hand combat. Jaleco's cart is the first to include Dolby Surround Sound, which can be enjoyed by anyone with compatible stereo equipment for brilliant sound effects that echo and swarm around your bedroom! Look out for this one in the next issue of CVG. If you thought this looked like Lemmings, you'd be, erm, right! King Arthur's World seems like fun, though. WALKER AMIGA  BY PSYGNOSIS  .99 Hut, hut hut hut hut, huurt CAPTAIN AMERICA et behind the controls of a thirty-foot tall metallic killing machine with Psyg BORING Shield Non nosis' latest mammoth creation, Walker AG-9. The massive mechanoid resembles something straight out of a Robocop movie or a mutated Star Wars flick! The aim of the game is to travel through time and wipe out your technically inferior enemies before they have a chance of smacking you about in the future. You'll be travelling through four different time zones, coming up against a horde of different military equipment that must be riddled with bullets and destroyed so that in the future it doesn't get the chance to do you in. The Amiga graphics look great; the scale of the towering Walker is kept realistic by the size of the tiny tanks, helicopters and other armaments that constantly come toward you. There are even groups of tiny soldiers, who try to lasso your pod before climbing up the outside and blasting it to bits! Looks great fun and we'll have a full review for you in the very next ish! AND THE AVENGERS MEGA DRIVE BY DATA EAST  .99 he dreaded Red Skull is using a mind-control device to unite the world's most evil super-villains and place them under his command! Can you foil the Skull's fiendish plans for world domination? Find out with Data East's newest venture into Marvel territory. Captain America and The Avengers is a direct conversion of the multi-player coin-op. You can control any one of the heroes Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye and Vision and you don't have to take on Red Skull alone as you can drag in a buddy to play alongside for double arcade battling! The four characters are thrown into a whole host of different scenarios and pitted against more villains than Sherlock Holmes at a kleptomaniacs' annual convention! All the super-dudes have their own attack methods and characteristics, so pick whichever one you fancy. The game will be available for all Marvel fanatics in April and we'll tell you all about it soon! Big and bad. If you're in a AG-9, you never have to say sorry! Temp Nomina GVG 080 "
