Or will they be all hoity-toity, stick their noses in the air and say \"We paid enough for the machine, so why buy budget?\" Let's hope the move works, for it may begin to bring prices down across the board.

Then came the whirring of a distant fax machine, churning out news from Japan which came as quite a shock specifications and diagrams of the PC Engine II!! Unfortunately most of the text was in Japanese, but we did find out that the machine's central processor will run at a staggering 16 Mhz so it has about three times the processing power of the original PC Engine. We're having the text translated as you read this, so if you want the whole story, read next month's issue. HEWSON' CHRISTMAS BOXES Hewson are all set for the run-in to Chrimbo with an impressive list of new titles. Ones to watch out for are The Christmas Collection, an 8 bit compilation of a huge range of top games including Uridium, Cybernoid II, Sanxion (64 only) and Hydrofool (Spectrum only). At .99, The Christmas Collection represents superb value for money and a break for mums and dads while Wizard of Oz is on again. Keep an eye out too for the followup to hit game Nebulus. With the imaginative title of Nebulus II, Pogo the Green, Bouncy Thing bounds his way through sixteen towers of hassle including slides, teleports, collapsing ports and swinging ropes. But perhaps the most exciting prospect is the post-January sales release of Paradroid on the 16 bits. With gameplay designed with the ST and Amiga in mind, as well as a huge graphic and sound overhaul, Andrew Braybrook, the game's programmer, expects big things from Paradroid.

Whatever it is, it's called the (take a deep breath) Spectravideo Quickshot QS 129 Flight Controller (breathe normally again) and it's been described as \"the controller for the 1990's\" (by Spectravideo, conspicuously). It certainly looks a bit swish, perhaps taking just a hint of an idea from Konix's Multisystem controller, Spectravideo reckon that it will \"enable the player to almost forget it is there and appear to play his favourite arcade games by thought alone.\" The Flight Controller will retail at .50, with their old faithful Quickshot II Turbo dropping to .50.

VALUE Here, we take into consider ation the price of the game, the amount of entertainment it of fers and the quality of the packaging. In other words Is it worth the money.

As in the arcade game, you get a choice of drivers and five sets of five courses to drive. After making your selections, you're shown the first track spinning around in 3D, then you zoom up behind your racer who's revving up on the start line.

Earlier this year, the game wowing the crowds was Power Drift, an exhilarating buggy race over 25 tracks which are like tarmac roller coasters. Activision saw the potential kilobucks that home conversions of this mega machine could earn and quickly signed up the licence, much to the derision of a sceptical press. They're hoping this will be the Christmas number one, and I'm happy to report that their faith isn't as misplaced as everyone thought it would be.

Taito's coin-op was originally meant to be called Continental Circuits, but wires got crossed and the translation came out as \"Circus\"! Strange, but true! Anyway, the \"circuits\" in question are a series of eight tracks set around the world: Brazil, America, France, Monaco, Germany, Spain, Mexico and Japan. Each has their own hazards, and some are more difficult than others; Monaco, for example, is almost entirely made up of bends and chicanes, whereas Japan is full of lovely long straights. On every track you've got to race your way through the field to achieve a qualifying position. At Brazil you start off in 100th place and have to make your way to 80th; by Japan you've got to finish in the top three. Each course also has a strict time limit: crash once and you'll be lucky to finish. If you hit other cars or roadside obstacles, you set your vehicle alight, and it's time to enter the pits, where the clock is stopped until you're fully repaired. If you don't make a pit stop. you'll eventually blow up, spin off the track and lose valuable seconds. Although the original coin-op is an enjoyable game, the 8 bit versions have failed to capitalise on the machine's fast action, and the end results are rather rouCURRENT-RAN ...

The player takes the role of Ham Burger, who has recently inherited 555 Rue Morgue from his uncle, Cheez Burger, who died in a horrific accident in the cellar there; having just taken up residence, he soon discovers some disturbing things about the place and it's not just the spiders! However, the resident ghosts turn out to be quite a friendly crowd, and Ham soon decides to join them in an effort to eliminate the feared and hated Ooze. Ooze is a text adventure, with a graphics system almost identical to that pioneered by Magnetic Scrolls. This means it's not only a little dated for a new release, but being so obviously similar, it invites comparison and basically, the graphics are nowhere near as good. On the plus side, there's lively title music, and plenty of decent sound effects, including eerie laughs, creaks, and bumps. In a text adventure, not surprisingly, it is the text output that makes the game. There is plenty of it, but on the Amiga version I played, 80 column white text on a black background, with no alternative size is a difficult read if you're using a TV.

In this game, you lift off in your whirlybird and scroll around an underground base, blasting missile silos and alien attack waves, and picking up fuel drums and the odd extra gun. Knock out the enemy completely and you get to play \"Catch The Missile\" with their secret weapon. Getting that far is another matter, though, because all three versions are very tough.

"REVIEW TIIMIIMM PC BY MICROPROSE After putting you at the controls of every other bit of military hardware in the American armed forces. Microprose have finally applied their computer simulation technology to a tank, namely the US Army's MI Abrams. Not surprisingly for a Microprose game, this Abrams is stationed somewhere along the Eastern front, waiting for the Red Army to rampage over the hill (exactly where, and against which part of the Red Army is decided by your choice of mission difficulty) Unlike some of Microprose's other games, playing Tank isn't just a matter of whizzing about popping off cannon rounds at anything that trundles past. MI The platoon forms a column on the road east. The gunner's view. Don't shoot him he's on your side! Tank Platoon is a much more thoughtful game than, say, F-15 Strike Eagle II, and consequently the gameplay is about 40% action to 60% strategy. For a start you command a platoon of four tanks, which have to interact with friendly gunnery, other tank platoons and reconnaissance helicopters.

"COIN-OP Las Vegas! A city of 750,000 people stuck in the middle of a desert, surrounded by mountains, sand, sand and more sand. Americans go there to gamble, C+VG flew out to visit one of the worlds largest video game exhibitions, the AMOA Show held at the Hilton Pavillion. John Cook has the story. Every kind of amusement machine operator and manufacturer was there, from multi-national giants like Sega, to a one-man band who was trying to promote a video game you controlled... by standing on a wired-up surf board! Extra realism could be obtained by having a mate throw buckets of salt water over you during the proceedings. Interesting stuff or what? But it's big business, this coin-operated stuff, y'know. How much get dumped in the coin slots of the USA every year? An estimated seven billion dollars or around 4.5 billion pounds. that's how much. Video games and pinball take up about $5.5 billion of that, which equates to about, say 15 billion goes, which equals about 60 games per year for every man, woman, wombat and child in America. Golly no wonder some of the exhibitors looked so serious laughing hysterically. Ho hum! Sega was also showing an utterly wonderful golf game based on the System 24 cabinet. Called World Masters Golf, this is certainly the best of the hundreds of golf games that seemed to litter the exhibition. Watch the home rights to this get positively eaten up! I've a feeling that Sega were saving something really special up for the show to be held in Tokyo in a couple of weeks watch this space for more details. Another Japanese manufacturer that was probably keeping something back was Capcom. With UN Squadron, the latest release on show, along with virtually every other CP System game, there was a bit of a lack of excitement. Boring, boring specifically as UN Squadron is barely as stimulating and inviting as slipping into a fiveyear coma. thing that could make it better was to link the machines together. Someone must have been listening, SMGP machines can now be linked together up to 8 of them and you race against each other! Wow maaaannnl C+VG hereby announce multi-player SMGP as the most wonderful group sensory experience since Crystal Palace last won at home. It's the same game essentially, of course, with you first qualifying for a position on the grid, then racing around the full Monaco circuit. But this time you have other human beings who, being other human beings, tend to pull nutter-like stunts such as standi ng on the brakes when you are right up behind them. Blam! You're written off, they go along their own sweet way, ON SHIN KAZANA POR MIGRENSINON LOS SEGA WHOPPA Most serious of all about the coin op business has to be Sega and they had several acres of space on the show floor, mostly devoted to a new slant to Super Monaco Grand Prix. Didn't we say that SMGP was fab and the only Super Monaco GP BORDE 100 "


"CITY UCNTS BOIS BONUS ATARI STUNNA Atari Games were on home ground, however, and pulling out all the stops with a brand new 3D polygon game called STUN Runner. This one has you flying a Speeder along 3D tunnels, roller coasters and starscapes. Faster than any other 3D poly game around, it's a real treat to get you hands on. Expect a full review herein jolly soon. Lesser games on shows by them were Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters and a new version of Cyberball 'cos the poor old American consumers found the first one a bit too complicated. Namco were nicking a bit of the Atari stand showing off Four Trax (see the review this issue) with double units linked together. Fun game. There was what might be called a Tetris variant on show at the American Technos stand, called Block Out. Simply enough, it's a full 3D kind of Tetris game, with you looking down from the top of the cube and able to rotate the shapes in the x, y and z axies. Probably the most innovative game of the show, which unexpectedly had the hardened operators queuing up to play www GR SHOOT DEAD HEADS Whatever has happened to Taito? Has it gone bonkers?

"COIN-OP CITY gested the better things are on the way. Like follow ups to certain amazingly successful driving games. Can't wait to play them. Jaleco has always been a bit of a low-key company but have moved up this year with Big Run. A rally driving game again you can link 'em up to each other it looked fun, if a tad unoriginal. X-TYPE One of our favourite smaller companies is Irem. It's been producing a series of unspectacular but very playable PCB's, the last of which was Dragon Breed. Now there's an even better one called X-Multiply. OK, so it's horizontal scroller. A cruel type could even claim it was a Nemesis variant. But it's incredibly addictive and will have you whopping the dosh down the coin slot faster than the treasury can keep up. Other highlights? Data East had a newie called Midnight Resistance which looks like fun and in the \"how the hell can they get that many sprites moving on a screen, even though they are a bit on the small side\" dept, Task Force Harrier (produced by the same guys who did Omega Fighter) was jolly good. And Konami's SPY revealed a pleasant surprise-a section with a different perspective than the first few screens and better playability. PC ENGINE COINOP The big surprise stuff, though, was how the PC Engine has turned up inside a normal coin-op cabinet! Change the game, all you have to do is slot in a new data cartridge price $200, compared to $800 for a game board using normal technology and you've got an arcade machine.

New adventures currently scheduled for release between now and April include Manhunter San Francisco, Leisure Suit Larry 3, Hero's Quest, Conquest Of Camelot, Ice Man, and The Colonel's Bequest. Of the three formats to be released in the UK IBM, ST, and Amiga only the IBM and ST versions are all scheduled for this side of April.
