Despite an attempt on his life by beautiful Czech Cellist Kara, Koskov is eventually brought safely to London. Unfortunately Koskov is abducted by Necros, a ruthless killer. M, Bond's boss, suspecting the KGB, sends Bond to serve a terminatinon warrant on General Pushkin, who is known to be in Tangiers with a trade Delegation. Before doing this, Bond decides to return to Bratislava to try to get closer to Kara. He does this and discovers Kara is an innocent victim of the Russian General. He also learns of Koskov's involvement with International Arms Dealer Brad Whitaker. In true 007 style, Kara is rescued and taken to Vienna where she succumbs to the Bond charm. Together with Kara, Bond moves to Tangiers where he eventually confronts General Pushkin in his Hotel. They plan together to trap Koskov and Whitaker. Bond and Kara are taken prisoners by Koskov and flown to Russian occupied Afghanistan, but it is not long before Bond breaks free with Kara and Kamran Shah, the leader of a group of Afghjan freedom fighters. Together they find out what Koskov and Whitaker are up to smuggling raw opium. It is obvious they must be stopped, so the support of Kamran's rebel group they overcome masses of Koskov's troops and allies in an attempt to prevent the Opium leaving the country.

Mr Crowther has been author to a fair number of good games, but it seems he may have lot his touch... Gobots is not what I'd call a Crowther classic. It lacks the pulling power, graphical quality and other Crowtherish features which made Suicide Express, Potty Pigeon and Trap such great games. The Gobots are machines which can transform themselves into various types of vehicle at the drop of a hat. Each one has his/her (what sex is a robot?) own type of vehicle, be it plane, tank or scooter. Most of you probably know this already, because these character have their own Gobots' human friends, and cartoon series, which I must when they come looking for confess I haven't actually seen. them, he will zap them with his The plot of his caper, entitled new bases. 'The Moebius Strip', is all about Having sent two evil an evil Prof. who plans to henchmen out to get the destroy the Gobots once and for humans, they return to their all. His plan is to capture the master with an extra gift, the powerful Gobot called Turbo who is, for the present time, out cold. Well, to cut a very long and extremely tedious story short, the Gobots come to rescue their buddies. One gets captured and turned against his pals, and another discovers that he has the power to produce clones of himself. Using this new found and amazingly handy skill, Leader One comes up with a plan, which goes something like this: Step one: Drop a clone into the nearest base. Step two: Watch it explode. Step three: If there are no humans around, repeat procedure if there are, pick 'em up! This is where you actually, at last, enter the game. Using your joystick to manoeuvre a very wobbily Leader One, you must scoop up the Scooter clones and attempt to drop them into the nearest base. But, needless to say, it's not that easy. Whilst you're attempting to demolish the base, attacking baddy Gobots, called Cop-ters, or something like that, will try to stop you by crashing into you. Flying your Gobot around is really no easy task in itself, as the controls are far too sensitive, and I found myself constantly crashing into the planet. You may also land on the surface of the planet, and there you can dig large rocks which, if you are in the mood, can be thrown at oncoming traffic.

Bubbler looks nice, sounds intriguing and is certainly challenging Quite honestly I'm at a loss. Mystified. Confused. Stumped. How the hell do you get off the first screen of this game? Since the latest offering from the tight-lipped mystery men from Ashby de la Zouch arrived in the office, I've kept returning to it every few days. And I get absolutely nowhere. I've watched other people try to play it. And guess what? I've still not seen anything other then the opening screen. There a whole new game lurking in my computer but! can't find it. So this \"review\" will tell you the game's about and what happens on the first screen. The evil wizard Vadra controls the ancient city of Irkon. The inhabitants have been imprisoned and you have been turned into a blob. Huge bottles have been constructed which ozze bubbles which turn into strange mutant creatures. Hence the title Bubbler. But life's not all bad for you as a blob. You can move and spit fire globules at your foe. Around the city are magic corks, hidden under trapdoors. Find all these corks, to bung in the bubblers and Vadra's powers will be ended. The game is as far as I can judge like Marble Madness Bubbler OON  GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY and Spindizzy to look at, all ramps, causeways and platforms over which you must guide the blob. The starting point of the game is a platform with what appear to be two exit ramps, up which you must travel to exit the location. The trouble was that I just couldn't get any control over the blob. It seemed to have a mind of its own and a sense of direction which kept taking it off the platform and into the black void beneath. Losing lives as quick as I did meant Game Over coming up with tedious regularity. I did actually manage to get halfway up each ramp but just couldn't make it to the top. Very frustrating.

In fact it was tough enough to get the C+VG team away from the machine. No-one will be rushing to play the Spectrum version of the game. The best thing I can say is that I hope the 64 and Amstrad versions are better. Quartet was Sega's bid to catch up with Atari in the multiplayer game stakes which began with Gauntlet. Of course, you can't hope to get four players gathered round a Spectrum but you can get two. Even with a friend playing along with you it's hard to capture any of the excitment generated by the arcade machine.

You lose items when you've killed and if you die and lose the axe you might as well forget about continuing. It's a vital bit of equipment and you just won't be able to go beyond the first territory without it. There's a frog who needs a good hammering before he gets out of your way near the end. This makes the game frustrating it's no challenge if you lose a life early on and KNOW you just can't get any a skateboard or a fairy who may protect you for a while. Do not forget to boost your strength and collect bonus points by eating exotic fruit or junk food. At the top left of the screen the number or lives remaining is shown. Just beneath this there is a box which wil display the stone axe when you have picked it up. Immediately to the right of the box are three icons representing the first three lands; upon completing a land the icon for that land will light When the last of the three icons is lit, they will scroll off revealing a new land to be completed Mid-way at the top of the screen your score and the highest score achieved are shown.

"K+VG Uranians unk MACHINE: BBC/ELECTRON SUPPLIER: BUG-BYTE PRICE: $2.99  VERSION TESTED: BBC  REVIEWER: NICKY  MACHINE: BBC/ELECTRON SUPPLIER: BUG-BYTE  PRICE: .99  VERSION TESTED: BBC REVIEWER: NICKY You view your ship from above and the ground scrolls down the screen below you. The trick is to negotiate your way round the hectic airspace, with your finger firmly on the firing button. You can use keyboard or joystick, but whichever you choose your trigger finger will suffer. Fortunately you can give it a rest by using the auto fire facility. Firetrack may be nothing new, but it's an excellent variation on a tried and trusted theme. The game was created by Orlando, so it's no surprise that the graphics are smooth, fast and colourful. There are plenty of different scenarios to add interest. And watch out, it's addictive. Your nerves will be in tatters after a few games. If you like you action fast and furious, with a dash of variety, add Firetrack to your collection without more If you like budget shoot-'emups, this is for you. Otherwise forget it. There's not much to this game a pretty basic screen scenario, a lot of aliens to zap, and that's it. Basically, there are all these aliens coming to attack your base. Four different types of them, to be exact. They drop a lot of bombs and are prone to vanish unexpectedly. You scurry left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing your laser up at them. There are only three keys to worry about -right, left and fire. Complications and there aren't many — include satellites, which suddenly appear and drop bombs. And the alien mothership is prone to release smart bombs which more or less paralyse you for several seconds It's a pretty average game. The main thing it has going for it is speed--it's very fast. But there are several irritations. First, it is one of those unwieldly programs which load in several sections, which means you can't go away and make some tea while it's going on. Second, and more serious, it's liable to crash in such a way that you have to reload from scratch if you want to continue. Frankly, I have seen better. As climbing-around-the-screen type games go, this is tolerable. Particularly if you don't like spending a lot of money. It's familiar stuff. You control Dave the Dungaroid in his attempt to escape from prison in which there seems to be just one prisoner (him) and a host of aliens. So off you go, clambering around 20 screens, jumping between platforms, using lifts nifty with smooth animation. and so on.

It's those MAD spies again, turning the arctic into a snow go area for espionage. If my memory serves me well this is the third of the Spy vs Spy games and Artic Antics is more of the same. Databyte has certainly taken its time bringing this one out but, judging from the response of our recent Spy vs Spy competition, there's still a great amount of interest in it. Once again it's the white spy versus the black spy in a mission to be the first into outer space. The race is on for each spy to collect a space helmet, navigation chart, uranium cube and the \"master carrier\" before entering the rocket for blast off. As before the spys move around they brave blizzard, bears, penguins, can indulge in snowball fights, deadly icicles etc. Each spy can lay traps for the other such as sawing holes in the ice, making ice-patches and even blowing your opponent up. Running along the bottom of each screen is the \"trapulator\" which displays the items eacy spy has managed to collect. The screen display on my instruction sheet included an icon for snowballs. As with the others, it's playable, and great fun. I spy another winner. Feeling murderous? Like to go out there and blast away at everything in sight? You'll love Firetrack. Yes, it's another zipping through space/guns blazing/ tally-ho shoot-'em-up, with the usual feeble plot to justify the mayhem. It seems you're a 22nd century space pilot caught up in the pirate wars, and your job is to destroy the colonies of the 'Pirate Industrials'. You've also got to find a mysterious White Light before the baddies do. In other words, you go out there and blast everything in sight.

"TEE-SCANNER RETIVE! MACHINES: AMSTRAD/ COMMODORE/SPECTRUM SUPPLIER: GREMLIN PRICE: .99  VERSIONS TESTED: SPECTRUMJAMSTRAD REVIEWER: JOHN DC-DSMENZD Trio Hit-pak L»Te 0:00 tot time 10:00. Intergalactic kidnapping is suddenly big business, but there seems to be no rhyme or reason for it, except to populate the ominous Matrix prisons owned by the Cratons. The latest victims are harmless mechanical race called the Bioptons who, despite their request that they be left alone to rust in peace, are not about to scrap their buddies. Fiendish security systems make a rescue attempt impossible by anything other than a lone Biopton. Nimrod is chosen by the Biopton Govenment, given a space ship and told to land on each section of the Matrix planetary network, overcome the security devices and rescue hostages. There are a seemingly infinite number of matrix prisons on which to land and a limited amount of time99 minutes before the hostages are executed. You're first given the opportunity to select a matrix level by scanning a cursor across a star map on yor space ship's veiwer. Pressing fire when you are over one of these level takes you down to a landing sight to which you'll return with your hostages or if you want to get back to your ship for any other reason, such as your energy's running low. Nimrod is lightly armed when he enters a complex but he'll need to find other weaponry, such as the Lazatron, Megabolt and Megatron if he's to deal with the monsters and traps the Cratons have left for intruders. The guards are the most obvious of his worries and, if his firepower is low, it's best to be out of any situation which involves them. The ground is laden with energy distruptors, spikey mines, floor pad operated doors, black ice, rebound and energy loss squares. Rebound squares are particularly dangerous if arranged in a semi-square. Once you're in its arms it takes a lot of force to break free of the magnetic push and pull. As for the black ice, I'm not sure whether you fall through into the depths of the prison or into a black hole. Cratons are unusual captors; they've included elements in their prisons which'll help potential rescuers.

A final word of warningMACHINES: SPECTRUM/ AMSTRAD/CBM 64 SUPPLER: ELITE PRICE: .95 CASSETTE/E14.95 DISK  VERSIONS TESTED: SPECTRUM/AMSTRAD REVIEWER: PAUL Things have been a little quiet on the games from at Elite recently, no doubt gearing up for the Christmas blitz. But the Walsall boys have found time to put out three excellent compilation tapes for not an excessive amount of dosh. The Trio Hit Pak— Trio sounds a bit like a chocolate bar to meis available across the three main formats with most of the games common to each. This is what you get: Spectrum and Amstrad Great Gurianos, Airwolf Two and 3DC. Commodore 64 Great Gurianos, Airwolf Two and Cataball. Great Gurianos is the old Taito coin op game and for me it's the best of the bunch. Hack and slash with nice big cartoon graphics. I'm much too young to remember Elite's original Airwolf game based on the adventures of TV helicopter pilot Stringfellow Hawke (what a dumb name). 3DC is a 3D arcade adventure set underwater in which a diver must reconstruct a submarine while fighting off deep sea nasties. Cataball is a bit odd. You control four bounding balls, which move in a wave-like motion, against a series of backdrops in an effort to collect ballons. Strange but playable. Great Gurianos gets my top vote but when you add three other good playable games. Spectrum/Amstrad GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY Reus T just load up and take it away.

"The Final m REVIEWS atrix Grand prix MACHINES: BBC/MASTER SUPPLIER: SUPERIOR PRICE: .95 (DISK) VERSION TESTED: BBC REVIEWER: NICKY DEVICE HELD Ammo TARE Grand Prix is a motor racing game that lets you design your own race circuits, although you also have 18 pre-defined race tracks including Brands Hatch and Monaco. It reminded me of Atari's Pole Position, since the layout of the screen as seen by the driver is very similar. But with Grand Prix you get a lot more extras. You've got the choice of playing against a mate or the computer. The computer, might say, has taken good care to give itself the advantage of a faster car, which of course never crashes. So you've got to be good to keep up. One neat touch is the way each driver has his or her own separate view on the screen, which adds to the realism. Controlling the car is straightforward enough. You have keys for accelerate, brake, and right although joystick would probably be a better bet. You can't take corners too fast, and watch out for the humpback bridges if you're too fast you'll blow up. The 'radar' at the bottom of the screen tells you where you are and warns you about bends and bridges. Sound, colour and graphics are all good, with smooth animation. All in all, Grand Prix is a good bet for all those armchair Nigel Mansells. ENERGY LARTEON which is more than Nimrod got from his government. Be careful when you jump onto the wall tops of the prison. Each level is split into several large sections with black space in between. If you fall into the space it drains your energy and you lose the only life you've SITE got. The Final Matrix is a combination of game concepts put to good use. It's Knightlore, Nexor, Terror of the Deep, and Star Raiders rolled into one and even Nimrod looks similar to the robot in Martianoids. The 3D display is similar to Ultimate, but it's slightly off perspective and scrolls slowly both on the Sepctrum and Amstrad versions. It's still an action packed and frustrating game despite the technical criticism, although still can't work out why the Bioptons were kidnapped in the co first place. Gremlin never tell you but then, I expect they were too busy thinking about the features to worry about gaps in the story line. GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY "

The action takes place in a multichambered electronic dungeon, ranging in appearance from conventional rooms to huge underground caverns.

This is the fourth game produced on essentially the same system by Ken Wright, who has previously used it for his Waterloo, Austerlitz and Napoleon at War. Overall, Yankee is the best of these four games. Sadly, it is still not very good. The thinking behind the games-playing program is in itself a sensible one. The author argues that an Army commander should have little direct control over formations below him in 19th-century warfare. Instead he issues generalised directions to his Corps commanders. The computer makes these commanders \"intelligent\" so that they will query their orders, offer suggestions which from a better viewpoint they consider more likely to succeed, and can even be given full control of their forces when in the presence of the enemy, to act as they think requesting permission to retreat, \"advanced\" level is very difficult and when this was granted indeed) hidden movement, a attacked with half his force time-limit on issuing orders, while the rest moved sideways; changes in the balance of a Corps ordered to attack query forces, the rate of arrival of its orders and say that instead it forces for either side, the wanted to attack (?!); and a ammunition available to either Corps ordered to advance northside, and options to play any of east promptly set off south-west. the three days or the whole The combat mechanism also battle. remains very crude units Such variety gives a simply hack chunks off each handicapping system so that, at other in units of 500 men, with no its most simple, this game could attempt to advance, retreat or be played by just about anyone, respond to what is happening to and at its most difficult it them. presents a real challenge to the The very large random factors expert. which made the earlier games B oth command-and-control so confused have been reduced, and responses to combat have making it at least possible to been very well thought out in judge an attack properly.

There are four basic scenarios the \"meeting engagement\" of equal forces, and the \"defence\" game, in which your battalion will be attacked by about double its number of enemy, are straightforward. But in the \"attack\" and \"pursuit\" options the player commands one battalion on the western side of the map while the computer runs a second battalion moving in parallel with him.

"rame Hey, you're a real bunch of artists! How do we know? Well, just take a look at the latest screen gems from YOU. There's some truly terrific Amstrad screens from none other than Steven Tate from Milton Keynes who sent us a disc full of goodies like the Christians and his epic \"Crushed Coke Can\" is this ART or what? Then we've got Steve's Karate Kid spoof, East Enders. Truly wicked this one. Equally wicked are David Garbett's Metallic Avenger, taken from an early CAVG cover and his rendition of Zombie Dawn, which looks like a night out in his home town of Walsall. Then there's David Sowerby's fine portrait of our macho-man Kailber on his trusty Electron. They said it couldn't be done. Finally, on a musical note on the 64, there's James Robertson's excellent Money or Nothing screen, taken from the Dire Straits video of the sanie name and a couple of other wonder pics which as usual we can't name because we've lost your letters! Big slap on the wrists all round. Still, as Sergeant Pepper says things are getting better all the time 80 we might get it right next time.

After a million long year's evolution the inevitable consequences of genetic engineering has materialised to haunt the galaxies, to terrorise the star systems and the beings that exist upon them. A race of Masters so feared that stories of their awesome powers are legend and the tales of havoc that they commit from the grotesque starship in which they collect galactic specimens, strike fear into the bodies of all inhabitants of planets upon which this Vessel of doom casts its evil shadow. Fear that is in all except one single, savage neoreptilian creature that too has felt the cataclysmic tremors of evolution and exists as the only living example of the one remaining lifeform that has the strength and cunning to resist the domination of the Masters. Motivated by a sub conscious determination to perpetuate its tortuous existence the creature roams the labyrinthed depths of the space station seeking the hidden hibernation chambers in which the last remaining members of its rebellious race lie in suspended animation. There can only be one objective in its miserable existence... the freeing of its companions and the ultimate destruction of the monsterous Masters.

"SUPPLIER: INFOGRAMES  MACHINES: ATARI ST/CBM 64 PRICE: $24.95 (ATARI); .95/ $14.95 CBM CASSETTE / DISK REVIEWER: ATARI (KEITH) / CBM 64 (PAUL) Passengers on the Wind, based on the awardwinning French comic strip by Francois Bourgeon, is reviews PASSENGERS play. For example, in scene one you can confirm:...\" Without explaining how to \"confirm', the instructions continue\" .. When this first search is over, you do not use the graphics section again.\" Now this isn't too clear. Perhaps something went missing in the translation. Keith found this very annoying As a non-adventure player, Paul found the game much more enjoyable. \"Instead of the seemingly impossible problem solving which are the centre of most adventures, Passengers on the Wind involves you in just getting the right sequence of commands. Keith's summing up: \"I consider myself to be very experienced in the operation of computer programs, especially games software, but this one had me beat. Eventually I turned to the complete solution provided for reviewers, but how it was to be implemented remained a complete mystery.\" Paul's verdict: Passengers may not be the traditional type of adventure we're used to but at least it's something new and a pointer to what could happen in the future. ATARI ST CBM 64 VOCABULARYN A N/A ATMOSPHERE PERSONAL VALUE a vast, sweeping adventure set in the 18th century on the eve of the French Revoution, with settings ranging from England, France and Africa. You play the part of a daring, idealistic heroine, a courageous Breton sailor, and a host of other characters. The game starts easily enough, with a large, fullwidth picture, below which is a character window and a text window. I was quite impressed with the excellent graphics and colour, accompanied by music and sound effects. You call up the various characters, get them to speak and, by getting the correct sequence, progress into the adventure. It's the first time we've seen this type of operation and it can be a little confusing. The instruction could have been a little clearer. They read\"...just by confirmation you can access the character you wish to 1. ME. Ser "

"The Big Screen Ward T hat's this — Ward R out of the previews theatre, they Street writing up the made me an offer I couldn't refuse, movies on a monthly basis? so here goes with this month's Well, though it ain't easy to get me releases... Raising Arizona If I tell you that Raising Arizona (15) is about a baby but I'm making it my film of the month, you'll probably think that Ward has finally flipped. Why would anybody want to watch a movie about a small, pink, wind and wetness merchant? Read on! Baby Arizona, one of the Arizona quintuplets, is a special baby. He gets abducted by baby-napper and eternal loser, H.I. McDonnough -failed petty criminal, failed reformed citizen and, finally, failed father. It seems like the only way for H.I. and his wife, Edwina, to have a family is to steal one. From this one wild seed a series of increasingly chaotic events grow. Soon Baby Arizona is the centre of more action than a parent's worst nightmares. These involve two escaped convicts, a sort of criminal Laurel and Hardy, who realise that there could be money in the infant; visiting friends with their hordes of unruly brats; and The Lone Biker of the Apocalypse, a trick. You want to know what a baby's eye view of the world is like? You get it. Or how to rob a band of hillbillies who take your instructions just a little too literally (How can we throw down our guns if you've told us not to move?'). It's one of the most inventive comedies of the year. Coen's last film was cult-classic Blood Simple, which I suspect most people only got to see on video. This is set to get a well-deserved general release. See it and cry like a baby. Tears of laughter, that is! Who was it who said that flying is just falling and forgetting to hit the ground? Just hope that Eric, The Boy Who Could Fly (PG), has learnt that between the rival tin men. But despite a few car-wrecking slapstick antics at the start, it's really a comedy of town to suggest that it might be the characters. scene of a miracle. There's overworked Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss mum, trying to come to terms with take on two singularly unpleasant roles computers at work; bratty but lovable and give the performances of their brother, the Rambo of the sandpit lives. DeVito's Tilley is a slobbish generation; a collection of school failure who can't face reality while bimbos and bullies and the odd Dreyfuss as DD is a calculating sympathetic teacher. smoothie, a snake who thinks nothing But there's also the same freak of seducing Tilley's wife then phoning atmospheric conditions that produce him to crow about it. But the tables pink skies in so many Spielberg films: are turned-'You can keep her.' his the same soaring music that aims r ival snarls. straight for the strings of the heart. As well as the feud there's another Yes, if Eric's surname had been story, the story of the salesmen — the Thomas they could have usd his initials double glazing pests of their day for the film title. This is an attempt to who use every trick in the book to flog create the same sort of gentle, small the ugly aluminium sidings.

While it And when they're not selling they sit doesn't have his masterly touch and is around in diners, discussing crucial rather too long, it contains enough issues such as why there are no woman that's amusing to raise some laughs, in Bonanaza. and the ending, when Eric's flying Director Barry Levinson knows just antics are put to the test, is quite how to let a story slowly take shape, elevating. But pioneers of unmanned observing the eccentricities of this flight face risks, and a greater sense of small group of misfits so that danger could have made this really eventually you start to realise that soar. even tin men have hearts, if you dig In the Wizard of Oz, all the Tin Man deep enough. wanted was a heart.

Director Joel Coen doesn't miss a A The Boy Who Could Fly lesson because he spends much of his time just hanging around... on window ledges, roofs and the like! When 14-year-old Milly moves into the house next door she befriends his strange, mute teenager who everybody believes to be autistic. Slowly a relationship develops between them, but it's not made any easier by the authorities, who think that Eric would be better off in an institution with a nice, tight straight-jacket to wear. So is Eric batty just because he thinks he's a bird? Certainly there's nothing in this ultra ordinary small "


"predecessor appeared on video, convinced that it would turn everyone who saw it into a mindless zombie. I reckon the worst effects of Dead II would be people who spouted dialogue as mindless as the script's! Despite a slight lull after the first frantic half-hour, Evil Dead II is a wacky, tacky, tasteless roller-coaster ride, totally lacking believable characters and common sense. If you've got the stomach for it, see it — it's bloody funny. A Evil Dead II MILLILIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII A White of the Eye 1976 with a boyfriend, Mike. Somehow this shadow from ten years ago still hangs over the relationship. There's something hypnotic about White of the Eye. It uncovers its horrors in a cold, distant, arty fashion, developing a strange power which draws you deeper and deeper until you finally emerge, feeling as if you've been dragged through the dirt. I suspect that some critics will attack it as a sensationalist slasher movie, which it is not. Director Donald Cammell has set out to make a serious study of psychosis and the horrors of serial killing, and in some ways he has succeeded. But the result is a cold and unpleasant experience. It's a relief to turn to A Great Wall (PG), which is unlikely to get a wide release, but turns out to be a minor gem. It tells the simple tale of Chinaman Leo and his family returning from San Francisco, where he earns a living as an executive in a computer firm, to Peking to visit his sister. A similar East-West culture clash featured in Gung Ho which appeared earlier this year. But while that Raimi just throws his cast together in the isolated cabin from the original movie and lets the special effects loose. Every horror cliche is here, from the something nasty in the cellar to the ancient document that will lift the curse -if any of the cast survives long enough. The audience may not last the whole movie either. I reckon that while fifty percent will be reduced to hysterics, the other half will head A White of the Eye straight for the toilets and barricade There's horror of quite another kind themselves in until the assault of in White of the Eye (18). This is the gruesome slapstick satire is over. sort of movie that can even reduce a Of course the protectors of our cinema of hardened reviewers to a morals got all upset when its state of shocked silence. Globe, Arizona is a dull desert town, surrounded by a bleak landscape of open-cast mines. It's here that hi-fi engineer, Paul White, lives with his wife, Joan, and kid, Danielle. But suddenly their peace is shattered when Paul becomes chief suspect in a murder investigation. Could Paul be guilty of these brutal and apparently motiveless mutilations? Even the police don't seem convinced. Slowly the film reveals more about him he's having an affair with a married woman meanwhile a series of flashbacks show how he met Joan as she was passing through the town in Evil Dead II — frighteningly funny! Problem Page Dear Ward Though I love movies our local cinema has closed. What should I do? Deprived Dear Deprived Yes, I know that feeling too. Sometimes I only get to see three previews a day so I need to watch a video. Though your 20\" TV can never replace the big screen, here are some suggestions for home viewing! Budget masters Channel 5 has released another batch of episodes from Gerry Anderson's dassic series Stingray and Thunderbirds. Acting of a less wooden kind is found in volume two of UFO. All these titles cost just $7.99. More vintage TV is to be found in the next four episodes of The Prisoner. Checkmate, featuring the famous game of human chess, and Hammer into Anvil are one tape while It's Your Funeral and A Change of Mind appear on the other. Great value at .99 each. And now that Roger Moore's relinquished his license to kill, there's a chance to catch him in an earlier incarnation as Simon Templar, The Saint, in The Fiction Makers. There's murder afoot in that most elaborate of thrillers, Sleuth, starring octogenarian Larry Oliver and ever popular Michael Caine (afraid he wouldn't get a mention this month, were you?). If you've never caught it before it's well worth .99. Meanwhile Mastertronic is getting in on the budget video act with the Mastervision label, and while the current releases are mainly kiddy cartoons could be useful for keeping a bawling brat quiet when you won't let him use the computer there are some good things in the backlist, such as Creepshow, a selection of Stephen King shockers which contain the truly horrible acting of their author. They also have gory thriller The Exterminator and Chuck Norris in A Force of One. But my video movie of the month is Whoops Apoclypse The Movie, from Virgin. Don't confuse it with the original TV version, which is also available from Channel 5 and is hilarious in its own right. This is the feature film which had a short cinema release earlier this year, and is jampacked with stars. Laugh till the world ends! A A Great Wall managed to be crude, unfunny and patronising to its Japanese characters, A Great Wall is a warm experience which suggested that both worlds have something to learn from each other. It's a sort of oriental Local Hero. One of the most amazing things about the film is that it was actually shot in Peking, and for once you get a picture of how a communist Chinese family lives — not just endless travelogue shots of bikes. But most of the fun comes from the native Chinese reaction to Western culture. In one hilarious scene Leo's teenage son tries to explain the concept of designer clothes to a Chinaman who remains convinced that his Yves Saint Laurent trousers are the colour of 'mouldy beancurd'. If A Great Wall comes to your local art-house, go see it. IIIIIII "

"ST special Gauntlet has probably been the most successeful coin-op licence ever. Now ST owners can treat themselves to a version of this game, remarkably similar to the original, courtesy of US. Gold, Adventuresoft, and two freelance programmers Graham Lilley and Teoman Irmak. Rather than just do a straight review of a game that almost everyone has played in one form or another, we thought it would be interesting to go behind the scenes, and the screen, to see just how you go about converting an arcade mega-hit. So David Bishop, our resident ST maniac, enticed Graham and Teoman down from their native Birmingham to reveal all! all the graphical atmospheric appearance and appeal of the original.\" What help did you get from the owners of the Gaunlet rights, Atari Games? Graham: \"Very little actually. It wasn't as if they gave us source code or even maps to start with. It was more a case of, here's a machine, now go do the conversion! Eventually though, US. Gold managed to get printouts of each level, which we then coded back into our program.\" Did you spend alot of time playing the original arcade machine? What bugs? Teoman: \"Well, there are a number of places where generators overlap, as if they were stacked on top of each other, so ours do too. Also, the heads of various characters are superimposed on generator when they get too close, so the same happens in the ST version.\" What changes did you have to make from the original? Teoman: \"The coin-op uses thirty-two colours and we only had sixteen, five of which were used for the floors, and 11 for the walls and characters.

Well the first batch of Atarisoft ST releases has hit the streets and, predictably, they contain a number of veteran titles, including Joust, Star Raiders, and that highly addictive evergreen Crystal Castles. If you've been orbiting the earth in Intell-sat or pot-holing in Cheddar Gorge for the last three years, you could be forgiven for never having heard of Crystal Castles. So, for astronauts and cavers everywhere, here goes! You play Bentley Bear as he tries to escape the endless maze of alleys, lifts, and stairways that make up the Crystal Castles. The only good thing about these castles is that they're enchanted, being covered with glistening gems and, even more exciting for a hungry bear, large pots of honey! Not surprisingly, Bentley is being chased by various gem guardians including crystal balls, nasty trees, gem eaters, ghosts, skeletons, swarms of bees (really after the honey but you'll do), and worst of all the evil witch Bethilda with her deadly steaming cauldron, just big enough to make broiled bear. Before Bentley can escape, he must pick up every gem in each of the 37 castles in the game. This he does by running over them rather like in a 3D version of Pacman! The first nine levels each contain four castles. The final castle, level ten, is the most hairy one of them all. Luckily, strategically placed 'warp doors' mercifully let you skip levels. Bentley can be controlled with either Andromeda Software, and joystick or mouse (the an excellent job they've original coin-op used a done of it too. It has track-ball), and pressing excellent sound effects, fire allows you to jump any sprite animation, choice nasties that may be after and use of colours, and all your hide.

Sad ST Arkanoid for example because one is left with possibly the most the impression that the perfect conversion ever. programmers have been Then there are those that, less than diligent in their due to technical attempts to recreate the colour, gameplay, and the generally frenetic atmosphere responsible for the original Xevious success. The main offenders are airborne targets and bullets that are insipid in colour and therefore difficult to see against a rather disappointing background. Also, why discriminate against people who prefer the mouse? It would have taken no time at all to include a mouse control option making use of both the buttons, one for shooting, the other for bombing. Although fun to play for a while, Xevious is an altogether rather flat experience, lacking the punch and addictive qualities of the original game.

After all, the Spectrum had been around three years before Knightlore stunned us all. Airball has appeared a little more than a year after the launch of the ST.

Both methods are effective but remember, after every level is completed and coloured in, a bonus of 7000 points awarded. Take into account the fact that it is much easier to collect a colour on a lower level number. Level one is easier than level four etc. If you complete level two and three first, using level one to collect the red droplets and then complete level one you will zap straight onto levels four, five and six. If there are only one or two aliens left in the attack wave, don't despair, scour the landscape until they appear. They are probably just frightened. The only upwards entrance from level two to three is on the extreme left of the level. Note the arrows in the landscape carefully. If you don't need a colour, go for it anyway. It could come in very handy later. Don't let the police scare you. Keep your cool. The rocks on the bonus screen cannot be killed, just parry. Take it easy at first. Remember you cannot control the Wizball's movement in the air until you have selected the first icon. Practice getting different levels of spin on the Wizball. It is possible to get 12 different spins on the ball, varying from slight to hard. The first icons to select are the two movement controls, otherwise you will find the rest of the game a little tricky. Also select the movement controls as your first two permanent weapons in the Wizlab. Remember Catelites are expendable. A cat has nine lives and is replacable when finally killed. Always sacrifice a cat life as opposed to the life of Wizball. The cat should be used to attack and the Wizball to navigate and keep out of trouble.

Thave been waggling away at the latest Jeff Minter C64 game, Revenge of the Mutant Camels Two. No prizes for guessing that it is a sequel to his first great hit Revenge of the Mutant Camels. The theme is a tried and tested one, shoot things that *move.  You control a camel which has to cross a hundred zones, and each zone has a set distance and its own very personal type of alien just waiting to lunge at your swishing tail. This game is a real extension of the original, with better graphics, sounds, fast death dealing aliens and a mix of cover and a set amount of strategy by including weapon energy which goes down with purchases. each alien attack on you. The The title page has a camel camel can walk across the strolling along to a rather screen, leap into the air and sit soothing traditional Peruvian whilst spewing out bullets and tune (arranged by Ben bombs.

On entry to the game There is a phased ground your camel has seven kms to scroll and a detailed multithe screen to destroy them, that is my kinda bullet!!!), Reset KM:6 BEASTS: energy to max and an extra beasty life. These all cost credits and when you buy one its price is increased so buy wisely and do not waste credits. Some of the original attack waves are in there again (only better) and your ability to access a wave is limited by a 'door selection' type system. You can only go into a wave that is next to you on the grid map. This game had me hooked, the futher I went into it the less wanted to put it down. Some waves are wicked and some are easy so a map is in order. Revenge Two is not a game colour backdrop. for those with weak bladders When the distance counter it flies along at a fantastic hits zero you are then faced speed and you have to try and with a ten by ten map and a keep cool and take in what is shopping list of armaments. coming at you and from The weapons available are where.
