Certainly after a few tubes of sherbert, he's the last guy left standing while everyone else is crawling about the floor. That's not to say Steve excludes himself completely from unruly behaviour. If anything he's more of a threat because he remains so precise. Which probably has a lot to do with why Steve, Tom, some guy named Rad, and ex-CVG superstar Claire almost got thrown out of the Football Football diner for throwing paper aeroplanes.

"TER computer video games NEWS KONAMI  (C) 1997 KONAMI ALL RIGHTS RESE KONAMI FINALLY UNVEIL COBRA ARCADE BOARD! hey've billed it as their answer to Sega's Model 3 board. And after much talk about its games beating the likes of Scud Race in looks, everyone's been dying to see it in action. So finally, Konami have revealed their stateof-the-art Cobra technology. NEW KONAMI COIN-OP HARDWARE LAUNCHED! On Tuesday 17th June, Konami unveiled it's fantastic summer line-up of great arcade games at one of Tokyo's most majestic locations, The Imperial Hotel. All of Japan's top gaming journalists were invited to this special press show and nobody was dissapointed with what Konami had to offer. The main event of the show was the final unveiling of Konami's mega fighting game, Fighting Wu-Shu. Previously known under it's code name of \"PF573\", this is Konami's first game to appear on their incredible Cobra board. Those who've been reading our arcade show reports will know we've been following this awesome game for some time, so expectations were high that this could even be a Virtua Fighter 3 beater! Basically, Fighting Wu-Shu uses the traditional 8-way EXCLUSIVE PICTURES OF ITS FIRST GAME! stick and 3 button (guard, punch, kick) control system along with a variety of other fighting techniques and special features. All the characters movements have been motion-captured from top martial artists for amazing realism, and all the action is super smooth. In addition, Fighting Wu-Shu has an amazing Al system where the CPU characters can analyse your fighting style and change their attacks accordingly. With a clearly oriental theme, Fighting Wu-Shu uses some of Asia's greatest martial artists from China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Each character has it's own distinctive personality and unique fighting style that is reproduced with unbelievable realism. In particular, Yun Sonmin, the 28 year old Korean, uses his Tekondo fighting style for devastating results! Using the incredible power of the Cobra board, Konami have been able to create a graphical masterpiece that needs to be seen to be believed. As the characters fight and move, all their clothes fold and move. A nd those with long hair have it waving from side to side. Likewise, the ends of the sashes around their waist.. Take a look out for Fa Yue, the 22 year old lady from Taiwan. When she does a high leg kick, her chinese style dress with the long split down one side) folds beautifully. Not only are the characters incredibly detailed, so are the stages. Each stage is constructed entirely from polygons so it possible to view the stage from every angle.

The deal would have created a a new company SEGABANDAI with consolidated earnings of  billion, making it one of the most powerful players in the global entertainment industry. The reason for the sudden change of heart is said to be from inside Bandai. As quoted in Computer Trade Weekly last month, Sega's president Hayao Nakayama said \"Bandai is a company where employees do their own thing and develop hit products. If we had tried to push through the merger, it would just kill that creativity.\" The news of the deal being called off doesn't seem to have affected Sega's image in the stock market though. Their shares closed \ higher on the announcement day! Bandai's however, dropped by . around your opponent, the stage rotates giving you the opportunity to see all the great surrounding scenery. Some of the stages include a desert, a china-town dis trict, a mountain top and a Korean courtyard. Each stage is full of detail, with such great effects as waves splashing up against the rocks, slowly falling snow and swirling fog etc. In addition, there are other nice little touches such as special lighting effects and interaction with the scenery. Besides Fighting Wu-Shu, Konami were also showing their latest 3D shooting game, Solar Assault and a brand new gun-game, Total Vice. We'll have a full arcade show report next month with details on all these games and more! "

ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT NEWSO BA he MDK TEAM LEAVE SHINY ENTERTAINMENT [SEGA MOVING TOWARDS PC GAMING] Qualifying Phe design team that created MDK on the PC has left Shiny Entertainment to create their own company. While this sounds very dramatic, they are still part of the Interplay group and are also still associated with Shiny. The new company doesn't yet have a name, but includes some well-known names from both Earthworm Jim and MDK Andy Astor, Nick Bruty and Bob Stevenson. Nick Bruty has been quoted as saying that Shiny allowed them to work unhindered, but they are looking for new challenges and that forming a new company is the only way to do so. Ithough Sega have until recently published all their games on the Saturn first, followed by a possible PC conversion around a year  later, they are slowly moving towards simultaneous releases of all games on both formats. Many of their games currently in development are already planned to come out at the same time on both machines, including Last D'OLO60 Bronx and Sega Touring Car. By 1998 they plan to be releasing everything simultaneously. Some people see this as a move by Sega towards becoming purely a software developer, while others feel that it's clever marketing until the release of their heavily-rumoured next console. It can only be good for gamers, as more people get to play Sega's fantastic arcade translations.

I couldn't even get Luke's lightsaber out. The new character is super-bad I was really looking forward to a Tekken Soul Blade thing, but no. This Banjo kazooie game looks very, very similar to Mario 64 as does Conker's Quest. Zelda's there, and looks cool. CAPCOM To surprises. No VF3. Just about the only two games we haven't seen are Sonic R (that's the official name) and Touring Car. Sonic R is a racing game with just the one track at the moment, but it looks really cool. It's very Mario Kartish in appearance. Not ith the Atlanta '97 Electronic sure about the controls, but the visuals are Entertainment Expo happening just awesome. No pop-up, very slick.

Westwood Studios are putting final touches on Blade Runner, a real-time 3D adventure based on the cult movie. The concept is obvious you play a Blade Runner hunting down replicants.

It's an entirely different engine to Doom. CVG: There you go. games are abysmal.. WHAT WHERE WHY HOW PLEASE Dear CVG, I'm a big fan of your mag, but I'm writing to tell you how crap I think the new N64 is. I bought one on the day it came out thinking it would be great, but I was wrong. The graphics are all blurry, the sounds are duff, and the lastability of the games are abysmal. I haven't played Wave Race since I bought that. I swapped Shadows because it's like playing on a pocket  game. Mario is good but it is very overrated, Turok is a quality game, though that is the only true 64bit game. Please leave FIFA 64 alone because it's the only footie game out unless you want to pay around . If Nintendo don't start making games the same quality, the N64 will be a flop. You most probably won't print this letter, but I bet there's a few disappointed readers out there. Where I live the people who've got N64 think this way too. Sorry about moaning, but it has got to be said. Paul McDermott, Woodhouse Park Dear CVG, There are thousands of people who have become interested in the videogames scene, 05 thanks to their increased popularity. However many of these people, being so new, have no idea which machine they should purchase. I have written letters to many mags, CVG included, to seek advice on this matter. So why not introduce a new monthly or bi-monthly feature, whereby you assess all of the current available hardware and give your opinion as to whether it is worth buying. The feature would be recurring because, due to the fast pace at which the market moves, it would be necessary to provide updates each month or how well each machine is doing. You could have minireviews of the top games for each system included in the feature, as well as the opinions of the machine's owners (a hit with Freeplay Fan). You could include all the pros and cons of each system, as well as future hot releases. In this way you would deal with all of the letters which you receive each month, asking for purchasing advice at once. Please use this idea as it will prevent those of us who are as of yet undecided, from purchasing a good machine (like the Jaguar). You could also have a directory of good software shops to compliment Attack Of The Mutant Penguins on the feature. Jaguar. We recommend you don't buy it. Ben A, Tunbridge Wells (OL CVG: This is a genuine letter, folks. Hard to believe. Is anyone else reading this feeling as miserable as Paul McDermott?

"OVER IT NOW computer video games STAR LETTER SPICE GIRLS HERE 55 fluidity of play and animation of the players is exceptional. Roll on June! Another point I'd like to make is regarding the letter in issue #184 about Your Game' ideas. I think this is a really neat idea and would like to see a section in your mag where upon we give our game ideas to you. Big game manufacturers should listen more to what the games playing public want in a game or a sequel as I think they can provide a great inspiration to video games. As your mag is totally brilliant and improved greatly over the last few years think a 'Your Game' section would improve it slightly more, or maybe just replace it instead of the 'Retro Computer Cabin' inside 'Freeplay'. I would certainly like to see more news and 'Red Hot Rumours' section within your mag. Nevertheless your mag is brill so keep up the good work boys!! Daniel Campailla, Llanelli Wales BAROKY Dear CVG, I am writing to you about some of my personal opinions on video games and consoles. First up is Mario 64. Like many other people bought a Nintendo 64 on 1st March along with Mario 64. Having played it for a few months and collected all 120 power stars I do not think that it is the 'REVELATION' that people say. Don't get me wrong, the game is sheer class and a landmark in video games, but somehow I simply don't find it as THE BEST game ever created. I can think of a dozen games which I enjoyed a lot more which have, in my opinion, far greater lastability. But, what astonishes me the most, is that not one of the CVG team voted it as the best game of '96. I am no stranger to the games and console market as have purchased a number of consoles including a Sony PlayStation, Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo and owned a wide variety of games across these formats. Games that I prefer to Mario include Wipeout 2097, Street Fighter Alpha 2, ISS Deluxe, Tekken 2, Resident Evil, etc... Now, I know that Mario is a totally different game and is expertly designed with some wonderful levels, as well as providing a new dimension in video games, but just because it does, doesn't mean that it is the best game ever! My point is that just because a game is uniquely different and offers something that hasn't been seen before in a game it doesn't warrant the title of the best game of all time. Surely a game worthy of that title should have lastability beyond belief and be totally enjoyable and rewarding to play over and over again. And, in my opinion, Mario 64 is not. You even said yourselves in issue #187 that it has no or a lack of competition elements within. After all, what makes a game so unique is playing against a friend. Having said that, I am absolutely delighted with my Nintendo 64 and think that it has a very promising future indeed. ISS 64 looks magnificent as I have seen demos of it and the Dear CVG, Re the letter from 'Mr Bus' of 'Area 51' on the subject of the Spice Girls. Your comment finished off by asking if anyone else had anything to say on this matter. Well, I sure do! I hope you're reading this, Mr Number 21, because I'm going to tear your letter apart piece by piece, boy! Firstly the CVG boys dare to put Mel C ahead of Victoria in their Spice Girls survey because they can. CVG has always been about expressing opinions and if CVG want to express opinions about anything, including the Spice Girls, then I say go ahead. I'm glad we've all got your permission to like Emma or Geri but sorry fella, some of us are just going to like Mel C anyway. I find Mel C more attractive than any of the others for a variety of reasons. For starters, I think she is a beautiful woman (I mean, have you seen that Pepsi ad? WOW!) but it's not just that. Have you ever taken time out to find out what kind of people the Spice Girls are? Or are you the kind of man that is blinded by a fit body? Perhaps you find it impossible to comprehend someone liking Mel C because she is a nice person as well as a gorgeous girl. Have you ever read any of the girls' comments in the press? Or do you just like looking at the pictures? Enjoy 'em while you can matey because with what you're up to blindness is in your future. Maybe I am insane (maybe? I hear you cry) but I'm not going to be called so by a person who calls himself Mr Bus and says he lives at Area 51! I'm also not going to stand by and let you say these things without defending Mel C. Hey, the age of chivalry ain't dead while I'm around, mister! No real man would stoop to personal abuse of a lady but you do gleefully. You find Mel C disgusting? Well, I and plenty of others find you disgusting. And I'm sure the lads at CVG don't need you advising them on their taste in women. Anyway, now I've got that off my chest, I'd just like to say that CVG is still the best mag around, after all these years. Keep up the good work as if you wouldn't. David Booth, Riddings CVG: Mario 64 practically reinvented video games. It's fun to recognise a phenomenal achievement. If you disagree with our opinion that's fine it was deliberately grand. Actually, Tetris IS the greatest game ever! So why not turn to our subscription page now to sample the magic for yourself, FREE!

Clubbing by Purple Ronnie When I go out clubbing Everyone just stares Cos buy a can of Vimto And I stuff it down my flares A GRRRL WRITES groove Dear CVG Wotcha, I'm a 17 year-old woman-thing and I just wanted to say ta for the totally wicked issue #184. I don't normally buy your mag, but it was that wonderful Tekken feature staring up at me that persuaded me to buy it. I'd heard lots about those Tekken games but I thought that they were all about two freakin' muscular blokes beating the crap out of each other. It just so happened that Tekken Il was churning away on the monitors. 'Cor' I thought, noticing those gorgeous polygons with light sourcing. Yep, I was there for freakin' ages staring at it. I flicked through your mag and read more about Tekken. That was two months ago. Now I've got both games and I'm keeping up to date with the latest news by reading your mag. Who'd have thought that pulling off a ten-string into Kazuya's mush could be so darned satisfying? Oh, and get a load of that FMV... (one hour later, after a quick scuffle)... Cheers CVG for showing me the world consumingly brilliant phenomenon that is Tekken! Oh, and hello other Tekken fans!

"computer video games TAMAGOTCHI PARENTAL ADVICE MEMORIES TOO PAINFUL Back in the 1970s a whole bunch of illegal Martial Arts schools began teaching kids how to use weapons, made popular by awesome movies such as Enter The Dragon. Problem is a lot of these kids sustained some terrible injuries due to poor tuition. Either that or they just picked up a set from a shop and took them into school. The BBFC decided to stop fuelling this hysteria. That's the reason. The GTA issue is completely separate, and obvious. LI LONG LI LONG UK VERSION CVG Dear CVG, Dear CVG, In your June 97 issue you had a lot of info about The last couple of issues of Tamagotchis. And as soon as I saw that issue that had your excellent magazine have the Tama's on the front I knew I should get it, because I had me fuming. Don't worry, had just bought my own Tamagotchi the day before. it's not something you've The bad thing was that it said in your magazine that it done it's the industry's new slept for 24 hours. So when it fell asleep at 8pm and Big Brother attitude to went to sleep a while after, I woke up at 7:55am and censorship. Before I got my thought \"AWWW HELL!! My Tamas gonna wake up any PlayStation I was a SNES minute!\" So I quickly ran downstairs to where it was. devotee, and I can remember all and waited for it to wake up again, and at 8am it didn't too well the uproar caused by the get up. Nor at 8:10 or 8:30, but eventually an hour later censorship of games such as at 9:00 it woke up. And between 8-9 I was getting pretty Mortal Kombat (the green 'blood') worried about him, I thought he'd died in his sleep. But and Wolfenstein 3D (the cleaning the main thing was that I could have had at least an up of is so as not to offend any friendly extra hour's sleep, but I had to watch the crummy early Nazis). And now censorship has reared its morning cartoons while I was waiting. So I think in ugly head once more, on the 32-bit systems. future you need to double check on things!!! The Final Fantasy scandal, the Soul Blade Kiel Hanson, Worcestershire controversy and now the merciless slashing out of the saucy 'taste of Honey' pic in CVG: Surely you mean we said they sleep for 12 Fighters Megamix. Don't do it! If the worry is hours? Anyhow, the very last thing on our mind, Kiel, that it will influence people (which for a was to make upset your relationship with that little minute section of the population it will) is Tamagotchi. We'd like to apologise to all parents completely bull. So according to the BBFC if I distressed by any misinformation passed on by CVG... whack someone with nunchukka it is illegal, hey, what is this! We're not your agony aunt Hanson! but it's FINE for me to go hit someone with a big metal stick. Hmm, sorry Sony we love your games but that is just a load of poo. Because of this I am worried what will happen to Duke 3D in all its gory, foul-mouthed nudey girls packed glory. And as for Grand Theft Auto... So, everybody join the Great CVG appeal! Chris Perkins, Canterbury Uk Soul Blade features a weird threepiece weapon. Japanese Soul Edge has nunchukas with blades. Don't touch! JAP VERSION CVG: Nunchukas are cool, aren't they! Which is exactly why the BBFC banned them. YEH, YEH, WAKE US WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED RAMBLING! AMAGOTCHI IN QUAKA VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 MADE OF CARDBOARD I doubt you'll print this, as you obviously like Saturn games a lot, and fell free to cut out anything you don't want to keep. McTarish Penwarden (Tom Bryden), Squatland (East Sussex) Dear CVG, Recently on Channel 4's Digitiser there has been a big argument going on about multiplayer games and how only a few people ever get to play one and that companies are forgetting about the one-player modes. Well one person wrote in saying that he got hold of a Bot for Quake so he could play against something with a bit of sense. Why doesn't id release an official Bot that professional programmers have spent time on? It could be edited by proper game menus by the user instead of all complicated DOS stuff. The Tamagotchi has been a hit, so why not have a Quake Bot as a virtual pet, it could be made so it can learn and be trained to become an unpredictable enemy or your friend. It would be able to learn from its mistakes and soon become so good that you can't beat it, so you could then use it on other players and their Bots. It would sell like Mr T ice lollys. Paul Donnelly, Higher Bebington Dear CVG, Not long ago I got some money, around , when my bank went private or something, and so I thought I'd get an N64, second hand. So I went to Computer Exchange to get a US one, but all there was was one Jap one for a massive !!! So I thought I'd get a Saturn instead, for just  then got VF2 & Fighting Vipers for it. I took it home and set it up next to the beloved PlayStation. I slammed in FV2 and loaded it up. 97% you gave this! No decent intro thought. Oh well, on with the actual game. The animation and players are nice, but the backgrounds are awful! They look like cardboard! I tried the arcade mode and completed it the second time I tried it. I waited for the lovely end sequence but where was it? Huh? So I changed the energy bar to smallest and found I could complete the entire game with one move Jeffry's G+P+K move. Still no end sequence! I remember you saying Tekken 2's CPU as a fool... I played Fighting Vipers through, still to no end sequence?!! Is there a special way to get one? How? I unlocked all the secrets and performed Training mode's moves until | lacked only one or two... okay, three Oks all in less than one day. I still have no Kuma Chan or Pepsi Man, though. Are they in the PAL version? I turned off my Saturn after about 10 minutes when all I got as endings were four still pictures which weren't even much good. I hope Fighters Megamix is better than this. I switched on Tekken 2 and got properly awarded for my efforts with great rendered intros, and endings and a hard computer opponent. I guess I'll just have to buy the (supposedly) awesome NIGHTS. CVG: The translation of VF2 on Saturn is monumental, not because it mimics the arcade look perfectly, but the gameplay is an exact replica. Enjoyment of the game has little to do with stunning intro movies, or end sequences, it's the opportunity to master a range of unique fighters. Wait until you go up against a great Akira player, then you'll understand! Also, you ought to dedicate some time with expert mode in VF2 it's dumb to begin with, but learns as you go along. Eventually you'll find it a challenge to take even one round off the CPU. Of course you can complete the game using one move if the energy bar is down to nothing! You can also complete Tekken 2 on the hardest setting using just one move with nearly all characters down and kick (using the circle button). If you've got such a downer on the Saturn's graphical presentation at this stage, you're gonna find fault with everything on the machine. Tekken 2 is cool to play, and it looks nice. True genius obviously doesn't count with the mainstream. CVG:Yeah, and instead of killing the Tamagotchis you could offer them food and play a game of peek-a-boo. You know AI wasn't invented with the Tamagotchi, Paul. But this is a cute idea. LETTERS LISTEN SON, CALM DOWN AND HAVE A PEPSL. THINGS QET WORSE. I'M NOT IN PAL VERSION. GOD, I'M SORRY! 14 "

"computer video games s TM PlayStation With TR2 levels are now set outside! The interiors are better than ever too! ROM With an enhanced version of the Tomb Raider game engine, Core have been a lot more ambitious with the scenery. And the results seem to have paid off. An excellent Venician townscape. O THE PONY SAYS IT ALL There used to be a time when a game's flaws remained invisible to its producers. Development teams sitting in their ivory tower, away from the fanatical player. Since the first Tomb Raider became available to the world, Core have been well aware of what players especially loved and loathed about the game. Letters they could possibly ignore, but the thousands of individual postings and news-group discussions are still buzzing. Rest assured, every 'what if', and 'I hate it when' has been considered for the sequel. But the ponytail is all Core's idea. A lot of players found the first three levels in Tomb Raider quite uneventful. Expect lots of surprises early on in TR2. The awesome 3DFX version. Compare that antialiased water with the normal PC version below! LARA SCORES AGAIN WITH TOMB RAIDER 2 Lara was pretty agile in Tomb Raider, but players always wished she could do just that little bit more. \"Your wish...\" as the saying goes. New look Lara.

"computer video games PlayStation A new feature! Lara smashes her way through a window! In this early pic, Lara doesn't have her new ponytail. Here it is in motion! Note her new well-rounded breasts too! ES BABY FACE CROCODILE SKIN ROM Odd that Lara doesn't freeze to death in the sub-zero sections of Tomb Raider. Like, how is a pair of Hot Pants and a sleeveless leotard supposed to keep her warm? And those heavy boots are no substitute for flippers when scuba-diving. Strange that her hand-gun doesn't get knackered too. Only a game, remember. Lara's only a bunch of polygons too, remember that. Still this hasn't stopped Core from adding a touch more realism to TR2: climate adjusted clothing, and a target/situation specific set of weapons for Lara. Next time you want Lara to follow your lead into the World Of Ice Cubes mammoth warehouse, she'll want to be properly dressed. And she'll die horribly if confronted with TR2's more terrifying equivelant of a T-Rex with only a pistol to protect herself. (Above) Her new winter wear. (Below) Scuba kit! LARA SCORES AGAIN WITH TOMB RAIDER 2 Lara feels the cold in TR2 a miracle of modern technology, which requires her to wear a virtual fur-lined leather jacket to survive. Lucky she's not a vegan. A harpoon is the only weapon to be seen with when you're in the swim this summer. Come on girls, let's show the boys what we can do. And, SWIM! With her climbing ability, Lara can move sideways to new areas! NO MOUNTAIN TOO HIGH Expect obstacle-based puzzles in Tomb Raider 2 to present even tougher solutions. This is because Lara has more options available: hand-over-hand climbing, and crawling. In Tomb Raider you're typically looking for ledges that are of a suitable height to cling onto, or else some hole in the floor to take a running jump over. Since Lara is now able to venture higher, and slide beneath, there's no telling which route holds the most danger... COVER STORY NO THANKS.

With hype at the max, the game is set to follow in August. And it promises to I he Lost World is one of the biggest match the roar of its big screen counterpart! SEA SATURN THE LOST WORLD he Lost World is one of the biggest cinematic thrills of the year. Maybe ever! But whether you've seen it or not yet, you can work yourself into a frenzy about that by turning to our back page. Here we're gonna talk about the game. A game that has to live up to that movie. In effect, a game that has to dazzle and terrify the player with super-realistic prehistoric monsters! But more so, it has to submerge you interactively in their environment. When the last Jurassic Park franchise was turned into a game, we had only 16-bit consoles to play on. And the scariest dinosaur was a sprite of T-Rex head sticking out of a cave. Now we've got PlayStations and Saturns with powerful 3D graphics. So what terrors does The Lost World intend unleashing onto us with this technology? THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE, NOW BE THE DINO! THE BREEDING GROUND The Lost World game promises incredible animation. This little 'Compy' dodging through the legs of a Brachiosaur should give you some idea of how it moves! The most obvious concept for a Lost World game would be to put you in the role of a human, running, around killing dinosaurs and trying to escape. Something like Turok perhaps, or Tomb Raider. But Dreamworks, the development crew behind the project, were far more ambitious. They wanted to create a game that visualised the setting of the film (Isla Sorna, the breeding site for the dinos seen in Jurassic Park) beyond those seen in the film. As such, they held daily brainstorming sessions and put together storyboards that eventually resulted in a 100-page concept document. One which detailed a 3D action game set over 40 levels with 25 different environments and 20 separate species of dino, Doesn't sound like anything special, but then you've yet to see who you can play as... COMING SOON 22 Whatever creature you play as, the key is survival! "

The Hunter is armed with a flame thrower and grenades, and faces deadly carnivores in their natural environment. The scientist uses more technical equipment to stay alive. Aside from them, you get the choice of controlling three dinosaurs! The Compy is a tiny dino, but that makes it agile for _escaping huge predators. The Raptor lets you race about as a swift savage predator, armed with incredible leaping power and ripping claws. And finally there's the T-Rex, giving you incredible strength and the ability to devour any creature in your path! PlayStation The intelligent camera pans about giving you the best angle for playing. It also provides some breathtaking views! TV SEGA SATURN O.O.O. THEY'RE ALIVE! ALIIIVE!! OO O THE LOST WORLD THE LOST WORLD In bringing the game dinosaurs to life, Dreamworks wanted to make them as realistic as possible! As such, they used, latest scientific theories on posture and musculature, together with real skeletal references and Stan Winston's models for the movie, to visualise dinosaurs with a convincing mass and weight. Of course, creating real-time dinos is somewhat different from the pre-rendered monsters from the movie. As such, low polygon 3D models were used, with detailed texturing overlayed. These seamless single-mesh models were then stretched about to test their durability before animation work began. To create convincing movement, Dreamworks studied the present day counterparts of dinosaurs by visiting LA Zoo. Some of them even acted out some dino, moves themselves. The original JP movie was also used as reference for the likes of the Raptor. T-Rex and Brachiosaur. These moves were then applied to DreamWorks MorphX animation engine to bring the living, breathing, flexing creatures to life! YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE, NOW BE THE DINO! JUNGLE MUSIC!

"computer games TENDO 64 SPY SIMULATION 50% COMPLETE BY OCEAN  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE CARTRIDGE NOV RELEASE 1 PLAYER  RELEASED BY OCEAN TEL: 0161 832 6633 NINTENDO 64 11:01 One of last years most exciting films is going to be one of this year's most exhilarating games. Read these pages well, they self destruct in twelve minutes... ission: Impossible was a staggering movie success. Made all the more impressive because it ambitiously attempted to update a cult 60's TV show. A series with an unforgettable theme tune, self-destructing tape players, but few other trademark features to work with. Yet the resulting movie fully demonstrated the blockbuster potential in reinventing classic action serials. And so comes the videogame on N64, with a similar reinvention task on its hands. It's being developed by Ocean, infamous for a slew of (frankly) poor film licenses on 8 and 16-bit machines. Now they intend on redeeming their reputation. No loosely-connected, formulaic, knocked-out platformer here. With Nintendo 64, Ocean intend on bringing out a Mission: Impossible game that matches the thrill, tension, atmosphere and look of the movie. And in the same effort pushes movie licenses into new area of excellence. Impossible! MISSION: 2 IMPOSSIBLE 14:37 MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE Mission: Impossible promises spy action to match the thrills of the movie! Expect edge-of-the-seat tension as you race against the clock to finish missions. GREETINGS MR PHELPS! 10:45 The mission, as Ocean chose to accept it, was to make a game worthy of Paramount's franchise and Nintendo 64's power. 3D was an obvious ingredient, but a mere action-based corridor affair didn't seem right. Especially as the movie concentrated more on stealth, infiltration and trickery. Spy stuff! So that's what the developers decided to make the game into a spy simulation! As they describe it themselves, \"it simulates people in the same way a flight sim simulates planes!\" A game in which you have to use CIA training and electronic gadgets to \"out-smart' opponents. Okay, we're still listening.. NOOS INIWOD 5:22 24 "


"30 058 MISSIONSIMPLAUSIBLE TO computer Video games While the game is strongly influenced by the movie, basing the whole thing on it would have been a tad hard, considering the film only features three main action set pieces. These are featured in the game, however some license has been taken with with the plot to give the game more missions. Here's a brief rundown of what's in store for your N64 IM team. It should also give you a brief idea about how the missions aren't just action-based, but more laterally minded. NINTENDO 64 All-out gung-ho action isn't the key. You've got to sneak about... ...until it all gets a bit messy. Then it's time to wipe out the gun! MISSION 1: THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY HIS DAD'S CALLED MIKE! Based on the first big mission from the film, with a level design to match. Here though, the aim is to rescue a computer programmer imprisoned in the Embassy catacombs, and gain her help in recovering a stolen list of CIA operatives. * MISSION 2: THE ARMS DEALER * An example of the game's new extravagant plot. Here, terrorists are planning to buy nuclear weapons from a dealer in Norway. You have to infiltrate the arms dealer's base and induce the two negotiating sides to fall out, killing themselves. Tom Cruise played an all-new Mission: Impossible character in the movie agent Ethan Hunt. And that's who you get to control in the game. The incredibly detailed character (much like all the others in the game) is generated using around 350 textured polygons. However, detailed as Ethan's face is, there's something wrong with it Ocean weren't allowed to use Tom Cruise's visage ( a request from the star himself!). As a result they used a composite of features. Although Ocean won't say who was used (for legal reasons), the suggestion is that Ethan's mug may or may not have elements of Tom Cruise, and one other movie star who might just enjoy a nice Royale with cheese, in between some funky disco strutting! * MISSION 3: ESCAPE FROM THE CIA * With too many successful missions under your belt, you are arrested by the CIA accused of being an enemy mole and imprisoned in their HQ. The aim here is simple to escape! MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE * MISSION 4: INFILTRATE THE CIA * Having escaped, you now have to go back in! In an effort to uncover the real 'mole', you work for the other side, entering the CIA building to steal the second part of the NOC list. We haven't seen this bit, but we hope it's like the thrilling computer-room scene from the movie. * MISSION 5: WATERLOO STATION MAKE CONVERSATION, NOT WAR! The build up to the big finalé. You have to get the enemy (Max from the movie) to lead you to the mole. As such you have to avoid her bodyguards at the station and follow her onto the train. MISSION 6: THE TRAIN COMING SOON This CG mock-up shows how you 'quietly' disarm foes. Mission: Impossible's passive 'spy' sim nature lends itself to an all-new type of gameplay. One which Ocean say \"stems from the interaction of all the characters with each other and the player\". In other words, you have to play it cool! Running around, shooting everyone in sight, will soon screw up the delicate nature of the missions. Instead you have to use more cerebral techniques. Ethan has total interaction (well nearly) with all characters. Allowing him to talk to, knock out, take the clothes, and when he has the gadget copy the faces, of anyone he encounters. So for example, when trying to get through a security gate, instead of hopelessly blasting your way through, it's far more effective to disguise yourself as someone with access. No suspicion aroused! The final level promises a bit more in the way of all-out action, as you'd expect from a climactic ending! Having uncovered the mole, you have to chase them through the train, blasting enemy agents out of the way. Just like the movie, there's enemy support from a helicopter. Only this time it's blowing up the carriages, and you have to stay one step ahead! 2 . F 25 "


"computer video games VIEW TO A THRILL! $. ! NINTENDO 64 NOT AS STUPID AS HE LOOKS! ooo With 3D games, how the action is viewed plays a very important part. Mission: Impossible uses a third-person view, similar to Tomb Raider's but more advanced. Floating cameras swoop and pan around intelligently to give the best view. When just walking around, these cameras remain at a distance. However, pull out your gun and the camera swings down over Ethan's shoulder. What's more, his body turns translucent and a target appears, allowing you to more accurately aim. Don't think this is a license to kill though. On Tom Cruise's strict orders, Ethan shoots to kill no-one in the game. All his shots are tranquiliser darts, and they don't last long! All this 'interaction' with computer characters obviously requires more than just dumb 'drones' wandering about. As such, the development team have spent ages perfecting a complex artificial intelligence system. Each individual 'being' has its own multilayered Al, specifically linked to a realistic eyesight and hearing system. At its basic level, this means everyone goes about their normal tasks. A waiter, for example, will keep serving drinks. However, should it see or hear anything suspicious this program is interrupted. Wave your gun around and the waiter will call for help. Shoot at him and he'll run for his life. A guard won't be quite so wimpy though! EN 1 The floating cam gives you full 360 vision when exploring! Another CG mock-up showing how the characters will perform normal duties in the game. This Joe Brown lookalike waiter won't be so chirpy when he sees Ethan behind. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 1 Trouble! The camera zooms behind Ethan's see-thru head! CUE LIGHTING OF MATCH... This is the computer expert you have to rescue in level one. This pic and the two below are only mock-ups. Mission: Impossible is famed for its Lalo Schifrin themetune and its a guarantee the final game will have that tune (well, it better be!). However, the musical treats of Mission: Impossible: The N64 Game go far further. In a trick fleetingly used by Mario 64. the music changes according to your circumstance. If you're in a stealth situation, the music matches the mood. Get discovered though and the 1 Expect plenty of tense music for tunes power-up. All adds up to 'sneaking around' sections of the a lot more atmosphere. game, like the one mocked up here. 1 What music this bathroom scene will have is a mystery to us. Tinkly elevator jazz perhaps?

"computer video games SURVIVAL HORROR BY CAPCOM 90% COMPLETE  PLAYSTATION VERSION AVAILABLE  SATURN VERSION PLANNED  -am OUT AUGUST 1 PLAYER  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY VIRGIN TEL 0171 368 2255 ROM The smash PlayStation title of last year finally hits the PC in a blaze of '3D-chips' glory. If you've got the hardware, this is one, game to look out for! BESIDENTEKTE THE AWESOME RESIDENT EVIL GETS A PC MAKEOVER! hen Resident Evil was released on the PlayStation in 1996, it bought a whole new game bracket into the public eye Survival Horror! Never before had a game actually been genuinely scary. The dogs breaking through the windows, the monster flying out of the wardrobe and the first time a supposedly \"dead' zombie starts munching on your ankle. No other game has even come close to the atmosphere that Capcom created. Sadly for PC owners, they never had the chance to experience the world of 'survival horror', until now. Courtesy of Virgin and a little bit of wheelin' and dealin', 3Dfx owners will see the goriest European version hit their machines in August. Whether any new stuff has been added though is as yet, unclear. It will be more than a perfect conversion though, with the added power and memory at the programmers' disposal. Needless to say though if any developments occur, CVG will keep you very well informed! THE POSSIBILITIES AREENDLESS... By just looking at some of these screenshots, you can see just how much the game benefits from the added power of the PC. The detail on the Hunters prompted comments such as «Has this version got new monsters?\" and the ultra realistic look on the characters faces is pretty remarkable. Here we have a few comparison shots. PC PLAYSTATION READERS WITH RICH PARENTS REJOICE!!  The good new for all those PC owners with bank accounts larger than Alan Shearer's wallet or those who have a disturbingly wealthy dad, is that this game will run like a dream. It supports all of the major 3Dfx cards and PCs with Power VR or Matrox Mystique. If you own any of the following, jump for joy. If you don't, THIS GAME WON'T WORK! We just wanted to clear that up early. PC PLAYSTATION MY MASTER DOESN'T HAVE A NOSE. HOW DOES HE SMELL? AWFULI ARF ARF! PC PLAYSTATION 28 If you look inside the crack in the wall, a clip should be inside. Cheers Baz mate. But I could have gorn and blown is 'ead off! "


"computer video games IS THAT A ZOMBIE IN YOUR POCKET, OR ARE YOU JUST HAPPY TO SEE ME? A CAST OF THOUSA INDS OO There are a hell of a lot more characters to Resident Evil than meets the eye. Chris and Jill are just the tip of the Iceberg when it comes to the Bravo and Alpha teams. Let CVG guide you through the cast. ROM ENRICHO MARINI MISSION LEADER FORCE: BRAVO TEAM AGE: 41 HEIGHT: 6FT N WEIGHT: 183 LBS BLOOD TYPE: 0 BRAVO Leader of the Bravo team and second only to Wesker for having complete control of the STARS unit. One of the only members who is actually alive when you locate him, he has already twigged onto the double crossing... to his eternal cost. INTLHE BEGINNING. This is the head of Kenneth that the first zombie has bitten off! RICHARD AIKEN COMMUNICATIONS FORCE: BRAVO TEAM AGE: 23 HEIGHT: 5FT 8IN WEIGHT: 138 LBS BLOOD TYPE: AB BRAVO Richard doesn't fare quite as well as Enricho, as you encounter his mutilated body just before you meet Yawn the Snake for the first time. He was the communications expert for both the teams and served as the only link back to HQ when on location. For all those that have been locked away in dungeons for the past year or so, here are a couple of basic facts about Resident Evil. Depending on which character you choose to play as, also alters the difficulty setting. Jill is easier, as she can carry more items and has a shorter version of the game. She also picks up the better weapons earlier on in the game, like the Rocket Launcher. Remember that ammo is sparse inside the mansion, so shooting zombies in the backs when they are on the floor is recommended as it does more damage than a standard shot. When you have the shotgun, shoot the zombies in the head and they'll die with one bullet every time. FOREST SPEYER VEHICLE SPECIALIST FORCE: BRAVO TEAM AGE: 29 HEIGHT: 6FT WEIGHT: 157 LBS BLOOD TYPE: A AVO Despite being Alpha teams deadliest shot for he is a sniper he falls foul to the evil crows and is one of the first corpses you discover. If you're playing with Jill, you can take his rocket launcher, whereas Chris only finds one clip by his remains. The detail on the Hunter has been greatly improved. Awesome! KENNETH J. SULLIVAN FIELD SCOUT FORCE: BRAVO TEAM AGE: 45 HEIGHT: 6FT 2IN WEIGHT: 213 LBS BLOOD TYPE: 0 BRAVO \"A mere shadow of his former self.\" That's Kenneth. Unfortunately, you stumble across him just a few seconds too late, as a zombie finishes munching on his neck and his head rolls round on the floor. Search his body for a couple of clips though. THE AWESOME RESIDENT EVIL GETS A PC MAKEOVER! REBECCA CHAMBERS MEDICAL FORCE: BRAVO TEAM AGE: 18 HEIGHT: 5FT 3IN WEIGHT: 93 LBS BLOOD TYPE: AB RAVO The only member of Bravo team who stays alive until the end of the game, providing you do your job properly. A relative newcomer to the team, who has only recently been recruited for her knowledge of first aid. Keep her alive at all costs! These stills from the intro may not be make it to the final version. ALBERT WESKER MISSION LEADER FORCE: ALPHA TEAM AGE: 38 HEIGHT: 6FT WEIGHT: 186 LBS BLOOD TYPE: 0 There is a lot more to Wesker than meets the eye. We'll not say any more than that, but needless to say, he has a few skeletons in his cupboard. He is the leader of the STARS outfit and as a result has the attitude to go with the rank. BARRY BURTON WEAPONS SPECIALIST > FORCE: ALPHA TEAM AGE: 38 HEIGHT: 6FT WEIGHT: 197 LBS BLOOD TYPE: A PHA The longest serving member of the S.T.A.R.S. team, Barry is one of its most respected members. If you're playing as Jill, Barry appears frequently throughout the quest to give her some much needed help and assistance. COMING BRAD VICKERS PILOT FORCE: ALPHA TEAM AGE: 35 HEIGHT: 5FT SIN WEIGHT: 134 LBS BLOOD TYPE: 0 ALPHA You never actually see him physically, but you hear his voice as he is the one who pilots the helicopter that picks you up from the end of the game. He is also the one who drops the rocket launcher you need to blow up the Tyrant at the finalé. Once a spider gets close, you're in big trouble! WHAT HAPPENED TO JILL AND WESKER? Just a quick note to tell you about the intro. As yet Virgin are unsure whether the full version on the preview disk will make it into the final game, but it is incredibly bloody. In comes the eye hanging out from the dog, the bones popping out from the hand that is still holding the gun, and the mutilated faces of the team. Also included is Kenneth's head rolling about showing his half eaten face. This is one game that is definitely not for the faint hearted! We'll tell you what happened. They're tooling up in time for next month's issue of CVG, where we'll give you the lowdown on how this version matches up to its predecessor. 29 "

This month we turn up the heat as the work nears its completion. Of the four games included, only Sonic & Knuckles still needs fine-tuning. So, having given you a taster of the 3D museum front-end in the last issue, we thought we'd take this chance to refamiliarise (or perhaps introduce) you to each of the games in turn. And also show just a little bit of what makes them some of the greatest video games ever made! USIPINO SCORE TIME 8:10 RINGS 23 SONIC 2: 1992 This hugely-awaited follow-up was launched worldwide on the now legendary Sonic Twosday (24th November 1992), at the very peak of the Mega Drive's popularity Joining a sleaker Sonic was a sidekick Tails (controllable with the second pad), a funky two-player race mode, the essential super-spin, even sharper levels (more of them too), and the awesome surprise of yellow Super Sonic! Without a doubt, this was the coolest game in its day! SONIC THE HEGDGEHOG: 1991 The game that started the ball (and hedgehog) rolling. Blatantly lifting the platform formula laid down by the 8-bit Mario games, it added all the trademark frills that single-handedly turned the Mega Drive into a worldwide success. Superfast action, wickedly constructed roller-coaster levels, brilliant graphics and sound, and most importantly, an universally appealing character! SONIC 3: 1992 SONIC: THE ESSENTIAL COLLECTION! SCORE 200 TIME 0:24 After a long period of near-complete silence, this game exploded into existence in February '94. A new grittier graphical style with a boss-eyed, bandy-legged Sonic matched the more aggressive gameplay. Cool power-ups (fire, magnetism, bubble shield), levels with more action set-pieces (level one explodes into fire!) and a new 'misguided' enemy, Knuckles, made this the paciest of the series. Marred only by a weak ending. But then there was a reason for this... Sonic 2's split-screen mode used hi-res compression!

SONIC & KNUCKLES: 1994 PUNI Released in October of the same year, this was Sonic Team's big finalé to the Mega Drive series. What made it so unique was the fact that the cartridge was openended, allowing other Sonic games to be plugged in. With Sonic's 1 and 2 this just meant extra bonus levels, or playing Knuckles in Sonic 2. But with Sonic 3, it became the 'true' second half of the game giving you access to Knuckles only sections of the levels, and presenting Hyper Sonic and Super Tails! Definitely the most thrilling of the Sonic games. The massive levels were packed with surprises like this! Knuckles could climb! ELECTRIC BLUE!

The sequel to one of the greatest RPGs on the PC finally rears it's head from the shadows, and prepares to estwood. The talent behind such great games as Command and Conquer and ...er Command and Conquer: Red Alert. They're not only confined to that classic strategy game though, for they have also given us Dune II, Eye of the Beholder, Monopoly and of course Lands of Lore. Not ones to rest on their laurels and turn out endless sequels to the C&C series, they have decided to return to their RPG roots. Guardians of Destiny is the follow up to the popular Throne of Chaos adventure. Take on the role of Luther, cursed son of Scotia and prepare to explore these strange and ancient lands. LAND OF LORE 2 GUARDIANS OF PESTINY THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD BE THE CHANGING MAN IN LANDS OF LORE ! As with all RPGs there is a lot of back-story and history to wade through, before you begin the game proper. The Lands of Lore you are about to journey through are rich in feuds, battles, magic and sorcery, curses, monsters and death! It is an incredibly detailed world. In the first game your character explored the land searching for an elixir to aid the poisoned King Richard. The evil Scotia (boo, hiss) was behind this treachery, and is now in possession of the Nether Mask. With this mask she can assume the shape of any living creature. Needless to say. Scotia the Sorceress met with her maker, and all wrongs were righted. Or were they? Before her demise, Scotia had managed to send the mask to her son Luther. However the transmission was jumbled in the ether, producing a warped version of the mask. Now Luther has the power of the shape changing magic, but has no control over it. As Luther you must search for a cure, but there are others in the land that want the mask! MOVE ANY MOUNTAIN No, the guard doesn't have bad dandruff, he's just been attacked by Luther magic. Not content with interaction from the other creatures in this land? Then simply interact with the objects. Each location contains 'hot' objects that can be moved or positioned for your advantage. Placing boxes on top of each other, to create stairs allows you to reach previously unreachable secret areas. Again it is possible to dispose of enemies by interaction with objects. Moving pillars can make ceilings cave in, and messing with water channels can cause rooms to flood. Careful positioning of the pillars here, result in the guard being squashed. SPLAAAAATTT! Hey it's the cousin of the wampa ice creature they put in Empire Strikes Back Special Edition. 36 "


"computer video games OUR FUGITIVE IS ARMED AND DANGEROUS ROM The Nether Mask that has produced your curse is also the bearer of more bad tidings. Other people want it! The mask is a source of great magical power and two rival parties need it for their own purposes. An evil creature known as the Mother Beast is seeking the mask, so she can use the ancient magic to resurrect the even more sinister Belial. Mother Beast has begun to spawn her lesser children grotesque spider-like creatures, which tunnel to the surface in search of magic. The odds aren't entirely stacked against you as the rival camp are almost on your side. Draracle will stop at nothing to thwart Belial's plans. Luther seeks out Draracle in order to find a cure, and is then directed to visit the Southern Continent. He is not alone on his journey of this new land! PLEASE DON'T HURT ME! Although Luther will encounter many creatures, not all of them are his enemies. The game brilliantly mixes FMV sequences of the inhabitants into the normal surroundings. During these moments you are free to converse and gather as much information as possible. Should you grow tired of the chat, you can of course kill the creature. However, do this too many times and word will spread of your evil ways. Which will have serious ramifications later in the game, when what were once friendly creatures, will attack you instead of sharing vital clues. Luther must beware of the creatures lurking in the forest. A villager. He's armed, though he might offer help. By using magic spells near this pool of oil. Luther is able to produce sparks and ignite anything that may be nearby! BE THE CHANGING MAN IN LANDS OF LORE ! COOL HAND LUTH Combat with other creatures you encounter is simple. In your inventory, click on the weapon of choice, then drag the icon onto the hand of Luther. It is worth mentioning that combat is not always necessary. Hack at your opponent one too many times with a sword, and you might damage any valuables they might be possessing. Often armour can be ruined by doing this. Instead, look for other means to dispose your enemies. Early in the game it is possible to use magic to explode a guard! The guard in question happens to be standing in a pool of oil. Not very clever if you can fire lightning bolts! COMING SOON a DON'T GO CHANGING, REARRANGING... SUPER LUTHER, LIGHTS ARE GONNA FIND ME! Luther's curse sees him transforming into different creatures against his will. Ranging from a tiny lizard to a hideous beast. While the transformations might not last long before he reverts back to human form, they can pose problems. While in lizard-form, Luther must be wary of larger creatures. Even spiders can pose a threat! However, the curse can also be a blessing in disguise. At the start of the game Luther must escape from a dungeon through caves. These are patrolled by guards. Changing into a large beast will give Luther the upper hand against human opponents, improving the chances of his escape. Lands of Lore 2 is shaping up to be a mammoth adventure. Four CDs worth of game should have most RPG fans occupied for ages. The completion and release of the game is imminent, so stay tuned for a review real soon. 37 "

"Video IT'S TOO BIG TO BE A SPACE STATION û û O games ROM The new Jedi Knight game engine, nicknamed Sith is even more impressive than Quake's. Not because it looks better, but for the fact that it does things differently. Instead of the 2.5D of the original game, Jedi Knight is a full 3D affair. Complete with polygonated texturemapped characters and of course, light sourcing which makes the whole thing look, even more dramatic. The really revolutionary thing is the ability to change the view form Kyle's first-person perspective, to a new thirdperson floating camera. This makes the game, look a lot like Tomb Raider. The reason for this extra sense of your surroundings is simple. To make the lightsaber duels effective, you will need to see them from an external view.

Loyal to no-one, he is merciless, bitterless and very strong. TALES OF THE JEDI SARISS A Jedi who doesn't rely on physical strength, but on the mental aspects of the Force. She is described as a master and perfectionist, quiet and observing. BOC A line up of villains. Gorc and Pic are on the right, the other two could be Yun and Maw. A bit of a show-off this Jedi. Not content with one lightsaber, he wields two. He also likes to taunt and play with his opponents. 1 Someone else looking like Kyle, it can only be a death match. We can't wait! The multiplayer part of the game is what most players are really getting excited about. LucasArts are great admirers of their audience, and if enough people request something you can guarantee they pay attention. Well, here's what the fans of Dark Forces wanted most multiplayer battles! You will be able to use the character you have built-up in single player mode (an extra incentive to play the single player game several times to the end). Those that have progressed further into the single player game, should therefore be stronger in The Force. Multiplayer modes include all-out combat, team battles, and a mode similar to Capture the Flag games. Expect about eight purpose-built death match levels to come with the finished game. The level of detail in the graphics will even allow you to see what weapon each opponent is wielding! JEREC Kyle's ultimate nemesis, and with a reason Jerec killed Kyle's father.

TM OCT RELEASE 1 PLAYERS PlayStation  RELEASED BY SONY TEL 0171 533 1400 la TIS-IR PlayStation When lan Hetherington, head of Psygnosis, says a game is going to be the Christmas number one, you've got to listen. And that's exactly what he said of G-Police! G-POLICE sygnosis' PlayStation track record is impeccable. WipEout sold one-forone with the machine on its launch. And Formula One broke all CD-ROM records with its first week sales. So the likelihood of Psygnosis claiming the no.1 spot on this Christmas' gaming charts seems like a fair bet. But with such an impressive end-of-year line-up (see last issue's New Games), choosing the pick of the bunch would seem a tough task. Not that Psygnosis think so. Their confidence in G-Police is unflappable. Describing it as a fast exciting flight simulator, the development team thought it would be \"cool to fly around a dense city environment' instead of the usual flat featureless landscapes. However, restrictions were needed to stop the player just flying away from the city. Encasing the cities in domes was the answer. The explanation? The cities are off-world colonies. And you are a Blade Runner style cop. Only five months to Christmas... * WELCOME TO FUTUROPOLIS! G-POLICE: IT'S WIPEOUT 2097 IN COP CARS! The year is 2097. The place is Jupiter's moon, Callisto. Following an Earthshattering (literally) war, people have abandoned government in favour of corporations and their method of running society so it's good for business'. Enter the G-Police, an independent law enforcement agency created to safe guard the corporation territories. Patrolling the cities in their airborne HAVOC gunships, they are ruthlessly efficient. Now meet Jeff Slater G-Cop, Airborne Division. A man with a personal mission. His sister, a fellow HAVOC pilot, died in action, the circumstances were suspicious, and he want to know what they were! 10 EMB-100D 200 **NIS FINE MIS-STAR Blade Runner is a confessed inspiration. The cityscapes are incredible looking! UP AND AT 'EM! COMING SOON You, of course, play Jeff Slater. Which means you get to pilot the HAVOC. Similar to a modern-day gunship, the main difference is it doesn't have any rotors, instead being ion-powered. That aside, it fulfils the developers' intentions to make a kind of flight sim, controlling like a highly manoeuverable helicopter. Add to this some meaty weaponry ranging from the mainstream Vulcan Cannon to a devastating Plasma Launcher to a hundred kilo bomb, capable of obliterating buildings! Of course, being a cop you can't just unleash ammo freely all civilian traffic is vulnerable to your weapons. That said though, you won't be too badly scolded for civilian termination, the authorities know how hard your job is! Sketches of the HAVOC air support craft. No rotors, but basically a copter.

PRIME DIRECTIVE There are 35 missions to G-Police, all set across bustling 3D cityscapes. Although all are heavily biased toward shoot 'em up action, the developers wanted to avoid churning out the typical find/ destroy scenarios. Each mission offers something new, and as you grow in experience you can take control of wingmen and co-operate with ground units. What's more, the missions take place in real-time. Fail to react to a situation and the trouble continues to escalate. Watching other characters attempting to cope without your help is fascinating... until you fail. X CALL THE GRAPHICS-POLICE! * Actually don't, because G-Police's graphics are turning out to be awesome! The actual game engine has been developed as a generic one to use in future, products. Its strength is in creating enormous environments (cityscapes for example) without using up a lot of memory. As such, the extra memory can be used to add finer details to the environments. In G-Police's case this means a more populated city, with chimney flames and rotating billboards (Psygnosis have typically signed up some cool advertising logos for these!). Even the traffic follows the highway code! The effects too, are superb, with incredible, light-sourcing, explosions and weapon effects. The developers admit that currently this has forced them to lower the pop-up distance. However as the game is optimised they promise this problem is being gradually eased. And if anyone knows what they're doing graphically, its Psygnosis! G-POLICE: IT'S WIPEOUT 2097 IN COP CARS! A peliminary sketch of a ground assault vehicle.

Psygnosis claim the SG-generated FMV in G-Police is 'some of the best seen in a game' and they're not wrong! The intro looks straight out of Aliens (the pre-production version we saw even used the Aliens soundtrack temporarily), as G-Cops run around urban environments blasting away. Highly cinematic, the motion-captured movement is incredible. However, it's the faces that are most impressive, with virtual actors pulling totally realistic expressions, generated using optical motion-capture. What's more, these FMV scenes aren't just decorative, they're intended as part of the gameplay experience. Only by listening to what is said will you follow the ever contorting plot and understand your missions.

It immediately became the fastestselling CD game of all-time, and gave the PlayStation a massive boost, so it's no surprise to find that there's a new version on its way. What may be surprising is that Psygnosis aren't just updating some of the drivers and adding a few new features all the criticisms of the first game are being addressed. Also, the licence is completely up-to-date, rather than being a year behind as with most officially-licenced games this season's teams, drivers and courses. It looks as though Psygnosis may well have another biggie on their hands. THIS LAP 211 TAG HEUER Oetalning As in the first Formula 1 game, there are two main modes Arcade and Grand Prix.

There are also some nice effects like lens flare, which manages to appear in nearly every game at the moment. The difference here is that the developers have thought about it a bit better than most people, meaning that you only see lens flare when viewing the game from a TV camera, and not during the races (we never could understand why Turok got such an amazing lens flare from his eyeballs).

Every month we get an awesome line-up of top releases in Checkpoint. But that could just be because Checkpoint is totally inaccurate and it's all those games that keep slipping, just piling up towards the end of the year (not our fault though see disclaimer at bottom right). Nonetheless, if Checkpoint is to be believed this month, we've got some real corkers coming. In July, Syndicate Wars and Warcraft 2 provide PlayStation boffins with some mind food. PlayStation Castlevania (a total sell-out in Japan) finally arrives. Alien Trilogy and Bust-AMove 2 join Sony's Platinum range. And the long-awaited and awesome looking PS boat game, Rapid Racer is slated for the end of the month. On the PC front, the potentially top Broken Sword 2 is set for release, together with Jedi Knight 2, Manx TT, Myst 2 (not one we're particularly interested in) and the promising Star Trek: Star Fleet Academy. And N64 owners finally get to play Doom! August is a HUGE month for N64, with the UK release of what we consider to be the machine's best game since Mario Star Fox 64. Air Combat 2 and Formula 1 '97 are also on the cards. As is our regular red herring', the never-seen, totally unspoken about, but always on the list Planet Of The Apes!

Sega Rally, of course, no contest! Well, Ocean are hoping that their own V-Rally is a Sega Rally ast year, the Saturn proved its power beater, and they may just have a case... SERR locoool1 B JOBB 5 ast year, the Saturn proved its power with its 'Big Three' titles. Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Cop and Sega Rally. Three awesome arcade games that have translated superbly onto Sega's 32 bit machine. The PlayStation needed something to challenge these titles and started warming up its own money spinning titles. Tekken 2 challenged VF2 to the fighting game crown. Time Crisis will be out in Japan by the time you read this and probably stealing the limelight from Cop (and Cop 2) as the best gun game around in the process. And now V-Rally has touched down to provide PlayStation owners with a perfect alternative to SR. V-Rally can be looked upon as a new age at Ocean. Having suffered sales wise with titles like X2 and Cheesy, this title represents a huge step in the right direction for the Manchester-based company. And considering Sony tried to buy the title from them instead of releasing their own Rally Cross, that must tell us something about the quality as well. 97 'CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION STAGE 0010 40 6P 0000 1 LAPI AMEWUPERION 306 MAXI 102 This narrow bridge will cause a crash EVERY time. Awesome! W ........................... THE CHOICE OF CHAMPIONS .A . Even though V-Rally has a choice of Arcade and Championship modes, the actual game doesn't change or the handling of the car doesn't differ. Some of the smaller elements alter though, give you enough variation between the two. Take a brief look at them both starting with the Arcade mode. ARCADE MODE GEST STAGE OTS 54P 01204 You begin this with only four courses to choose from, and you have to play each of them through in order to gain access to the next. Once they have been completed, you can move onto the next set of six tracks. Once those have been negotiated Successfully, another eight can be raced under. The only downside is that you have to complete all of the tracks in that group before you can save your game.

Also, the championship runs in a league basis, so the emphasis is on you to finish higher up to gain more points and progress onto the next group of tracks.

"computer IN THE COUNTRY! THE LINK CABLE LIVES ON ViCEO games The country scenes for the stages of V-Rally are all extremely detailed and very true to life. When driving in England it's nearly always chucking it down with rain, whereas Spain is set along coastlines and sunsets. Icy roads and snowfall is waiting for you when you journey to the French Alps as well. The variation of the stages is one of V-Rally's big strengths. V-Rally also benefits from a strong multi-player element. The game enables you to play a split-screen two player mode, and you have the choice of dividing the Screen horizontally or vertically. You can also have a two-player link-up game. But best of all, and perhaps the saving grace for the doomed link-up cable, is the four player link-up mode. This enables two people to play on one screen and another two on another screen. Absolute mayhem wouldn't you agree? PlayStation Nothing stereotypical about this country, what with you racing in rice fields and all that! The tropical weather fluctuates between blazing sunshine and pouring rain. The surface is always gravel, so make sure the tyres are equipped accordingly. A pile up is inevitable. WE'RE THE BOYS TO TRUST Our own beloved country is also set entirely on gravel, so by now you should be used to the handling and power-sliding on this surface. If you're playing the Championship Mode, it's also be the first time you encounter a night level. As you're probably aware by now, the terrain you are racing on and the tyres you equip, affect the performance of the car during races. The default setting for tyres is Asphalt, which is standard road surface. This is probably the easiest set of tyres to use because they have a high grip, so you won't skid around as often. There is also a wet version for rain conditions on the road. Gravel levels are a power-sliders heaven, and with the wheels to match, the rally element really starts to hit home. The fourth wheel variant is specifically for snow. This has untold amounts of grip, but due to the conditions you end up using them in, that becomes redundant. Cut through the middle. -SPAIN och weils CAR SETTINGS INDONESIA SNOW Sun, sea, sand and Skodas? Not the ideal combination, but even so Spain houses some tough stages. Asphalt is the choice of track here, so you don't need to slide as much, because of the increased grip. Remember to switch to wets in the rain. TYRE TYPE GRAVEL SUSPENSION MEDIUM GEAR RATIO : NORMAL UNDER OVERSTEER GEARBOX AUTOMATIC Overtake on the outside. The swamps, the desert and the forest. Sounds like a typical safari to us! Again, the stages are all set on gravel, but due to the tropical weather conditions there's a lot of variation between tracks. The wet gravel is a lot harder to power-slide on. GRAVEL ASPHALT CHAMPIONSHIPERTON Watch out for strays! E CORSICA As close as you're going to get to a town level, Corsica is the first track you play on in arcade mode and in general, they are the easiest. Asphalt surfaces are commonplace so you have the chance to settle into the game with a little less hassle. Can FAIR WEATHER RALLY DRIVER Powerslide this corner! NEW ZEALAND No sheeps, but lots of rock hard tracks. New Zealand holds the hardest set of levels anywhere, with loads of small but really tight bends. Look out for the very impressive wooden bridge on one of the levels. Awesome graphical capabilities! + The rain falls vertically until you start to move, when it then shoots towards your screen, adding to speed factor! The hills are alive! STAGE OD OOO '&= FRENCH ALPS =3 The alps are possibly the most realistic of all the courses. Even though they are all on Asphalt, you have to take the snow falling level with extreme care otherwise you end up on your back all of the time. The courses are extremely tight too. Also detrimental to the way that V-Rally plays is the weather conditions. You know about snow needing a different set of tyres, likewise wet asphalt is also the time to call in the boys from Kwik Fit. The graphical superiority of this game really comes into effect when you hit one of the night stages. The lighting effects on your headlights are truly amazing, especially when you see the stage in replay mode. Only parts of the track within a couple of car lengths in front of you are exposed in your headlights, so you really do get the same feeling of uncertainty. f Your lights illuminate the cars in front at the start. The other vehicles don't have any headlights though. Doh! REVIEW Use extreme caution. STOL 090116 The only tracks where you need to equip the snow tyres, these are really tough! The icy conditions are hazardous even with the front wheel drive cars, and you have to race them numerous amounts of time to even come close to a perfect. As you can see from this shot, the headlights are very impressive. Use the outside view to make the most of them. Picturesque locations. "


"computer video games INSIDE AND OUT CRASH BANG WALLOP START 2 GAP OO ODOS bio bolo STARE 0021-4 GAP 00 00 OD PlayStation 1B17: As has become the norm with racing games, you're given a choice of two views to race under the inside and outside car view. Surprisingly, playing from the outside works well, as you get a greater awareness of what is around you and can avoid unnecessary collisions with other vehicles. But for a sheer feeling of speed and realism, the inside camera is unmatched. The game doesn't suffer from hideous pop-up either, so not only do you get a smooth ride, you get a damn quick one. A small word of warning though. If you are using the in-car view and happen to roll it, change to the outside view quick, otherwise there's a real danger you could get motion sickness. You can also flick instantly to a rear view by holding L2, which is handy for avoiding hits from behind after you crash. The main difference between V-Rally and Sega Rally is realism. SR is definitely an arcade title. One you can pick up and play instantly with no fear of crashing. Designed for fun only. V-Rally on the other hand incorporates a lot more simulation aspects into it. The weather conditions, the tyre changes, and two car types are some examples of the depth the game delves. And then of course you have the crashes. It maybe viewed as a fault, but it is incredibly easy to spin or stack your car. As soon as you clip the side of another car, or the side of the course, you lose all con trol and often a few vital seconds in the race. It may look spectacular, but it can prove annoying. Which is where the biggest incentive lies with V-Rally in that you are always striving to race a perfect lap without stacking it. And that takes a lot of practice! osia INSIDE ACCEPT NO IMITATIONS DE BEST BEST STAGE 00 22 40 SAP 00 00 40 OUTSIDE 97 GRAMPIONSHIP EDITION PEUGEOT ES50 EXPENGES ERSO MICHELIN H \"SERR3 1 The car in front is... err a Peugeot? Branding is commonplace on all of the vehicles and all the real-life sponsors get their little plugs as well. REAR Something Ocean are very pleased about with regards to this game, is that some of the tracks are modelled, exactly to real rally courses and settings. Although no official license is displayed, it features all of the real cars from rally tournaments, complete with all the sponsors. And can you believe that the current champion car is a Skoda?

The car is spinning over the track, caught in lots of time wasting rolls. By hitting the brake, he's stopped dead in the middle of the track, ready to rock. Step on the gas! REVIEW STAR 64 00 13.56 STAGE 02'01\" 12 GAP 0013 56 At first glance it may seem pretty weird having a handbrake in a game such as this, but once you think about it, it does serve a good purpose. When you press and hold the brake (R2) the car stops dead. If you are suffering the effect of a horrendous crash, the handbrake is often the best way to stop yourself. The problem is, that it resets you to wherever you are on the course, either on the track or off it. Time it right and you can save yourself some valuable seconds. ECAR And then there's the reverse effect. It's the same sort of situation spinning helplessly out of control as the cars whizz byand yet this time once the handbrake is activated, you drop into the trees on the roadside! 56 "

The third-generation PlayStation graphics are incredible. Great looking/ moving cars, and super-realis tic scenery put it visually way ahead of the (still) brilliant-looking Sega Rally. In another effort to beat the Saturn title, the wealth of tracks and the range of 'genuine' cars is astounding. In this respect, there is no con test-V-Rally is a more appealing game. It plays superbly too, but not, in my opinion, better than Sega Rally. The over-sensitive control-lose spoils the pace. I'd still give SR a Five now. Excellent as VR is, I don't think it's everyone's cuppa. TOM GULSE 123 94 \" SEAR 2. SERR If you're having trouble coping with the rigours complete a couple of laps, and when you begin of a competitive Rally, why not race against a third, a ghost car of your previous circuit will yourself? The best thing about the trial is that automatically appear for you to compare your you can select any of the tracks from the chamself against.

If I could give this 4.9 out of 5 I would. If we still did percentages, V-Rally would still get at least 90%. As it stands though, this isn't a revelation that warrants a High Five rating, simply because it won't appeal to everyone. Some will get annoyed by the ultra sensitive controls to begin with, which do need a lot of getting used to. Once mastered though, V-Rally becomes possibly the greatest rally game I have played. Comparisons are rightly drawn to Sega Rally, but I have to say I prefer Ocean's title. It has 45 tracks for a start, and that is not even with a cheesy mirror mode, Compare that to the four from SR and you're already way ahead. Even though V isn't as instantly accessible, it still offers a great deal of challenge and depth. But it's the graphics that set this apart from any of its competitors. The level of detail on the tracks is very impressive indeed and you can see so far into the distance without the huge amounts of pop-up that other games suffer from. Ocean have released a stormer of a game, that comes highly recommended. STEVE HED 110 SERR There are eight standard cars to race with. and they are all front wheel drive. The benefit from this is that they corner very well without much give when you're powersliding. However, they leave more than a little to be desired in the speed stakes. Which is where the four wheel drive cars come into play. There are an additional three four-wheel drive cars to choose and they are lightning quick compared to normal vehicles. The handling is razor-sharp though, and you end up powersliding around every corner REVIEW APOD OZ BATING RATING V-Rally wipes the floor with all other titles like this. It is as good as, if not better than, Sega Rally in many elements, and is definitely worth purchasing. 57 "

As well as figuring out exactly how to complete each stage there are literally hundreds of bonuses to find, including hidden levels, more vehicles, and extra money. It's also turned out to be one of the best games on the Nintendo 64 so far! JN Eh? What's this? I don't think we're in Kansas any more. 0/11 03:04.7 0 RP From the start of the level it's a race against the carrier! NCOMING ROCKETSI LOOK OUT BELOWI KRRKI MISSION COMPLETEI BZZTI BACKLASH From a vantage point on the top of a hill, you must use Ballista to shoot out the crates below! When not flying forward, J-Bomb relaxes in mid-air! 3. SHE'S GONNA BLOW! : YOUR MISSION, SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT... Some of the buildings can't be destroyed by the normal means of smashing into them with one of your vehicles. These buildings need to be taken down with the help of a box or two of TNT. Once a crate is touched it starts ticking and glowing to indicate how long is left before it blows, meaning that you need to rush with it to the target structure. The TNT crates are also useful for the speed vehicles such as the Police Car as they don't have the power to destroy buildings on their own. REVIEW Each level starts with a fly-by view of the area showing the path of the nuclear carrier, letting you know which buildings it is going to hit. You then need to jump into your vehicle and destroy anything in the path of the carrier by any means necessary. This often means that you need to find other vehicles and work out ways of saving the planet from the enormous explosion which will wipe everything out if you fail. As soon as you've cleared a safe path through the current area you can go to the truck at the end of the level and leave, or you can spend time searching around for hidden bonuses, meaning that there are loads of sub-objectives for each level on top of simply saving the carrier. 197324 DINGER YONE!

"computer DREAM MOBILES! Video games There are loads of controllable vehicles in Blast Corps, each one with different strengths and weaknesses. Each level has a set selection of vehicles, some of which are hidden in the area. You can switch between vehicles easily enough, by simply pressing the Z trigger to get out of one vehicle and running to the next. NINTENDO 64 YOU Although you spend most of your time inside the myriad vehicles, you can jump out by pressing the Z trigger. Normally this is only useful for swapping vehicles, but occasionally there are only areas accessible on foot. Ritimit DESTRUCTION VEHICLES These are the land-based vehicles that are best used for smashing down buildings, as well as getting around the rougher sections of the levels. RAMDOZER SPEED DEMONS A powerful bulldozer which can destroy most things in one go, simply by driving straight into them. It's also relatively fast, making it good for using on bonus stages which require buildings to be demolished quickly. These vehicles are best used on the time trial bonus stages, as they're very fast but not powerful enough to destroy buildings without pushing TNT crates. They all need to be discovered throughout the levels before they can be used. BACKLASH HOT ROD 1/11 02:56.7 011 RACKLASH A fast dumper truck which knocks down buildings by powersliding into them. While driving, hold the R shoulder button and turn sharply to go into a slide, then steer the back end into the scenery. Probably the fastest vehicle in the game, though it's extremely difficult to control. As soon as you turn it goes into a ridiculous powerslide, meaning that it takes lots of practice to get good with it. MERICAN DREAM BALLISTA RACING CAR 00:30,1 A speedy motorbike armed with rocket launchers! It can be a bit tricky to control at times, but being able to fire rockets by pressing the R button makes up for that. Ammo is often scarce, so you need to be careful not to waste it. Almost as fast as the Hot Rod, only with better handling. The Racing Car is also useful because it can go through some light barriers which stop most other vehicles. These often lead to secret bonuses and areas. SIDESWIPE POLICE CAR A luggage carrier which is difficult to control when in confined areas. Pressing the R shoulder button makes the panels on either side spring out and damage whatever you're next to. Similar to the Racing Car in that it's fairly fast and controllable, it can also go through most barriers. Holding the R button makes the lights flash and the siren sound for extra entertainment. REVIEW MINI VAN N 1/10 01:13.6 00:16.5 02:35.4 SKYFALL A fairly fast buggy which can use turbos by pressing the R button. To destroy buildings with Skyfall you need to find a ramp, turbo up it, and fall onto your target! A gauge in the bottom corner of the screen shows your remaining turbo power. Totally based on the A-Team van, this is fast and controllable, plus it's tough enough to do fair amounts of damage to buildings. Pressing the R button makes the driver shout \"Get outta mah way!\" @ "


"computer video games HYPER ROBOTIC SUITS CG BONUS LAND-BASED VEHICLES In case you didn't realise, this is a video game so the vehicles in Blast Corps don't have to be totally realistic. Rare have included some fantastic robot suits which you can use to flatten any buildings in your way. These aren't normally classed as vehicles as they don't show up on the world map, but you still get to control them every now and then. NINTENDO 64 THUNDER FIST PLATFORM CRANE A big silver robot with one arm missing. Pressing the attack button makes him roll along the floor, then jump and punch upwards with his other giant fist! It's possible to take out large sections of buildings when used properly. Running into the base of the crane gives you control of the moving platform. It's often used to lift vehicles and objects around the level to sections you wouldn't normally be able to reach. J-BOMB TRAIN 0/15 3:51.3 02:19. 1 Probably the most entertaining of all the vehicles, J-Bomb has massive jets on its back. Using these you can fly high above the level, then dive feet-first onto whatever you want to destroy! Very powerful and lots of fun! The train is used to move vehicles from station to station. When you drive it up to a platform, a small smiley face appears in the corner of the screen to let you know when you're stopped in just the right place. CYCLONE SUIT BOAT u 3/10 02:15.2 US The Cyclone Suit isn't anywhere near as big as the other two robot suits, but can still do a lot of damage. Pressing the attack button makes it go into a cartwheel then backflip, destroying whatever it comes into contact with. Like the train, the boat is often used to move vehicles around. There are also numerous occasions where boats need to be placed correctly to allow the carrier and yourself across waterways. GET THE PERFECT BONUS! On top of clearing a path through the level for the carrier, there are lots of other things to do on each level. Complete a level to a decent level and you're awarded a bronze medal. Earning the silver and gold medals takes a bit more work, as you need to search the level thoroughly to find every last one of the items mentioned here. It's possible to leave and enter any level at any time, meaning that you can play through the game slowly getting gold medals on each level, or you can fly through to see every level as quickly as possible then go back later to collect all the medals. COMMUNICATION POINTS BACKLASH These satellite dishes are often hidden inside buildings or in hard-to-reach areas. Touching them sends a signal which opens up another level on the world map. The stats screen for each level shows how many Communication Points you've found for that stage. RDUS REVIEW ALL THE BUILDINGS In your quest to get perfect gold medals on every level, finding and destroying every structure in the game is essential. You only need to clear the essential buildings to save the carrier, but clearing the entire level earns you another 100% bonus which goes towards your gold medal. These little lights are placed in the ground around the stage, usually to give a clue as to the best route through the level. When you drive your vehicle over them (or get very close at least) they light up orange. There are 100 of them on every level, and lighting every last one of them counts towards getting the overall 100% rating needed to get the gold medal. This sometimes takes a while, as big clusters are often hidden away together. SURVIVORS 30/9 00:55.9 00:20.1 These aren't so much of a problem to find as the other items, as they are only ever inside buildings. When you destroy a building containing survivors, they run out into the open where they are collected by your friendly helicopter. Getting them all gives you another 100% bonus. 60 "


"* IT'S NOT ALL SMASH, SMASH, SMASH! G: SAVE THE SCIENTISTS! computer video games Bonus levels open up either when you complete a certain \"standard\" level, get promoted, or find the right Communication Points. They are different from the normal game levels as they don't have the carrier to protect instead they involve completing set challenges in a strict time limit. Medals are awarded depending on the time taken to complete the stages the target times which have been set by Rare for each medal are perfectly worked out to provide a challenge to everyone, while still being in the realms of possibility. There are six scientists hidden in various levels around the world map, and finding them all gives you an extra section of the game. Each scientist gives you a clue to finding the next one, and as they are all well hidden any help comes in handy. We really don't want to ruin the surprise for you, but there's definitely more to the game than just the levels you see on the world map. NINTENDO 64 197400 02:51 0/6 01:3.5 0/21 FINISHL 1 LAPS  AUTAS 80 SRCUNS Many of the bonus levels have three or four-lap time trial races against the clock. You get to race against a ghost image of your previous best time. A few of the bonus On this stage you have levels involve driving to push the triangle of around a maze, lighting all boxes of TNT into the six the RDUS while avoiding the corner pockets to clear the other vehicles. These are giant snooker cues out of somewhat familiar... the way! INDING ABORTED! 0/11 2013 At one point in the game you'll come across six levels in a row featuring the J-Bomb. These are similar to the jetpack stages in Pilotwings 64! to get the gold medal on this stage, you need to wipe out all the buildings in only a few seconds, following the red arrows on the floor! It takes practice! Some bonus stages are made harder by being remote-controlled. The view stays fixed while the vehicle you're controlling goes off into the distance! I TOLD THEM I WANTED A NICE SAFE OFFICE JOB. DRIVNG A DELICATE NUCLEAR MISSLE ANT MY DEA OF SAFE REVIEWER RELIVE YOUR MOMENT OF GLORY! Once you've completed a level (or failed miserably) you get to see it again from an excellent angle right on top of the cab of the deadly carrier! Unfortunately, not as much has been made of the replays as we'd hoped, but it's still great to see yourself skidding around smashing buildings from right under the camera at the last minute! EEKI GET THEM COPS OUTTA THE WAY QUICK, SKYFALLI CLEAR A PATH PRONTOI The idea of smashing down buildings is one which surely appeals to most games players, though it's not something that's going to last long before it gets boring. This is where Blast Corps is a pleasant surprise, as it's got a lot more to it than just destruction. The levels are brilliantly worked out, and can be played at many different levels beginners can take a few goes to work out how to finish the level, while experts can spend ages searching thoroughly to get the coveted gold medal. The bonus stages provide a lot of variety, and have target times which are worked out perfectly so that they always seem possible, but just out of reach. There's also a LOT of game here with over 70 levels to find and complete, as well as more levels and some brilliant surprises once they're finished. On top of all that, the game saves all your best times for each level to give you and your friends something to play against. In fact, Blast Corps is more like the sort of thing I had come to expect from Nintendo than most of their own N64 releases so far a big, entertaining game world which changes as the player progresses, always surprising and giving new reasons to keep playing. It's great fun, and is big and tough enough to satisfy even serious gamers after a lasting challenge. 6D LOMAS RESS START PRESS BLAST CORPS GOES PLATINUM! After completing and getting gold medals on all of the levels and bonus stages on the world map, then completing the extra section you get by discovering all the scientists, the Platinum Time Trial challenge becomes available. You then need to enter levels again and complete them before a very strict time limit runs out to get the level marked with the platinum medal. These challenges aren't just \"rock hard\" they're far tougher than that! REVIEW . SUMIAN ACTRES RATING  See that? SKYFALL That's a IN NEW WEST platinum medal.

Battery-powered trolleys that old grandads run you over in!!! Maybe the thought of Actua Golf 2 will get you excited instead! AMA  GOLF 2 aulff' as the Americans call it, is a strange game. The older you get, the more you seem to like it. It must be like a time release gene inside your body, that as soon as you hit forty you suddenly feel the urge to buy a pair of plus fours, a tartan beret and little furry animals to put on the tops of your clubs, to wander around the English countryside shouting 'Fore!' whenever something bad happens. These days though, with the advances in modern technology (ie a PlayStation), you no longer have to leave your house to view the delights of golf. When Gremlin released Actua Golf, an unprecedented level of realism was reached within the ever popular market. With the second, not only have they added six new courses, but a wealth of shots and even another commentator! Now if only they could get the 19th hole going...    !RELIVE THE RYDER CUP   COURSES AG2 features a grand total of six new courses, three of which are modelled on actual professional courses. Those who recognise their golfing circuits will remember that Kiawah Island was the setting for the 1991 Ryder Cup in which Bernhard Langer missed the last putt on the final green to win it for Europe. Carnoustie, a Scottish Links course that has just been selected to host the 1999 British Open, is another that is well known to fans. The trio is completed with The Oxfordshire, the venue for the B&H International Open. The other three are all fictitious courses, but are made up of some of the best holes from venues all over the world. 02 A GOL actua 1 AG2 has a new front end!

The game will automatically give you the ones that are applicable for each shot you take. Actua Golf 2 is one of those rare sports sequels that actually represents a good enough leap forward from the original to consider buying. Six new courses is not something to be sniffed at for a start. Kiawah Island is a very sandy course, with loads of bunkers, whereas the Carnoustie is situated in more woodland areas. The thing that grabs me about this version is the sheer playability. You really do get caught up in the action. Four player skins become tense affairs, and even the commentators rub it in after a particularly bad shot. Everything you possibly could want in a golf game is here, and that is all you need to know.

Two years ago it would have been hailed as amazing, now it is sadly left at the back of the starting grid. Not entirely without merit, this is a very tough game to complete. I'm not sure many will want to stick with what is a rather average game, to discover all the cars and course variations. The four player mode is another great idea, though things do get a bit jerky. On the whole it's one to avoid, there are already loads of great racing games on the PlayStation, Rally Cross just isn't one of them. A difficult learning curve, and pretty unforgiving game play.

Yanoman Games presents en Naito, the legendary creator of Landstalker became disillusioned last year. Disturbed by the lack of sales for his brilliant Dark Saviour on the Saturn he decided to make a game that would appeal to the mass market. He saw the light in the form of a driving game. He was quick to point out that there are loads of driving games already available, but Runabout would be different. The game is set around city streets and coastal roads, heavily populated areas, and full of traffic. The game takes a free form of driving, with no set route to get to the goal. Weave around traffic, take ninety degrees turns into streets, and most importantly find shortcuts!

When you're driving a coach or lorry the perspective is viewed from a higher angle. BREAKING THE LAW There are four courses to choose from in Runabout. Three make up the game proper, set around the city in different areas. Each level is not a course or a stage however, these are missions! The first mis sion is DOWN TOWN set around the streets of Chinatown. The second mission takes you to the SEA SIDE, the final mission is METRO CITY, where the night time setting and busy streets make for an action packed finalé. The fourth course is the test circuit, useful for putting each vehicle through its paces. \"Why are the levels missions?\" you may ask. It's because you've been hired to steal some very valuable artifacts. Each mission requires you to acquire different items before making your way to the pick-up point. A racing game with an adventure element? You betcha! Told you this game was different! Nearly every object in the game is breakable. Not the majority of buildings though there are a few choice shopping malls to wreck. Every breakable object is allotted a value to its worth. So wreck a road sign and the score is $400, window $5,000, telephone box $10,000 and police car $100,000. Unfortunately, your vehicle is susceptible to damage as well. Create too much destruction and your car will start spouting flames, and pretty soon Lit's game over. Instead you have to be selective, wrecking objects that have a higher dollar value.

Runabout is up there with the best on the PlayStation, coming very very close to knocking Rage Racer off its podium. It really is that good! Four long courses, 22 very different vehicles, and some neato surprises make this a very attractive game apart from the graphics. While not visually brilliant looking, the speed of the game is impressive, coming very close to Rage Racer again. The choice, playability and original ideas are the game's saving grace. With cars all performing how you'd expect, each posing a different challenge. While you might see nearly everything the game has to offer on the first day (which racer is different?) you'll definitely come back for more. There is still room for improvement, but that's no bad thing since this spin on the racing genre is still very young. The only downer is that there isn't an official release date vet.

Hung up its boots and opted for increased levels of stress, loss of hair and failed transfers. None FIFA eing a football manager has to be one of the most high risk, stress induced jobs going, especially if you manage the England Team. Terry Venables came in for a load of stick over his handling of the team during the now infamous 'dentist's chair'incident. The team then goes on to restore national pride, subsequently increasing sales of anything alcoholic by 100% and everybody has forgotten about it. Had the team failed, Venners' head would have been on a stick, or a least superimposed to that of a turnip. Although FSM cannot recreate the tabloid hell for you as a manager, you still have all the daily running of the club at your disposal. Everything from making sure the pitch is of a playable standard, down to punishing players for not sticking to curfews, is your responsibility. Have you got the bottle to stick at it?

Bringing in the bargain basement players and nurturing them through the years not only saves you pots of money, but also shows you have a good eye for the discount team members. Spending loads on importing a foreign player could also cost you dear because, if he fails, you have a huge trans fer fee to try and earn back. FIFA Manager features a new idea for these games, in that you can have a transfer hot list. Any players you particularly want in your team can be added to this, then every month or so it automatically bids for the player in question. He'll then either accept, or say he's been flattered by the interest but is happy where he is. 330,818 Gifts Winnings Third Party Another part of the game that is pretty unique to FIFA Soccer Manager is that all of the clubs have their own stadiums in the game. Right the way down the Goldstone Ground Brighton, all the details are there. The actual stands are true to life as well, of which Old Trafford is the best example. They have been created in the old isometric FIFA style and because of this, upgrades can be added to your stadia. Once you're inside the upgrades section of the game, you can view any small section of the stand and upgrade it, or add corners to the existing structures to make the ground completely rounded.

McCoist The club is not generating enough income through merchandise and gate receipts to cover expenditure on player wages and transfer fees. You are going to have to pay close attention to finances before you slip irreversibly into debt. 4% All your decisions have been made, the players are out on the pitch, and all you can do is wonder whether you've made the right decisions. The good news for you is that you can watch your players as they battle, through the league. You are given two options before each match, one is to generate the outcome so all it does is give you the score instantly. The second is to watch the whole match. This can become quite tedious, but you can double the speed to reduce this. The camera can be switched to any of four angles and an overhead view if you fancy a Sensible Soccer style game. Unfortunately, we were unable to get any shots of this, so you'll just have to take our word for it. D 1 The pitch on the right shows who has been allocated what skill by little arrows and drawings.

The tabloids have a field day and you are forced to discipline him with a heavy fine and a two match suspension. Q UE OK 2 npton 2 2 2 5 What kind of preparation is that for a big match?! 19,000,000 139,807,664 499.999 THE Y-AXIS CUTS THE Z-AXIS I have to say that, after playing Premier Manager, this game just didn't give me the same level of enjoyment. I didn't feel as if I had the same level of control over what was going on as in PM. Because there is no choice of game, ie minimal or complete control, you are dropped straight in at the deep end. Every time I started a new game was losing money, as soon as the second week of the season. I put the ticket prices down in order to attract more punters, but the same number of people turned up. I tried to buy a big name player, but had to get a loan and so I was in even more debt. The vicious circle of management or just annoying? Little things like instructing full backs to play the long ball game, and all they did is run with it until they were tackled frustrated me immensely. And no matter how I set up the team, loads of formations and strategies, we always lost! Even with teams like Rangers who should be dominating their league! It's still a good management sim but seeing as there are so many different, and better variations of this game, you'd be better off going for one of those. STEVE HEY Monthly interest 02.083 M y Payment Loin duration For all the statistically minded out there, EA have replaced the pages of numbers and opted for a slightly easier-on-the-eye graph system.

Engage and destroy drones using plasme cannon only. espite EA having continued success with the sales of their recent big name titles, the specialist press are fast losing their patience with the endless sequels. The old EA magic that saw them become one of the top publishers over the last few years is fading, but with titles like Moto Racer and FIFA Soccer Manager on the horizon, and the gaining of the Lost World license, the critical acclaim could soon be returning. Darklight Conflict is their latest game to be converted from PC to PlayStation and if it's only competition is EA's other title Wing Commander IV, the war is over. Barklght Con FLCT I'LL TAKE YOUR BRAIN TO ANOTHER DIMENSION! The links between you and each of the stage, where the object is to avoid as many stages come in the form of Hyperspace of the coloured energy blasts as possible. Portals.

The heavy to guarantee infecting artillery weapons leave them with the virus bomb. satisfying explosions. 0 0 The orange bolts shown right, actually replenish your energy once they hit you, so try to fly into as many as possible, thus filling your bar! 3 THE ANGLE OF THE DANGLE Leste eneste REVIEWER You are given three views to play under in Darklight. One is an arcade-style-behind-the-ship view and another is like a television viewpoint, which rotates around the craft. Although both of these make for nice screenshots, they aren't practical for playing under. The most efficient is the inside, simulation view. There are three coloured triangles situated around the screen that are your biggest guide. The yellow one in the bottom left points towards any enemies on-screen. The green arrow at the top shows any of your targets that cannot fire back (like the barges or mothership), and the purple pointer indicates the whereabouts of the fellow Repton craft. Use these otherwise you'll become completely lost and incredibly bored. Lecite Oberges wirector CHICO To be honest, I think that these sort of games only work on PC. They seem to suit the market a lot more than consoles. And however hard the companies try to make them more arcade-esque, it never seems to work. Having said that, Darklight is the closest I've seen too almost getting it right. The graphics are very good with light-sourcing galore, that cannot fail to impress. And the game has very slick presentation with a highly polished feel. But when you actually get down to playing, that's where it loses the marks. For a start, the difficulty pitch rises from easy to rock hard in the space of one stage, which is strange. I also found myself regularly flying around empty spaces wondering where the next enemy was coming from. It can be good fun, but it's nowhere near great. STEVE PES REVIEW SUCKED ME RIGHT INI RATING Before you begin playing the real levels in Darklight, you have to go through ten training missions, each of which highlights a various tactic or weapon you need to master to progress. You learn how to use high-powered missiles and bombs, how to infect space barrages with a virus and how to use the tractor beam to take objects through the dimensional warp, among other things. BATINGU A very polished space combat game, which almost succeeds in getting the perfect balance between arcade and simulation. Almost. How locate and enter hypersece portelah pod. 70 "

You may be expecting a serious simulation from Extreme Assault, but it's very much an arcadestyle blaster. Set in the future, your helicopter and tank are both armed with fantastic weapons which make destroying the mysterious alien invaders lots of fun. Let's get out there a whup ET's ass! EXTREME VASSAULT EXTREME ASSAULT VEHICLES! VAXTREME There are two vehicles that you get to use during the six campaigns of Extreme Assault. Most of your time is spent in the helicopter, but some of the later missions require you to use the special tank to explore smaller areas. HELICOPTER * TANK The Sioux AH-23 attack helicopter is a futuristic helicopter armed with some fantastic weaponry. It's also very manoeuvrable and fast, and great fun to fly. You can play from inside the 3D cockpit with the ability to look all around, or from one of many external views. The T1 tank isn't like any tank we've ever seen before. For a start, it can move sideways as it hovers instead of running on tracks like the tanks we're used to. The turret can be raised or lowered at any time, and it has all the same weapons as the Sioux AH-23 helicopter. GORGE GRAPHICS! Extreme Assault's graphics are particularly brilliant, and use lots of fancy effects not often seen in PC games. The developers are especially proud of their PlayStation-style translucent effects and the way that the whole thing looks so good without any accelerator cards. The models of the main vehicles and enemy ships are brilliantly detailed, plus there are some excellent little touches throughout, like the clock tower in the first village having the current time on its face!

"CAMPAIGNS FOR NUCLEAR ARMAMENT computer video games Each level starts with a mission briefing shown on the monitor inside your vehicle's cockpit. There are four pilots to choose from at the start of the game, each representing a different difficulty. On Easy level you can only play the first two campaigns, while the top setting lets you go through all six with more difficult enemies than usual. At the start of the game, you are called to clear areas of enemies attacking small villages, but an alien invasion soon becomes clear! ROM 902 The Fire Flash weapon is really impressive and can destroy most enemies in a single shot. From the outside view it looks amazing! Near the start of the game, you defend small villages from attacking armies. Before long you're discovering and exploring alien bases deep inside a volcano! Problems around a ruined ancient village. 20TR4 FORTRESS DEFENSESE A remote enemy installation in the snowy mountains! WELL TOOLED UP! When you get a warning to let you know that a guided missile has been launched, switch to the external view and try to shake it off! Plus it looks really flash! VAXTREME Your main weapons are the Razor Gun and Laser of each weapon, so keeping ammo levels high is Cannon. These each have gauges in the top very important throughout the game. A Razor Gun left-hand corner of the screen to show how much with maximum ammo fires multiple shots very ammo they have remaining. The gauges have quickly, while one low on ammo fires single shots three sections to them which indicate the power very slowly. That's easy enough to understand. REVIEWER RAZOR GUN The Razor Gun is the weapon you're likely to use most often. When fully armed it fires lots of tiny homing shots very quickly, making it excellent for catching moving enemies. LASER CANNON FIRE FLASH The Laser Cannon fires slowly Although you don't have this but is more powerful than the until a few campaigns into the Razor Gun. Because of its game, it's very powerful indeed. feeble firing rate, it's best used Holding the fire button charges against fixed targets which can't the weapon, then it fires lightshoot back. ning bolts straight out the front! HD While Extreme Assault looks like it could be a serious helicopter simulation, it's really a long way from being one. Instead it's almost non-stop futuristic action all the way, with plenty of strategy and skill involved. The game looks brilliant when running on a high end PC (there are options to lower the detail and resolution instantly while playing if the frame rate gets a bit low during the game) with excellent effects, detailed items and some spectacular scenery. Flying the helicopter itself takes a bit of practice, but before too long you'll be able to do whatever you want with it, and the same goes for the tank. The missions themselves are excellent, with loads of variety and an entertaining plot which develops as you get further into the game. There's always something to do, with bonus points awarded for finishing levels quickly plus hidden sections containing power-ups for those who take time to search for them. Extreme Assault is a fast, fun strategy blast which will be lapped up by PC owners after a bit more action than the usual flight sims. Very good indeed. au REVIEW \" 60 LOMAS RATING | ** GUIDED MISSILE The Guided Missiles are fairly common, and very useful against the larger enemies.

As the destructive fun makes its internet debut! ROM hh, Bomberman, Bomberman, how do we love thee, let us count the ways. Over the years the explosive fun has been experienced by so many. Now with his return to the PC, the pyromaniac is about to start a world war. Atomic Bomberman allows players from all over the globe to blast each other to smithereens, all from the comfort of their own home. No more being the best B-man among a group of friends. Now you can be Champion of the World! Take on Klaus from Stuttgart, Nicole from Lyon, Riki from Helsinki and many more. Perhaps the UN should referee? WBERMAN YOU TALKING TO ME? O DON'T I KNOW U. WE YOU FROM ATOMIC SOMEWHERE? CLASSIC Bomberman talks! It had to happen sooner or later, and now it has. The B-man is now equipped with verbal put-downs and taunts. These are for the real show off players, who spend as much time talking as bombing. There is also different dialogue for when B-man is in near-death situations. Such as if he has been trapped by a bomb. Or if he has been detonated he will utter some last words. The voice talent behind Tiny Toons and VO the voice of Stimpy from Ren & Stimpy provide all the dialogue. LAAN BOMBERMAN It's Bomberman, but not as we know it! Cute is out, Robosuits are in. Bah humbug! \"What have they done to the Earth?\" cried Michael Jackson. When you see what Kinesoft have done to Bomberman you may also feel the need to cry to. Atomic features classic and enhanced modes of play. Classic is the regular battle mode, with a standard range of power-ups. Enhanced makes full use of the rendered graphics, by allowing you to see what power-up each bomber is carrying. In both modes Bomberman looks a little beefed up compared to how we've seen him before. Looking taller, plus he seems to be wearing a suit that makes him look like a robot. REVIEWER THE KILLER DISEASE OS 10 player! But the stages are too small. Lots of new power-ups appear through the game, including a hover scooter, armour and super gun. Strangest of the lot is an even more deadly skull than the standard cranium. This time it's called Ebola! This special skull contains an even deadlier curse than before. Whereas the standard skull gives you one ailment, ebola can give up to three! This can sometimes result in controls being reversed, extra slow speed and bomb runs! Talk about deadly! Bomberman has always been one of the simplest games in existence, which is where its main appeal lies. It's cute. addictive, no-nonsense fun where gameplay is king. Atomic Bomberman doesn't seem to realise any of these points, which is why I find it such a mess. Lucky Hudson Soft for they weren't responsible for this version! The speech is plain annoying, immature and not funny. The graphics don't retain the feel of the original games, plus there's far too much slowdown. There's no one-player game, only a battle mode, and no highten mode like the Saturn version. This means if you're having a ten-player battle, the game takes place in a standard sized arena. 'What have they done' has been the general response from all in the office, a genuine chorus of disapproval. For PC owners starved of B-man thrills, this still plays alright but nowhere near great. Alex A TALA BOMB SKULL EBOLA FLAME JELLY GLOVE GOLD TR REVIEW KICK PUNCH SKATES TRIGGER BATING O UDU SESE Attaching the Bomberman name to this game is almost a crime. All that remains is the idea. Saturn Bomberman had all the right improvements, this doesn't. It's that simple.  "

"computer video games 22124 PS 858 PRESS START PLATFORM SHOOTER BY SNK  PRICE IMPORT  NEO GEO AND ARCADE VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY SEGA TEL EIMPORTER TM SEGA SATURN OUT NOW (IMPORT) 1-2 PLAYERS CVG delves into the import scene to bring you one of the most entertaining titles in recent months. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Metal Slug. CREDLT 00 CREDITS 05 ven though there is a shortage of British Saturn titles at the moment, the import scene is hotting up. With games like Last Bronx, Sonic R (the Sonic racing game), Resident Evil and Sonic Jam starting to emerge in the Far East, the similar tale of quality not quantity appears to be the motto for Sega. Metal Slug may not be one of the big name titles but it is still a classic platform shooter, that represents a return to the sprite-based days. There is no real plot behind this game just some madman who has threatened to blow up the Earth and all that. You can expect loads of over the top weapons, mindless destruction and wanton killing, and that is just the first stage! If only all reminiscing could be as fun as this. 031 098 57 FROM HERE TO KINGDOM COME One of the most satisfying things about Metal Slug are the calibre given to you by the hostages you save. Some of the power-ups are of weapons you can pick up during the course of the game. They are also stashed in crates that you need to shoot open. collected by simply picking up the small lettered icons that are HOWINAMISSUECAME THROWER) ROCKETS ( BLAST GUN The Hicon is the most common weapon you'll pick up. You get 200 when you pick up the icon but their rather rapid rate of fire means that you lose them quickly. Produces a rather amusing death scene in which the recipient waves their arms in agony as they're consumed by the flames. Always worth a laugh in our book! These rockets not only pack in a mean punch, but they home in on enemies as well. They are even more effective when used to shoot baddies above or below yourself. The best and funniest weapon of the four, this literally blasts the enemies to pieces once fired, leave ing a blood explosion as well. Hold onto them for a long as possible. 54 PRESS START 47 628 2017 GREITS CREDITS 05 SCISE ME COMING THROUGH REVIEW e n er 54 PRESS START Every soldier gets a little battle weary from time to time, so the troopers from MS have the advantage of being able to jump into the namesake tank of this game, the Metal Slug. This futuristic style tank is the perfect way to mow down any number of ground troops while destroying buildings in the process. The Slug has it's own energy bar at the top of the screen and can take four hits before it blows. Collecting any gas canisters will give you back a quarter of the energy as well. It also has a rotating gun turret on its side that can shoot in any direction, but the disadvantage is that the gun mode is in tandem with the direction you move in. If you drive forwards, the gun rotates to face the direction you're travelling in. The Slug can also be triggered as some sort of megabomb where you jump out and it explodes killing all around. Do this by pressing A, B and C together once you're inside it. 76 "


"computer Video games MONSIEUR, MONSIEUR! CUT THAT MUTHA RIGHT THERE! 58 Bonus points are awarding in Metal Slug for rescuing the POWS trapped inside the various levels. To save one, you have to first shoot or slash the ropes caging them and quickly run along and catch them before they run away. They then whip out a cape and drop a power-up or points bonus before saluting you and running off. The game keeps a count of how many you've rescued for each stage and gives you bonus points for them at the end. If you lose a life during the level though, all the hostages you've collected up until then will be discarded, and you have to start collecting again! For added blood value, there is also a close combat weapon available to the good guys. It doesn't require any special buttons to activate, as all you have to do is get close to an opponent and hit the attack button. Your character then whips out a knife and slashes the foe resulting in a lovely squirt of blood and a corpse. Excellent! CREDES 03 CREDITS EREDIT 1 These three hostages have all been shot free and will wander around until you touch them again, after which time they drop a bonus for you. They can't be shot dead though. 1 One swish of the knife and the foe is spitting blood! Dare you stand in my way! 199592 ANSSONE BODLONA sa PRESS START 50 56 PLEASE WAIT WHAT DO POINTS MAKE? 4? 30 1931 53 3 6 58 PRESS START CREDITS 02 CREDITS THE ANIMATION GAME REDITS DE The most impressive thing about Metal Slug is the animation. The game will not run unless you have the RAM cartridge, but the effects are very recognisable. There are so many little details like the crewman jumping a sinking ship holding their noses, while their colleagues desperately try to bail out water that really add to the feeling of the game. You can see the characters breath on the snow levels, and flies buzz around the dead fish on the first stage. Keep an eye out for these little quirks, as they can be quite amusing. There are tons of little details in Metal Slug that you never end up noticing until the third or fourth time you play it. Shooting the helicopters releases certificates that give you more points. Also, on the second level, once you reach the section where the enemies parachute in from above you, shoot the points-switch on the floor and once the enemies are dead, shoot it back the other way to gain a 5000 bonus. Nothing major, but interesting all the same. 437548857 300 55 PRESS START REVIEWER 1P3 FREDIT BREOTT and You can't go wrong with this sort of game. It's non-stop action from start to finish and is one of the few games you actually enjoy simply playing. Sure it is simple in theory and it's far too easy to complete. You can still pick it up and waste half an hour blasting seven bells out of people and feel satisfied at the end of it. The two-player mode is also a really good laugh, with the action teetering on the brink of chaotic at times. And it's games like this that show you that just because we've moved into the 32-bit era dominated by polygons, sprite-based games can still work well. As yet, we're still unsure whether this is going to get an official release, but anyone who has access to Japanese machines will have a ball playing this. Top laffs all round! STEVE HEY CREDITS 03 AND FINALLY REVIEW The last word must go to the pig who turds. Yes, if you successfully manage to shoot one of the shop fronts on the fourth level, you'll see a little pig standing on a ledge. Stand and watch him for a moment and you should see him let out a nice runny dump. Does it get much better than that? RATING Shock!!! Horror!!! 2D game gets praise in games mag. Metal Slug is blood, action, weapons and pure enjoyment on a CD. Cool. 77 "


"computer video games SPACE COMBAT BY ORIGIN FULL GUNS  PRICE .99 PC VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED STORAGE 4CDS RELEASED BY EA TEL 01753 549442 3 IMREC TM OUT NOW 1 PLAYER PlayStation PlayStation COMMUNICATION Never before have such a fine collection of actors been cast together in an epic like this.* Grab your popcorn and get ready for Wing Commander IV! * We don't think WINGXOMMANDER IV f you think about it with an open mind, you could say that EA's delay in releasing Wing Commander IV is a stroke of marketing genius. Compare its launch on PlayStation to the release of the Star Wars Trilogy films, and even Shadows of the Empire for N64. All Star Wars related, and WCIV has the lead character of the Star Wars Trilogy in the main role! Brilliant! All they need to do is splash the words 'Mark Hamill' all over their ads and WCIV will instantly gain attention! Now if only they could add the words «stars in the most fantastic space combat game ever\" underneath and everything would be fine and dandy. Sadly that isn't the case... AIMING HIGH! S S S WING COMMANDER IV BS BS BS MONKEY ISLAND IT AIN'T! Even though Wing Commander IV is essentially FMV based, you still have some say in what goes on. And when you climb into the cockpit of the Hellcat, you are thrust headlong into a real time battle. The wealth of controls available may prove confusing to begin with. Most you won't even use, like the smart targeting, or rear view. Really, shoot and accelerate are all you need. To give you an extra helping hand, every enemy has a small target preceding its flight path, showing you exactly where to shoot. Not only that, if you are firing close enough to the point, the lasers home in automatically! Considering the amount of FMV in this game, it's probably a wise idea that the programmers added a few plot twists for you. At certain points in the footage you are given a couple of responses or questions to choose from, with the subsequent clips altering depending on your decision. For instance, when you're sitting in the bar at the beginning of the game, two guys come crashing through the door. You are given the choice to get up and sort out the disturbance, or sit there and mind your own business. Ahh decisions, decisions... SPARK Doesn't this look fun! REVIEWER I love To Set my hande en te weiver helt If I wanted to watch a movie on my PlayStation, I'd buy WCIV. If I wanted some entertainment to go with that movie, I'd buy a video for a tenner, and spend the rest on a Platinum title. The problem with a game like WCIV is that there is hardly any game to speak of. After hours of FMV which, in all fairness, is very entertaining, and finding something I could play, I was overcome by boredom. In-game graphics are ropey, and jerk about all over the place. The space craft are pixelly, and the fiddly controls ruin any short term appeal WCIV may have had. STEVE PES 1 This is actually a shield on the ship. Not that you care, REVIEW see I NEVER FORGET A FACE! eeee BATING OOUUU RATING The fact that this game contains quite a few well known actors has been well documented. You all know about Mark «Feel The Force Luke!\" Hamill, but what about some of the others. Well, there is Tom \"make like a tree and get outta here\" Wilson from Back to the Future fame. John Rhys-Davies who gained his star status from Indiana Jones and Malcom \"viddy well, little bruvver\" McDowell, who you may have seen in such films as Star Trek: Generations and Clockwork Orange. Now you know. Wing Commander IV proves that this sort of game is only suited to PC, and is in no way suited to the PlayStation. It feels as though the days of Mega CD are returning. 78 "

"computer video games NINTENDO 64 NINTENDO FIGHTING WINS OJI RAN PUSH START KABAL MORTAL KOMBATTRLOGY OUT NOW CHE BY WILLIAMS 1-2 PLAYERS he best home Mortal Kombat game so far has been Mortal Kombat Trilogy on the PlayStation. It carried across all the elements that make the arcade version so enjoyable, but unfortunately the same can't be said for the Nintendo 64 conversion. For a start it loses out on a load of characters the four bosses, four \"classic\" character variations, and even regular Sub-Zero are left out. The graphics are also poor, with masses of animation cut out, making the characters jerk about all over the place. The sound is particularly terrible, and the game itself becomes very difficult to play with the standard N64 joypad. I'm sure that the problem here isn't entirely the N64 cartridge's lack of storage space it's the absence of any kind of effort on the part of the developers. Don't waste your time with this. ED LOMAS  PRICE .99  PLAYSTATION VERSION AVAILABLE  SATURN VERSION PLANNED STORAGE 6 MEG CART  PUBLISHED BY GT INTERACTIVE  TEL 0171 258 3791 \"Rmmnf wnnsf! Ffnalityf!\". The sound in N64 MKT really adds to the gloomy atmosphere (lie). RACING SALE 1999 Playstation RAY TRACERS 1600 HALILAR ta I'L\" TM PlayStation AUG RELEASE BY TAITO TINE BI 1 PLAYER Run AILI ay Tracers is truly an arcade-style driving game. You're racing against the clock, trying to catch the enormous enemy vehicles at the end of each level. Along the way there are plenty of other cars which can be bashed into until they explode, giving you loads of points. You car reaches extremely high speeds in only a few seconds, and keeping it under control while dodging obstacles and flying over jumps is excellent fun. The graphics are also brilliant, even though they don't look so hot when still the lighting and shadow effects are particularly good.

Once on board you learn of the murder of longtime friend Tyler Whitney. Solve the mystery of his murder, and more importantly stay alive. On board are all manner of passengers, each more mysterious than the last. The Last Express is a very lavish game and the attention to detail is incredible, creating the illusion of pre-war Europe. The characters are believable and well acted, even speaking their respective languages perfectly. The train itself has been modelled on original blueprints. It's just a shame it all ends too soon. There are multiple endings, and plenty to do once on board, but not much room for error.

It's based on the three year old Trek movie that saw Jean-Luc and James T. united on screen for the first time and follows the plot of the movie almost scene for scene. You play different characters from the Enterprise as they go about their duty to stop the evil Soran. As Riker you must embark on away missions, as Data you aide the Captain in Stellar Cartography. As Picard you must command the ship in battles against Romulans and Klingons. All the cast of the movie have been invited back to participate in the game to provide the voices for their in-game characters. The result is a very polished game.

Its high-adrenalin, all-out action makes it totally terrifying. And the gruesome graphics are chilling! However, it also harbours many secrets. Different routes and vital LIFE-UPS. Here we reveal all, complete with official maps from Sega. If you haven't discovered HotD yet, maybe this tour of the mansion will quicken your blood! KEY BRIDGE DESCRIBES THE AREA YOU'RE IN. THIS INDICATES A ROUTE JUNCTION. SIGNIFIES A ROUTE LEAVING THE MAP. SIGNIFIES A ROUTE JOINING THE MAP BOSS SHOWS YOU WHERE THE BOSS IS! STAGE 1 MANOR GROUNDS MANOR HOUSE-GROUND FLOOR MANOR HOUSE WATERWAY BRIDGE 1 JUNCTION 1 On entering the opening courtyard there are two scientists fleeing from attacking zombies. Save the scientists and you proceed more swiftly to the fountain. If either scientist dies you face more zombies. There's no real change in your route, so this junction isn't that important, but you want to save the scientists for more life bonus. MANOR GROUNDS 3 JUNCTION 3 In the entrance Hall of the manor house you are attacked by two monkey zombies. Shoot the right monkey and you follow the left monkey upstairs to the first floor (leads to J6). If you shoot the left monkey then you proceed straight ahead through the double doors smashed open by a zombie (leads to J4). FOUNTAIN HOUSE OF THE DEAD PLAYER'S GUIDE! COMMENT ON J3 \"If you aren't pushed into the courtyard, going upstairs is the easiest way to get to the BOSS. plus the next scientist you save yields an LIFE-UP. However, the other route is more exciting. 2 JUNCTION 2 Approaching the bridge front of the manor house, there's a zombie carrying a scientist. Kill it before the scientist is thrown over the side of the bridge. The scientist rewards you with a LIFE-UP and you proceed to the main entrance of the manor house. If you fail, you walk down to the WaterWay the only way to get to the Water Wheel Room (leads to J7). COURTYARD COURTYARD COMMENT JUNCTION 4 Proceeding down the Main Hallway you're stopped by a huge hole in the floor. As you turn around you're attacked by a zombie. If the zombie hits, you're pushed down the hole into the basement (see J7). If you kill the zombie, you go directly into the Cell Room (leads to Central Courtyard). \"If you head to the waterway, shoot the red barrel on the opposite side of the river (next to the zombie) to reveal a LIFE-UP!\" START COMMENT ON J4 \"Falling down the hole gives you a longer route to the BOSS with more opportunity to increase your score.\" BOSS STOREROOM ............

Shoot the rubble and it collapses allowing you to go up (leads to J6). If you don't shoot it, you must walk around the courtyard (leads on to storeroom). Going up the stairs is the easier route, as the path round the Inner Courtyard is fairly dangerous. ENTRANCE HALL GROUND FLOOR 3 "

STORE ROOM INNER COURTYARD BILLIARD ROOM COMMENT ON JUNCTION 6 \"This is you only way to the Billiard Room so unless you want to suffer damage from falling, kill that zombie. However, going via the Inner Courtyard is more challenging and offers a chance at a higher score.\" STEP 1. Hit that weakspot on his Chariot's chest. STEP 2. Strip off his flesh when he's exposed!

If he's killed, you go to the Circular Shaft (leads to J5). WATERWHEEL ROOM WEAK POINT! Chariot is a huge zombie clad in indestructible armour, however there is a hole in the armour over its right breast. Shooting anywhere but here is hopeless. You can tell when you hit because a sickly yellow fluid pours out. It's quite small, but he's slow moving. SEWER NOTE: This junction is only for those who have come from WaterWay. Those who have fallen through the hole are too late and the scientist has already been killed so you automatically go to the Circular Shaft. BASEMENT SEWER WATERWHEEL ROOM ATTACK! Chariot lumbers forward, attempting to get close enough to slash you with his huge battle axe. Only shooting his weak spot slows him. Just keep rapid-firing at it until all his armour flies off. Now start shooting all his flesh off. Start with the legs to stop him running, then hit the arms. Don't waste time shooting at any exposed bone. He soon keels over. WARNING! Bubbles are a sure sign that at any moment something is going to jump out of the water. In particular look out for the Ebitan-A (slime humans) and Buelu (frogs).

Shoot it and you proceed down a chute to the ground floor (leads to the Kitchen). If you ignore the trapdoor you go through the door (leads to J9). Going down the chute certainly gives a more claustrophobic experience of narrow winding corridors, compared to the usual open rooms. LABORATORY 1 BRIDGE WALKWAY JUNCTION 9 As you cross the walkway you can see a control panel on the opposite wall. If you shoot it, the walkway will lower to the first floor (leads to Kitchen). If you ignore it, you proceed to the Art Room. Going down is both the harder and the more interesting route. BOOKSHELVES BEDROOMS 10 HALL ART ROOM 10 JUNCTION 10 As you enter this decaying room, parts of the floor collapse. If you are then hit by a zombie you fall into the Bar below. Kill the zombie and you go to the Hall (where all routes join back up). It's best not to fall down as you both lose life and don't really get to see anything special.

"computer video games COMMENT ON J11 ARCADE There's no basic change in your route, but going straight across walkway does give the opportunity to battle something unusual! Going down gives you more shooting potential and a chance to raise your score, but is harder.\" BOSS HANGED 11 ACROSS WALKWAY LOCATION: The Hangedman appears in the air over a large central courtyard while you're walking along an outside walkway on the roof. WEAK POINT! The entire main body and head is susceptible to damage. You can tell when you hit because he flashes. To compensate for this he's really fast. ATTACK! The Hangedman is surrounded by an army of zombie bats (26 of them) known as the \"Devilon\". The devilons fly around Hangedman until ordered to swoop down and attack you in groups of 1,2 or 3. At first it's difficult to see which ones are attacking until they're fairly close. They only attack once each whether you kill them or they hit you. After Hangedman sustains half damage, all the remaining devilons drop from the sky (presumably dead) and he attacks. Hangedman first flies left to right, occasionally swooping in to strike with his claws. Once down to 25% damage he flies off and your character continues along the roof. However, without warning the Hangedman swoops down, knocking your character off the walkway. Before plummeting to his death, your character grabs the end of the roof with one hand and the attack continues. This time Hangedman prefers to soar up high in the sky and dive down at you. After diving it flies across the courtyard, occasionally flying up from directly below as well. Fire even when he's in the distance to win as quickly as possible. 11 UNDER WALKWAY 11111 PRESS START BUTTON STAGE 3 SECURITY ZONE 12 JUNCTION 12 In the final room of this area are two elevators.

Save the scientist and he gives you a security card to go through the door. If the scientist is killed he falls down the chute into the Duct Room. You then follow him to retrieve the security pass.

"DOME ZONE BOSS BOSS 3! HERMIT computer video games LIFT THE BIO ROOM LOCATION: In the strangely designed \"botanical\" room at the end of stage three, you meet Dr.Curian for the first time. As he makes his escape via a secret elevator your pursuit is halted by the Hermit. 14 JUNCTION 3 There are two entrances into the Dome Room. If you shoot the shutter across the left entrance then you proceed through the left entrance. Otherwise you proceed through the right entrance. WEAK POINT! The head is the only weak area with the armoured body and legs deflecting all bullets. Although its head is a fairly large target Hermit's legs often partially obscure it. You can tell when you hit because blood gushes out and the head flashes. LIFT DOME ROOM COMMENT ON J14 \"The left entrance is the easier route and most is also the most interesting. Only go right if you want more of a challenge!\" ATTACK: At first you are at the top of the elevator looking down. This gives you an advantage, because he simply climbs up and down the elevator shaft attacking with his front legs. His head is always bobbing back and forth, so learn to judge the timing of head. After one third damage, he retreats down the elevator shaft which changes from vertical to horizontal about 10-15 metres down. You follow Hermit who recommences his assault. Turning around, he fires web-balls from his backside. The web balls aren't particularly fast, so you do have time to reload. Miss them though and some obscure your vision, shielding Hermit's advance. After two thirds damage, Hermit attacks with his clawed legs. He doesn't retreat so far down the shaft when hit and quickly attacks again. This time he uses his front legs to shield his head while advancing. Rapid fire regardless to end this confrontation quickly.

Beat him and you move onto a large cavern wherein awaits Hangedman (the second boss). Beat him and you face a final corridor filled with crackling pillars of electricity. These do you no harm, but zombies do keep popping out. At the end of this, you see Dr Curien who leads you into the final chamber his secret laboratory! CLIFF BOSS 2 HANGEDMAN CONTROL ROOM BOSS 4 MAGICIAN BOSS 1 LOCATION: The Magician is released from the Bio-Reactor by Dr. Curian in the final secret laboratory, but escapes and goes outside onto a large balcony. CHARIOT FINAL AREA START WEAK POINT! The weak point blueprint says \"unknown', but look carefully and there are several easily recognised \"unfinished\" body areas that are vulnerable lower right leg, upper left arm etc. You can tell when you hit because he flashes. HIGH SCORES! ARCADE -200 ATTACK! First he flies around shooting energy-balls at you, sometimes only using one hand (for a double energy-ball attack) and sometimes using both hands (for a quadruple energy-ball attack). Use the motion blur to home in on Magician's movement, to damage him before he can shoot his energy-balls. Succeed and he pauses for a while a great opportunity for more hits. Do sufficient damage and the Magician's blur shadow changes from blue to red and he increases speed slightly. This time he only uses one enerTu gy-ball, but instead of shooting it at you, he comes right up close and smacks you with it. He's an easy target, so even if you take damage make him pay for it. After that he returns to the first attack pattern. Once nearing death, the Magician generates a large number of energy-balls, throwing them up and raining them down on you. He's quite far away, but doesn't move around while summoning up the energy-balls, so inflict a lot of damage. When the fireballs come down you need fast accurate shooting to take them all, before they hit. There are three endings in HotD. However the only way to see the true ending is to get 1st ranking (62,000). To help you out, these are the all-important point values, Each rescued scientist: +400 Each scientist killed by a monster: -100 Each scientist killed by you: Each monster killed: +80 Each time you shoot a monster's head: +120 Each time you are hit by a monster: -100 Each time you collect a medal: +200 Each time you collect a golden frog: +1000 Stage 1 Boss: +1500 Stage 2 Boss: +1500 Stage 3 Boss: +1500 Stage 4 Boss: +2500 85 "

PAINT THE FENCE AMZ'S BRONX-SKI BEAT 'EM UP! The Saturn conversion has come on a long way since the Tokyo Game Show version featured last issue. All of the main characters are now in the game, all the backgrounds are working, and the motion blur traces have been added to the weapons. There's still a lot of work to be done though fighter shadows need to be coded, plus AM3 are likely to add lots of new features. Hopefully these will include some more hidden fighters as well as the usual survival, training and team battle modes. While the walls aren't as big as those in Fighting Vipers, they are still useful. A simple jump lets you get on top of the wall, and any button will make you jump off with an attacking move.

TOO BIG FOR EUROPE SHOCK Control in Goemon 64 is very similar to Mario 64. The characters Goemon and Ebisu move around at a speed dictated by the position of the 3D stick. Push lightly to walk, a little more to jog, and full tilt to run. Just like Mario these guys can swim, though in the version we played they couldn't dive under the water. Instead of punching and kicking Goemon uses a pipe to thwack his enemy, and Ebisu uses a mallet. Both characters can crawl to slip beneath obstacles. For long range attacks the guys dig into their pockets for cash retrieved from defeated enemies. NEW GAMES Due to Goemon 64 being present, ed on a massive 128 Meg cart, it's unlikely that Konami will consider releasing the game in Europe. It would cost too much (+). Add to that the problem of translating the Japanese text, and fans just don't have a hope. Kind of a low note to end the feature with. Try not to hate us for it.

Fighting Force drags the age old formula banging and crashing into the '90s. Paysalon PlayStation SATURN ROM e're not about to go shouting the house down for Fighting Force, after all this is a scrolling beat 'em up. And how many of these have we seen in the last decade! But this game is cool. In fact we're surprised countless other software houses haven't tried the same thing bringing one of the most popular game styles up to date, with more bone-crunching realism than ever before. Only Sega's Die Hard Arcade comes close. Spring-boarding off every idea which made the classic Streets Of Rage and Final Fight games so successful, Fighting Force incorporates the popular 3D angle to great effect. FIGHTING FORCE THE SCROLLING BEAT 'EM UP IS ALIVE AND KICKING! ISMASHA YOUR FACE Case you're one of the few people who doesn't know what a scrolling beat 'em up is, here's how Fighting Force works. In the main game, one or two players lead a street-fighting crimebuster in an assault on some big-city thugs. Your arena is the city streets. All fighting moves are pretty simple to perform: one button to attack, another to jump, with a third to trigger a special attack. Nowhere near as complex as Tekken or Virtua Fighter! The fun here is all gained from trashing as many crooks as possible, in a few imaginative ways. STICKSANDSTONES AND BITS OFF CARS NEW GAMES Our lesson in tradition continues with a resume of improvised weapons. At all times, unarmed combat is the best all-round way of serving justice. However there are alternatives. In the old-style scrolling beat 'em ups, weapons such as iron pipes, daggers, and smoke bombs were found mysteriously scattered in the street. To add an element of believability Fighting Force is a little less obvious. Resourceful players must look toward parked cars or drinks bars for help smash a car into pieces to grab a piece of metal. Kick a bunch of drinks over for a broken bottle. It's a cool idea. FOUR AGAINSTONE IS FUN Though we are assured it exists, we must confess to seeing nothing as yet of the promised four-player rumble mode. This has been explained to us as an every man/woman for him/herself scenario, in an enclosed arena with no CPU controlled characters to get in the way. Guess the last person standing will be classed the winner. Who knows. Look forward to finding out though! And, by the way, you'll need a multi-tap to take part. 90 "

This long-awaited tribute to a classic gaming era is on course for an Autumn release. Expect loads of hype, to include red hot, real-life incarnations of Alana and Mace, to happen soon.

PlayStation It's from Namco. It uses the new analogue controller. It's a vastly improved sequel. It could be the best flying game on the PlayStation! You wanna know why? he original Ace Combat has sold reasonably well on the PlayStation. Of course being from Namco, success was practically assured. Even now the game still sells well on the Platinum range. Although dated visually, there's still an excellent two player mode. Realising there was still room for improvement, Namco went back to the drawing board. Now we can reveal the fruits of their labour. Its name Ace Combat 2. Better graphics and a much tighter game. Though sadly the two player mode is absent. Cheer up, because there's still a lot to get excited about here. FLY ME TO THE DANGER ZONE We have received information that enemy TVNET ispraching Our front DIE NAMCO'S SEQUEL IS READY FOR TAKEOFF!  Ace Combat 2 is a mission based game. Quite large it is too, because there's 30 missions in total to complete. The mission structure is non-linear. Meaning at the end of certain missions, you will have a choice between two candidates of where to go next. At the end of mission 16 Power Play, your choice will lead to two separate sub campaigns operation Alphaville or operation Bellissima. Each mission also has lots of variety. The first missions will get you used to combat. Here you will be encountering bombers and slow fighters. Later tanks, anti-aircraft guns, warships, and helicopters all make an appearance. Targets are not always machines either. Take out oil fields and a variety of buildings. The designers have really gone to town as every type of enemy you could think of has been included.

Certain missions are considered too difficult for just the lone pilot. Unless you really fancy yourself as Top Gun. For these missions you will have the option to pay a wingman to go to the party with you. John Hervard or Kei Nagase, also known as Slash and Edge respectively, are the two potential candidates. Once you've chosen your wingman, you need to give them instructions for the mission. Get them to cover your tail, attack enemy aircraft, attack ground base targets and so on. Of course this makes the mission easier, but upon completion you've got to pay your partner some hard-earned dollars. 92 "

You start the game with the A-4 and F-4. Two basic craft but enough to get you through the first couple of levels.

Thrust is obtained using the shoulder buttons, while the circle and cross symbols control weapons.
