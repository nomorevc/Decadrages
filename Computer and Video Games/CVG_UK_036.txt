"1PET COMPETITION COMPETIT WAR OF THE WORLDS DAVID'S DAY OUT \"The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one they said\". So goes that famous line from Jeff Wayne's brilliant record of the War of the Worlds written by Herbert George Wells. And what has Feargal Sharkey got to do with it anyway, you might ask. In our recent War of the Worlds Competition, we asked you to answer four questions connected to the WOW, one of which was to say who you thought Nigel Taylor, the WOW programmer, resembled. Well we think he looks like Feargal Sharkey, formerly lead singer with the Undertones. The C&VG team couldn't believe the number of people who thought Nigel looked like Boy George! There were 45 magnificent prizes up for grabs, with Jeff Wayne's record of WOW, a copy of the game and a copy of HG Wells' book going to the first five correct entries out of the memory bin. Well done to: Daryl Ward, Leicester; Pedro Loureiro, Portugal; Alex Brown, Cheshire; Andrew Cox, Sussex and Jonathan Bramad, Sussex.

Alien 2: Shut-up and put the kettle on! Robot: If he calls me a kettle again, I'm going home to mother! And the second lucky winner was Kjell Nylund from Surrey with: Alien 1: Kicked off the C&VG Top 30 chart by Jet Set Willy! Alien 2: Forced into redundancy by the Manic Miner! Robot: (groaning) Oh no!

The three members of the software design team are amongst the top programmers that have been turned out of British universities over the last few years. One of the directors of Talent, Professor Andrew Colin, was the head of the computer science department of the University of Strathclyde for over ten years. The first of their three games is West, a challenging Adventure set in a ghost town in the Wild West. The player must flush out a gang of robbers and collect their loot. Kalah is a program based on an ancient Bedouin game played with pebbles and a board made from holes scooped out of the ground. The final game in Talent's first batch of software is Archipelago. The player in this game must try to retrieve a cache of fabulous jewels from a series of undersea mazes which link the islands together. At the same time, he must shoot, or avoid, the deadly guardians of the treasure. Archipelago and Kalah run on the Commodore 64 and cost .95 each.

Until now that is. The gamesters at the Workshop are bringing out two new titles for the Spectrum 48k. The first, Battlecars, is based on the board game of the same name and involves racing about in heavily armoured deathmobiles challenging other drivers to a duel to the death. It's a two player game and the screen displays three real-time map windows simultaneoulsy plus other instrumentation necessary for a Battlecar driver. There are two different scenarios, a speed-circuit or a town centre labyrinth. The second new game is called D-Day and is a graphic war game based on the 1944 Normandy landings. Two players battle it out over four different locations. Both games should be available around October and will sell for .95. "

The mission is seemingly hopeless. Fly along the river at zero altitude, twisting and turning crazily to stay within its tortuous banks, blasting at anything and everything in sight. Especially the bridges. Three of your jets are held in reserve while you are pitched against Battleships, Enemy Aircraft, Land Tanks, Balloons, Helicopter Gunships. All intent only on your destruction. And destroy you they will, if you don't get them first. You'll need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge. But take comfort, you can take fuel on board from one of the special depots. If you get hit-and nobody has yet reached the end of the river your next reserve starts at the last bridge you blasted on your way through! Each target you destroy adds to your points score.

The only way Thor can get across the river is to hop on the turtles' backs These turties sometimes get tired and submerge at the wrong moment much to Thor's dismay! To add to Thor's difficulties, his arch-enemy Fall Broad is waiting on the other side to ambush him. If Thor's timing is good, the Dooky Bird will help him over the lava pit. he jumps the pit just when Dooky Bird is overhead, the prehistoric bird will pick him up and carry him across! Thor must build up plenty of speed during his downhill run before the cliff. Timing is crucial, too. If Thor's balance is off or he is too slow he will crash into the ravine or the face of the clini. Once over the cliff, Thor faces his most difficult challenge: the volcanic eruption. In addition to the obstacles on the ground, he is showered with boulders from the sky. Once again Thor must cross the river on the turtles' backs. Then, at last he must face the dinosaurl If Thor can get past the dinosaur and into the cave, he has only a short way to go to rescue Cute Chick.

"Challenging, sophisticated, advanced, extra special. Be the world's greatest sleuth in the most advanced and challenging adventure game ever. For the first time ever, here is an adventure game in which you can talk with intelligent characters, ask them questions and argue with their conclusions all in everyday English sentences. Work against time to solve the mystery as you travel about Victorian England. Villains, suspects and witnesses all five out their lives in a realistic manner, and you can never be sure of who or what you will find anywhere. You must be alert because nobody is above suspicion. In 'Sherlock', the world of the famous private detective comes vividly to life. Time passes naturally: day turns to night, racing towards the inescapable deadline. You must ensure Sherlock has sufficient time for sleep, money to travel on public transport and other necessities. And you can rely on Dr. Watson to help you collate information, or gather clues. 'Sherlock' makes the maximum use possible of the 48K Spectrum and is the result of 15 months' work by a team led by programmer Philip Mitchell, the author of 'The Hobbit'. The text and graphics of \"Sherlock' makes it the most exciting and sophisticated adventure game yet devised. Study the clues, question the suspects, make the deductions and match your wits against the most dastardly criminals in history.

Bouncer Bert is a kangaroo and you have to guide nim through a set of hazards to reach his mates on the other side of the outback, The hazards come in rows of gum trees with gaps in between, which you have to jump through at the right moment to avoid being squashed. But it's not easy as it seems, as the gaps keep moving every few seconds. Timing, you'll find out, is critical. If you've ever played Jumping Jack from Imagine, then you'll have a head start in this game, but this version's more colourful and there are pretty graphics instead of plain lines. Use the H and K keys to move Bouncer Bert from side to side and the U key to move him up the screen. To restart the game, press A. There are four skill levels and you choose one at the start. Level one is the hardest and four is the easiest. Have fun, and remember to be kind to your Vic! "

"Home computers. The report you've been waiting for: simple, factual, honest, comprehensive and 100% biased. "


"ALL you need to know about computers can be summed up in one word: Commodore. (Well, we did tell you this would be biased). We make everything you'll ever need to get the most out of home computing: all the hardware and all the software. (And if you don't understand what that means, simply look under \"H\"). That's what these three pages are all about: explaining what computers are without the scientific jargon), how they work (without any technical mumbo-jumbo), and how you can get more enjoymentoutofthem (without much difficulty). CHIP: micro. A very complex electrical circuit that has been miniaturisedin silicon. Unlike other home computer companies, Commodore manufacture their own chips, so first class quality can be maintained. ISK drive. A program storage system, like cassettes, but much faster. You can find the program you're 1541 looking for in seconds instead of minutes. Disks, which can be used again and again for recording or re-recording programs, are placed in the disk drive which then transfers the information or instructions to the CPU. It has an extensive 64K memory with an exceptionally large 60K available for use. The plus/4 comes equipped with the Commodore BASIC 3.5 with over 75 programming commands. Other features include comprehensive graphics, 121 colours and sound facilities. BJ BASIC. Most home computers speak the same language. It's called BASIC. This is a friendly way of saying \"Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code! There are different kinds of BASIC and, like languages, some are a little easier to understand than others. Like, for instance, BASIC 3.5 in the Commodore plus/4 and Commodore 16 computers. BOOKS you can read: \"Teach Yourself Computer Programming With The Commodore 64\" and \"Programmers Reference Guide! EDUCATION software from Commodore. We are continually working with educationalists, improving our range of programs for the pre-schoolto \"O\"levelage groups and beyond. Many claim computers are an essential educational aid. We tend to agree! Our \"Get Ready to Read\" series, with a lovable character called B.J. The Bear, is recognised as an excellent example C ORTEK and the Microchips is a unique programming course, for children of all ages, that links learning exercises with a space adventure story GRAPHICS The pictures and diagrams on a monitor or TV screen, either high or low resolution All Commodore home computers have 66 graphic symbols to create low resolution pictures and diagrams, or high resolution modes that allow you to specify each pixel or dot) on the screen. (There can be upto 64,000 of these). GAMES: Commodore produce them all, from shoot'em up games, to games of adventure and complex strategy. ASSETTE. Just as you keep your _ favourite TV programmes on video cassette, and your favourite music on audio cassette, you can keep your favourite computer programs on cassette too. You can buy pre-recorded programs in a shop, or you can write them yourself. Cassettes are just one form of program storage and playback see also Cartridges and Disk Drive. The Commodore 1530 and 1531 cassette units have been specifically designed to get the very best out of our computers, and provide consistently reliable results. of how it is possible to develop reading and writing skills in pre-school children. ELEPHANT: wellknown symbol of the Commodore 64's enormous 64K memory. And don't you forget it! HELP! On the Commodore plus/4 computers there is a very special feature: a HELPkey. It does exactly what it says: it helps you to debug (which is a flash way of saying, «identify and correct errors\") when you're programming It highlights errors right down to individual instructions. HARDWARE The computer itself you can touch it. Whereas software's a program you can only see or hear(on the monitor when it's running in the computer CARTRIDGES. These are programs that plug directly into the back of the computer itself. CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. This is the computer's \"brain and basically it's what does all the hard work. HOUR is for Commodore plus/4, our very latest home computer with four, very popular built-in programs: wordprocessing, spread-sheet (financial planning), database (filing), and graphics. "


"M ory, over again. It stores data and instructions during the execution of a computer program. These are lost when you switch the machine offunless, of course you store them on cassette or disk nes ing urs NTEGRAL software is software that's actually built into the computer, as on the Commodore plus/4, the very latest in home computing. INTRODUCTION to BASIC. Just as you don't need to understand how a car works to be able to drive it, you don't have to understand how a computer works to be able to use one. But you will definitely get more enjoyment out of it if you do have a basic knowledge of programming. Which is why \"Introduction to BASIC\" has become the most popular software tutorial. It comprises 2 cassettes and an easy-to-follow, step-by-step booklet. INPUT/output: the part of the computer that allows data to be transferred between its own internal memory (the RAM memory) and an external device (like a cassette unit, disk drive or printer) ONITOR:thisisthe screen on which you can see what you've typed into the computer, and also what the computer is saying back to you. You can use an ordinary TV screen, but more preferable is a colour video monitor, like the Commodore 1701. This is a special device that produces much higher resolution than a TV, and so offers superb reproduction and clarity. On top of which it allows the rest of the family to stay tuned-in to their favourite TV programme while you're tuned-in to your favourite computer program. MODEMS allow computers to connect via a telephone line to other computersystems. Commodore 64 modem owners can communicate with other owners, join systems like Prestel/Micronet and an exciting new system called Compunet, where quality software is available cheaply or even free. UMBER ONE. In the _ whole wide world, Commodore is No. 1 in microcomputers, and the Commodore 64's the No. 1 best seller. is a rse, hat bry. ms on. nic on OYSTICK and paddles. _As well as improving speed and accuracy, these make games more real by putting the control of whatever it is on the screen *** directly into your hands. RIGIN of the computer. In the _19th Century an Englishman, Charles Babbage, invented the first true computer. But his \"Analytical Engine was so ahead of its time, it turned out to be impossible to build! The modern computer first appeared around the time of World War II. Britain's \"Colossus\" was vast, consumed vast amounts of electricity, required its own air-conditioned room, was unreliable and difficult to operate. It had its limitations. Then came the amazing transistor... integrated circuits...and microcomputer The first desk top microcomputer in the world was the Commodore PET (a friendly name for Personal Electronic Transactor), in 1977. In effect Commodore had taken hitherto huge mysterious machines accessable only to eggheads, reduced the size and price, and put them into the hands of ordinary mortals in ordinary offices. BONUS POINT 100 KE KILOBYTE is 1,024 bytes. . So \"K\" stands for a unit of 1,024 or 210 A 64K byte memory unit contains 64 x 210 or 65,536 bytes of memory. And if you don't understand all that, don't worry. All that's important 00 is knowing you can run more complex programs through MEMORY. There are two basic a computer with a large memory, types of memory: ROM and RAM. than one with a small memory. Read Only Memory (ROM) is the computer's permanent built-in ANGUAGE. This is a system of memory which tells the computer what coding that can be under to do. It doesn't disappear when the stood by a computer. It allows you computer's switched off. to \"speak\" to the computer, Random Access Memory and for the computer to 'speak\" (RAM), however, to you. Most home computers HELLO! IS THAT is for temporary speak BASIC, but there are also (THE COMMODORE COMPUTER storage. other languages available for ACROSS THE ROAD?

It can be and PILOT in education. erased and used over and ERIPHERALS. These are outside the main body of the computer, but are connected to it. They perform a definite function, which is usually input or output. PRINTER: One of the ways a computer can \"speak\" to us. It means you can actually keep, on paper, the fruits of all your labour. ach you or) "

"Here's a driving game with a difference for Spectrum owners. It's set in a fairground, and you have to steer the roller coaster through nine different hazards, each of which has only one path through it. This is like no other game of its kind that you have seen or played before. The steering of the car is all done in super fast machine code and is amazingly smooth. But don't worry about typing the machine code in separately as it's all included in the Basic listing here. The screens are arranged in difficulty order, so luckily there's a demo mode so that you can see what you're missing if you can't get past the first few screens. Nigel, who wrote it, says that he has over 50 different sheets at home so watch out for additions to the program in a future edition of C&VG. Use keys Q,A,O and P to steer. Any key on the bottom row will apply the brakes until you press one of the direction keys. Time is displayed during the game in tenths of a second, but on the hall of fame it's shown in seconds. The record time is 98.8 seconds So what are you waiting for? RUNS ON A SPECTRUM BY NIGEL CAMPBELL "

Alien attackers approaching your sector! Seek and destroy!» You control a fortified gun turret armed with phasers and photon torpedoes. You can observe and fire in different directions by using the joystick to rotate the turret. Fire the phasers by pushing the joystick forwards. But you'll need to hit the enemy several times before you destroy them. The photon torpedoes are more destructive. Hit an alien and he's wiped out. Fire these by pressing your fire button. Firing depletes your energy level, though, and, if it reaches zero, the game is all over. If the aliens manage to get within seven units away from the tower, the same can be said! As the enemy attacks, friendly forces also attempt to reach the turret carrying supplies. These can be recognised by their waving antennae. Do not blast them! The higher you score, the faster the aliens come at you. So for high scores you'll need to be quick. Best of luck, sharpshooters! "

"ECOME LONE WOLF. ... sole survivor of a devastating attack on the monastery of Kai. A great cloud of black winged beasts has swept down and engulfed the monastery. All the Kai Lords, whose secret skills you were learning, have been killed. Raising your face to the sky, you swear revenge on the Darklords of the West. But first, you must warn the King of the invasion, retrieve Sommerswerd and then use it to beat off the attackers. There are now two exciting LONE WOLF adventure games. Each one requires you to assume the mantle of Lone Wolf, make all his decisions for him, and actually fight his combats move by move. You really are Lone Wolf. You are going on a journey, a quest. You create your own adventures, choose your own tactics and make your own decisions. You swear adventure you may find that you are becoming more and more proficient. If you, too, have mastered these skills they may save your life! THE LESSONS OF COMBAT AND ENDURANCE When you were training with the Kai Lords, you acquired many secret skills and disciplines. Now, you may need to use them. You may need to improve some, and disregard others, \"Combat Skills\" may be needed to defeat the enemies you encounter on your way to reaching the beleaguered King, and whilst saving your country. You will need \"Endurance\" to survive. Each decision you make can alter the course of your adventure. So choose wisely, for you will often be totally surprised by the effect your choice may have on your survival. You can learn how to hideundetected amongst rocks and trees of the countryside. In a city, you can look and sound like a native which may help you to find shelter Learn how to communicate with animals and move objects by sheer concentration alone. You can develop a \"Sixth Sense\" that warns you of imminent danger. It may also reveal the true nature of a stranger. \"Tracking\" may help you choose the right path and decipher prints or tracks of creatures in the wild. THE SURVIVAL DISCIPLINES Over the centuries, the Kai Lords had mastered the skills of the warrior. As you proceed through your "


"The discipline of \"Healing\" can restore your \"Endurance\" after being wounded in combat THE «COMBAT\" SKILLS When you entered the Kai monastery you were taught to fight with daggers, spears, warhammers, axes and swords. The evil Darklords, though, have the ability to attack using \"Mindforce\". Lone Wolf can learn the discipline of \"Mindshield\" and also \"Mindblast\", the old Kai Lord's ability to fight using the forces of the mind alone. You, Lone Wolf, control the combat, you decide whether to fight or not, and you alone can manipulate the moves. THE LONE WOLF ADVENTURES The creators of LONE WOLFare Joe Dever and Gary Chalk. In 1982, Joe won the Advanced \"Dungeons and Dragons\" Championship in America. Gary has had 17 years experience of war games, and is the originator of the highly successful \"Cry Havoc and \"Starship Captain\". Together they have created two unique adventures combining the skills of mental and more physical dexterity. And there are more to come. The presentation is visually exciting, and involves you totally in every action and reaction. Discover the LONE WOLF adventures \"Flight From the Dark\" and \"Fire on the Water\". Now, available individually in a special gift box, including a cassette and illustrated book for .95. (Software only .95 each.)

Just in case you've never played the game, here's what you have to do. Using the joystick, your job is to guide your frog across a crowded road.

"BUG HUNTER'S GUIDE TO This is the second of the C&VG Bug Hunter wallcharts. You'll find everything that a beginner needs to know about the Spectrum on this page, including all the best games. So cut it out and stick it on the wall next to your machine, and you'll never be lost for the facts. 2 DOO EUANGE OOOOOOO BED SPECTRUM GAMES FROM C&VG We try to publish at least one Spectrum listing in every issue of C&VG. They're all games, but not all alien-blasting keyboardbashers. For the ultimate in spy strategy games, there's Treachery by Mike (Seventh Empire) Singleton. This fills the memory of a 48k machine and also took up quite a few pages in March '84. If you like board games, then try Micropoly from May and if you find it hard to tear yourself away from the soap operas on TV to read your copy of C&VG, then you can't have missed August's special soapy edition, complete with a game based on a certain well known soap opera. THE SPECTRUM HARDWARE ADD-ONS There are more peripherals around for the Spectrum than for any other micro at the moment. Maybe it's because the Spectrum's hardware lacks so much that other companies decided to supply the missing pieces. DK Tronics make a proper keyboard for the machine, as do Fuller. These are quite expensive but certainly make the computer a lot easier to use. If you're fed up with using cassettes, then Microdrives are now freely available. They cost $49.95 and the same again for the Interface 1 which controls them. They will load most games in around 20 seconds, but the cartridges are still overpriced at .95 each. The most popular joystick interfaces are made by AGF and Kempston, although the official Sinclair Interface 2 is catching up fast. The Sinclair ZX printer is no longer being made, so you may be able to snap up one cheaply as dealers try to clear their shelves. Otherwise, go for an Alphacom 32 which, at , is great value and has better print quality. You can also buy a Centronics interface to connect the Spectrum t a rr printer. You can link a Spectrum up to Micronet with a VTX 5000 modem. More details from Micronet on 01-278 3143. If you can't afford Micronet's charges, then there's always the TTX 2000 Teletext adaptor from OEL. This will turn your Spectrum into a Ceefax and Oracle receiver. The interface costs  but, once paid for, all of Ceefax's and Oracle's pages are free. And there're no telephone calls, either. BEST IN THE SHOPS There's never been any shortage of games for the Spectrum. The classic arcade games are et Set Willy and Manic Miner, from Software Projects. Then there's Jet Pac, Lunar Jet Man, Atic Atac and Sabre Wulf from Ultimate, whose graphic screens must be seen to be believed. Tet Pac runs in 16k, but the rest need a 48k machine. Psion's Horace series is also very popular, as is their Scrabble game. Top of the Adventure league for many a month was The Hobbit which is still good value. And if you can solve that, try Valhalla from Legend. For the top-selling games, keep an eye on the C&VG/Daily Mirror chart which is published in each issue of the magazine. SINCLAIR BASIC Sinclair wrote their own version of Basic to be used on the Spectrum. It is similar to that used on the ZX81 but has more commands, including those to handle the extra graphics and sound facilities. It's unlike any other version of the language and can be difficult to learn if you are used to programming, say, a BBC or a Commodore machine. If you're trying to learn machine code on a Spectrum, then Melbourne House publishes The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly. This is the best place to start, for beginners and experienced programmers alike. A good assembler program is Hisoft's Devpac. LOADING AND SAVING The Spectrum is very reliable when it run on loading, type SAVE \"name\" comes to saving or loading LINE 10 which will start the program programs. To save a Basic program, running from line 10 as soon as it is type SAVE \"name\". When it has loaded. saved, use the VERIFY command to You can change the 10 to any check that it was saved correctly. If number, to start at the line you wish. you don't, and you turn off the If you want to load an auto-running machine, then there is no way to program but don't want it to run, use recover your program if you find that MERGE instead of LOAD. You won't it did not save properly. be able to do this with a program on If you want your program to automicrodrive, though. MORE DETAILS You can get further information on all of Sinclair's hardware and software from their office at Stanhope Road, Camberley, Surrey GU15 3PS. Or telephone them on Camberley (0276) 686100. Sinclair publishes a Spectrum software catalogue with details of all their programs for the machine. If you've ever bought anything from them by mail order, then you'll already be on their mailing list for leaflets and catalogues. "

"So what do you do after starring in the best comedy series of the past 10 years? Write a book, of course! Then along comes some computer whizz who wants to make a game based on your words! And then the best computer games magazine around organises a competition so its readers can win copies of the game. Fame and fortune all over again! C&VG's Ace Adventurer Keith Campbell has been finding out about how Monty Python star Terry Jones and his creation, Erik the Viking, became the latest stars in the ever growing universe of Adventureland. I ventured warily into the dark cave above the rocky face of the fjord and there before me was the enticing Enchantress. \"Come in,\" she beckoned, \"and close the door...\"I entered, my heartbeat quickening. \"Take the chalice,\" she whispered. I took it, entranced by her charms. \"Now drink,\" she breathed. The Saga of Erik the Viking from Mosaci Publishing is a remarkable Adventure game. It carries all the hallmarks of a Level 9 Adventure problem, text display and size of map with graphics of a standard I have not yet seen before in an Adventue. The former is not surprising, since Level 9 were commissioned to write the game by Mosaic; what is remarkable is the sight of their first venture into graphics AND the fact that they have done all this on a BBC micro. The Saga of Erik the Viking is a modern book of old-fashioned fairy stories written by Terry Jones (yes, the Python who always wears a tie whilst playing the piano!) and lavishly illustrated by Michael Foreman. It relates the exploits of Erik and his band who sailed the Golden Dragon in search of the land where the sun goes at night. Danger, excitement, magic and mystery are the ingredients of the book, and no less, of the Adventure game. The action takes place some years after Enk's first saga, but all his old mates are there, Ragnar Forkbeard, Thornhild et al, and many of the places Erik visits with this motley crew contain scenarios familiar to the reader of the book. You, of course, play the part of Erik and your first problem is to get the necessary supplies and equipment to sail the Golden Dragon in search of your kidnapped family. If you can summon your crew, that is! The seas are laid out logically, but navigation can be aided by the use of one or two magical devices, should the Dragon not be up to the course you set. So I set sail and started to explore the many fjords and beaches where the Dragon could land. Sail to Jorvik and you might get a pet cat-if you have the price. Sail elsewhere and you will be set a monumental task of the legendary type to return with, among other things, the root of a mountain and the beard of a woman. Erik's adventures at each port of call interconnect, for obstacles at some places must be overcome in order to achieve the full potential at others necessary to complete the game. Thus, the game is similar to the book, in which each chapter is complete in itself, but links with successive ones to form the complete saga. The text is plentiful, though obviously less varied than can be achieved with a non-graphical Adventure. I say varied, for it is fairly verbose, but just a little repetitive. The graphics are something else! The book contains many fantastic full-colour illustrations and the Adventure's computerised equivalent does them more than justice. Each picture is authentic inasmuch as it is based on extensive research, as indeed, is the setting for the whole game. You can, for example, visit a Viking loo, a sauna complete with stone stove, or take a trip to find a stave church or an Orkney croft. In this respect, it must be mentioned that there are many empty locations, but they are interesting to pass through in their own right, as the graphics make for a scenic journey. They are fast to display, with no garish colours (à la TKV) and are a credit to the design and programming capability of Level 9. Another authentic touch is the score feature. To complete the game, «There was a roar and Erik and his men turned to see a terrible creature glaring down at them.\" 124 "

This is where a program is handed, previously unseen, to people unconnected with its development to see if they come across any nasties. I found one or two minor irritations, which I duly reported back to Level 9, and so I am proud to be able to say I actually helped in a very small way to improve the final version. On the BBC, there won't be quite so many pictures as on other micros nevertheless, there are an incredible number. I saw the lot since they were, at that stage, on a separate program from the text game and still to be integrated.

About 18 months ago, many readers noticed advertisements for Vic versions of the Mysterious Adventures and now write asking where and how they can be obtained. The ads were from a firm called Leisuresoft who persuaded Brian, somewhat against his will, to make the conversions. The first three were squeezed into an 8k RAM pack, as few Vic owners at that time possessed more memory. Brian was never very happy with the results. The Leisuresoft deal proved unsatisfactory and, worse, he had to make drastic cuts in the text to fit the games in. He felt he was cheating the people who were buying the games and decided not to convert any more. The situation has now changed says Brian, with many more Vic owners having a 16k RAM pack. So he has signed up with Channel 8 to convert the whole series for the Vic and all titles should now be available. Brian is now concentrating on a brand new series.

"THE 1984 ARCADE CHAMP UIPS The new Computer & Video Games 1984 Arcade Champion took his crown in the closing stages of a nailbiting contestat Xenon, a posh nightclub in the heat of the West End of London Seventeen arcade hotshots battled it out on a sweltering August day over a series of heats using Dragon's Lair, Track & Field, Gyruss and Star Wars. Jools Holland, star presenter of The Tube, Channel 4's pop show, then invited the four finalists with the highest scores on each machine to tackle each other in a grand final on Flicky a brand new game unveiled for the first time at the C&VG championships. Flicky features a mother duck and her chicks involved in a series of death defying adventures Mark Payne, elected by Jools to go Mark Payne is the 1984 Computer & Video Games Champion! He won the title in an actionpacked event at a posh London nightclub. Clare Edgeley, C&VG's Arcade ace, reports. first, scored a magnificent 28,860 in his five minute session, setting a tough task for those to follow Stephen Munroe and Michael Chilton found it a little more difficult to control Flicky, the motor duck, and her chicks and both came away with some 14,000 points. Finally, David Bushby played and almost reached 28,000 but the whistle blew. Phew! A close finish which left a beaming Mark Payne from Redcar, Cleveland the C&VG Champ! Jools Holland presented Mark with a table top version of Hunchback provided by Taitel, who COsponsored the championships. Taitel also presented Mark with a new games cartridge for the machine Amazing Heart Attack. Mark will be able to swap cartridges in his prize machine for a different challenge. Two games in one. Not bad. He'll also be able to go back to Taitel for more cartridges for the machine whenever he gets too good at the games we provided! Mark, who qualified for the final on Track & Field with 64,660, suitably dressed in a pair of running shorts and trainers said, \"I put this gear on just in case I got too hot playing Track & Field. \"I really enjoyed myself and I'm glad I've won. I'll be looking around for some new games to practise on to enter into next year's championships. I'll probably put Hunchback in my bedroom!\" All the finalists went home with special C&VG certificates, a hand held pinball game and watch from CGL and the soundtrack of Electric Dreams a brand new film release from Virgin Films. 146 "

Fill it in and rush it off to C&VG. We'll be announcing the date and venue for the awards ceremony shortly. Meanwhile, we'll give you a better idea of what we want you to think about when you make your nominations. Game of the Year — this is pretty easy to work out. Any game, whether it's an arcade-style shoot-out or a graphic Adventure, qualifies for this award. Software House of the Year-does your favourite software house produce high quality games? Does it offer good after-sales service? Do you always look out for a new game? If so-then enter it here! Best Original Game-again this is pretty easy to explain. What's the most exciting new game you've seen this year which has a totally original concept and/or design? Best Adventure Game-text or graphic Adventures can win their own Golden Joystick Award for the first time this year. How about The Hobbit? Or Lords of Midnight? Best Strategy Game-another new category for 1984. This includes war games, board game conversions, simulations other than sports, and all the original strategy games that are zooming up the charts like Mugsy, Psytron, and Worse Things Happen at Sea.

Software Projects are edging ahead of last year's winner, Ultimate, in the Software House of the Year category. There is still plenty of time to vote, though, as in all the categories. Other companies doing well here are Ocean, Llamasoft and Microdeal. The Adventure Game category looks like being one of the most fiercely contested this year with Questprobe, Twin Kingdom Valley and Lords of Midnight making the running so far.

"DON'T JUST SIT THERE PLAY SOMETHING! FORBIDDEN FOREST Forbidden Forest is more of a quest than just a game! The action takes place in a four dimensional scrolling forest landscape which many have entered, but none has returned. Yes, I did say FOUR dimensional day fades into night as the action unfolds! The quest is to seek out and destroy the Demogorgon, mystic ruler of the Forbidden Forest. Before you can even set eyes on him you will have to contend with his army of fearsome creatures, including mutant spiders, showers of giant frogs, snakes, dragons, skeleton soldiers and more! You have only your trusty bow and arrows to depend on! SS018 AZTEC CHALLENGE A challenge on an epic scale! Aztec Challenge takes you on a journey to Mexico and the ancient pyramid of Tenochtitlan. The ancient Aztec gods and their devotees have ensured that no ordinary human can learn the secrets of the temple and live to tell the tale. The pyramid is protected by all manner of treacherous traps and hidden perils an epic test of your courage and cunning. Aztec Challenge features no less than seven totally different screens here are just three of them each of which presents a brand new challenge. We hope your joystick can stand up to it! SSO19 LEVEL O2 00020140 PLAYS4 SLINKY Slinky, the spring, was having fun hopping about when suddenly he came upon a pile of coloured blocks, so he thought he'd play around on them for a while. Much to his amazement he found that they changed colour when he landed on them. Wow! But unknown to him, the blocks belonged to the Wicked Wizard, who sent his friends along to tease our poor hero. Slinky is a real fun package with ninety-nine levels, amazing reward displays, and action replays. Where else could you meet such charming characters as Dusty the dust cloud, Marge the magnet, Ralph the random raindrop, and Lorenzo the chameleon hopper?
