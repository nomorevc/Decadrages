HIGHES VDATION t has been a month of rediscovery for Paul: It began when he bought a new Super Famicom to replace his time-worn original. He's had a lot of enjoyment out of that, so he tells us. Then he got his PlayStation 'chipped' and borrowed a load of Japanese stuff for playing at home the Tobal pack with the Square demo is what brought that little expenditure on. Finally he rediscovered Rochdale, his home town. All flowers, Get Well cards, and confectionery will be forwarded to him through this office. EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES:  NIGHTS  Tetris Attack  Tobal No.1  Super Mario 64  Fighting Vipers  Wonder Project 4 ...VERY GOOD Outstanding quality. Only minor limitations prevent this game from being an all-round 'must have'. Among the best money can buy for your machine. TOM GUISE These games may not be innovative, or fall into every body's notion of ideal. They are either well produced examples of common concepts, or slightly flawed workings of originality. But they are definitely worth looking at. 3....GOOD # 12...PRETTY BAD 40 1.1.VERY POOR There's something fundamentally wrong with the mechanics, or the presentation lets the game down (ie it's in a foreign language). Could still keep some people happy, but we can't wholeheartedly recommend it. omeone handed Tom a pencil this month, whereupon he learned to draw and write his name. This we liked. Then he took to drawing pictures of the CVG team, and writing our names beneath the grotesque images. So, we confiscated the pencil and sat Tom in front of DEP EDITOR a PC, so that he might learn someCURRENT FAV GAMES: thing useful. He learned to call him NIGHTS (best again) self the Tomminator, change colours  Quake in the blink of an eye, and insult  Simpsons CS  Mario 64 people around the globe. And for no  Fighting Vipers good reason. That's the evil of  Virtua Cop Quake, readers. Evil! And we lost that pencil too! An all-round loser: We're depressed by it. The company responsible are embarrassed by it. And you could really get by a lot better without it.

The theory of play is supported by the fact that the video game maintains a wide popularity even after the Space Invader game has been phased out. tronger than a hundred angry grizzlies.

"computer video games NEWSO NINTENDO 64: ROCKING OR ROCKY?] Following the June launch explosion of the N64, the months that followed have not run so smoothly for Nintendo. During the second week of August in particular, events went disturbingly out of control, following a report in a leading NINTENDO 64 Japanese newspaper that N64 sales had rapidly dropped off. This news caused such panic on the Japanese stock market, that stock prices fell sharply and trading of Nintendo's shares was suspended. This gave them the chance to counter claims that they weren't on schedule for five million sales by the end of March. They also stated they've shipped out one million N64s already. Meanwhile, news was also leaked about Nintendo's intention to drop the N64's US launch price from $249 to $199. Although not officially confirmed, it's claimed sources inside Nintendo of America have said this is to be the case. A good sign in the console price war, but a surprising move by a company previously so confident of mass sell-out. Perhaps more shocking than any of these external events though, was the news that Gumpei Yokoi creator of the Gameboy, the Metroid games and the less-successful Virtual Boy has left Nintendo. The circumstances of his departure have yet to be revealed, so claims that it relates to the failure of the Virtual Boy, internal arguments or even just retirement, are so far nothing more than rumours. SATURN SET FOR ANOTHER PRICE DROP! Following word that the N64 is to be released in the US at a lower price, it seems the Saturn could be in line for another price drop, in the US at least. New vice-president of SOA, Bernie Stolar, has said Sega will be first to drop their prices in future. And, although nothing has been confirmed, rumour has it that Saturn may drop price to $150. Stolar has also said that \"Sega will have more third party exclusive titles than any other system in the coming year.\" Something not to be taken lightly from a man who previously worked for Sony actively recruiting third party support. RESIDENT EVIL id CO-FOUNDER QUITS! THE VIDEO GAME FOR PLAYSTATION SHOCKING POSTER CAMPAIGNS With Quake finally on the shelves and no doubt becoming the fastestselling CD game ever, it comes as a shock to hear that John Romero, one of the driving forces behind both Doom and Quake, has left id Software with plans to start his own games company. No name has been decided on Dream Designs is the current favourite for the new development house which Romero says will break from the legendary first-person games formula laid down by id. He still intends to work closely with id, even licensing their 3D technology from them, however this is, he claims, his chance to explore other game types. .. You can tell the run-up to Christmas has begun. Big billboard ad campaigns are springing up all over the place! Ones definitely to watch out for are the Resident Evil and Quake ads. Both are equally gory games, and yet their ads are contrastingly different. Here's a taste of both of them. Which do : you find more chilling? CALLIN' ALL YE RETRO GAMERS! IS EVERYWHERE NEWS Avid fans of the our own Computer Cabin will know about this already, but HMV Level One in London is set to hold its own Retro Gaming Exhibition, bringing the premier games machines of yesteryear back for a celebration : sort of like a pensioners' reunion. Groovy old school machines such as the Atari VCS, Spectrum, Commodore 64, Vectrex, Mattelaquarius, Colecovision, Philips Video Pack and Intellevision are set to make an appearance, giving new and veteran gamers a chance to play the classic games first-hand. If you've been dying to get your hands on an old machine there's a Retro Gaming Auction, where all manner of gaming artifacts will be going under the hammer. Plus, there's a Retro Open Evening with guest game coders on hand to answer questions. Best of all though, to celebrate CVG's 15th Birthday we'll be there too, with the MicroGoblin ready to talk 'old school gaming' in person. The show runs from Monday October 21st to Saturday November 2nd and it's at 150 Oxford St. Be there or be square, daddio. Tie most important pour "


"computer Video games 1996 NkoHS 7 LAUNCHED IN Tapan:-.JULY 96 NiGHTS IS COMING! You'd better believe it. Sega aren't taking their greatest game of the year lightly. And with the game released on Sept 5th, it's the title they're using to roll out their pre-Christmas TV ad campaign. Enlisting the talents of HHCL Brasserie, the people behind the brilliant Tango and Pot Noodle ads, they've turned out an series of ads that break from the usual wacky-nonsense-and-speeded-up-game-footage to try and give viewers a real taste of the challenge their games offer. The 20-second NIGHTS ad throws down the gauntlet to UK gamers, by announcing the Japanese release for the game (July) and then the UK release. Close-up footage of the game is then reeled off, showing how intricate the gameplay is, while the Japanese champion explains his technique. His highscore is then revealed, followed by the current UK best a piffling zero of course! We think it's a great ad campaign and so we should, since Tom and Paul were involved in discussions with HHCL as to what they reckoned would be good. The NIGHTS ads are being shown on TV until the end of September, with ads for Worldwide Soccer, Virtua Cop 2 and Daytona Deluxe to follow. If you want to catch them, we definitely know they're on during the ad breaks of Movies, Games And Videos on Saturday mornings. We recommend Saturn owners tape them, because hidden at the end of each ad is a cool tip for each game. 1*12 Neuss PIA REUSCQR-UK: 0000000 LAUNCHED IN UK: Sept 961 008 COMPUTER CARTOON COCKROACHES! THIS BITCH WANTS YOUR BODY If you're after superior animated TV thrills this autumn. watch out for a series called Insektors on Channel 4 this October Featuring brilliant full-on computer-animation, it follows the eternal battle on the Black Planet between the goody alien bugs the Verigreens and their hero Flynn against the evil Queen Catheter and her Kruds. Complete nonsense of course, from the French too, but thanks to some bizarre dubbing (featuring Scouse insects, Home County butterflies and Wolverhampton beetles) it's all very funny. Supposedly. The series is also available on video right now. GROWING MINIONS OF EVIL! On the subject of Resident Evil, sales of the game have just passed a million in the US. Capcom's US president, Greg Ballard, claims that on the day it was released PlayStation sales rose and stayed there. He also expects sales of the game to double over the next few months.

A colour palette of 1 600 000 000 separate shades (on-screen display unspecified) 3. CP-System III can manipulate at least four times the amount of data as CP-System II. 4. Only requires around half the electrical power of previous Capcom units. 5. An unprecedented number of custom special effects built into the hardware. RESULTS: CP-SYSTEM III LAUNCH THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL DRIVE STREET FIGHTER 3! \"CAPCOM LTD, NEW HARDWARE, CP-SYSTEM III, UNVEILING SHOW.\" n Thursday 8 August, at the Sumitomo Building, Tokyo (Capcom HQ!) CP-System III was unveiled to the press. This dazzling technology, as showcased by the fighting game WarZard, will drive the long-awaited Street Fighter 3. Some of the features you learn about here may well be used to transform Ryu et al into a game Capcom describe as \"dramatically different\" to previous SF titles. Here are the details D A CD-ROM is used to store the gathered from this historic event. bulk of information in Capcom's new CP-System Ill games. ......................................................... 1. Many times more frames of animation, allowing characters to move with greater fluidity. For example Nool's tentacles all writhe slickly about. 2. Larger, more complicated bosses are now possible. For example Secmento the Sphinx like monster has four independently moving heads plus a snake for a tail. 3. More moving objects on screen without any sign of slow down. Look forward to seeing palm trees sway in the breeze, waterfalls tumbling, and roaring flames. 4. Super smooth ZOOM and PAN effects, with almost indistinguishable pixelisation and no shuddering. For example in Sangypt, you observe the scene from a walkway heading toward a huge building. The path is lined by pillars, each surmounted by an animal head. Palm trees sway, while the distant Pyramid is decorated by hieroglyphicS. ALL OF THIS IS zoomed into and panned across with apparent ease. This perfection is unaffected by any scale of complex action Special attacks, and so on. 5. 1024 levels of parallel scrolling. A good demonstration is the moun tain stage in which scenery moves in front of the characters skull on a rock for example as well as having realistic 3D perspective. 6. Entire screen warping effects for special attacks. All characters have special attacks which transform the background into a swirling kalei doscope of colours. All the while other objects move, as the fight rages on. 7. Greater animation of background objects, plus the interaction with scenery is easier to create. Magic chests which appear open to reveal spe cial orbs to collect. One special attack in the Greece like stage sends back ground pillars flying in all directions, as they are smashed to pieces. o 1631 USER COMU [138TRUE KETE > INSERT COINS 1166 t *:!1 MAOYCY KURO SYALMER CRAPPER CAPCOM'S CP-SYSTEM III UNVEILED 592 .

A world map is divided into numerous regions, all of which are highlighted in red indicating they are being terrorised by these monsters.

We suspect that once all the eight regional monsters are defeated, the final Boss monster will be revealed! 1180 INSERT COIN Monster: Hauzer Location: Greedia A huge T-Rex with tiny wings, birds feet and ram horns.

Write this down, and you can come back at a later date to continue your game. The password is requested from the Ready Warrior screen. The numbers in the password range from 1 to 6, meaning that codes are inputted by pressing corre sponding punch or kick buttons (1=jab, 6=Roundhouse, and so on).  ULTIMATE GUARD In addition to the standard guard, which works identically to Street Fighter Zero (Alpha), the new Ultimate Guard is indestructible. Press, punch and kick simultaneously while holding back on the stick to create an impenetrable guard.  HIGH JUMP Quickly tapping up then down enables fighters to perform a giant leap much higher than usual.  MYSTIC MAGIC By using one Mystic Orb collected during the course of a fight and entering a special command, fighters may perform a Mystic Attack. These very for each character.  MYSTIC BREAK Again, costs one Mystic Orb to perform. In this case fighters attempt a magical counter attack against an opponent's Mystic Magic.  ITEM COLLECTION Throughout battles various items are made available, to be collected from chests which appear on screen. Inside there is found a Mystic Orb (see above), healing potions, or food.

MY BEST FRIEND'S A BANK MANAGER CLASSIC GAMES 9999 LION USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES * Dear CVG, Dear CVG, I am writing to discuss the fact that, overall, IT IS THE SOFTWARE THAT COUNTS, and not the There seems to be a lot of suicidal PlayStation and system. I mean, the Super NES has had the excellent games including some major classics of Saturn owners out there, worrying about the N64. Last video game history Super Mario World, Mario Kart, etc. Even though it is half as powerful month the letters consisted of 'Why did the Saturn and technically) as PlayStation and Saturn, I don't think they will last as long as the Super NES PlayStation cost more than the N64 when they were has/is. Don't get me wrong, the games you get on these consoles are good Tekken, Sega released?', and pleas for a 64-bit upgrade. I get the Rally, etc but in my mind none of them actually qualify as absolute classics. impression that people think the N64 is to the Saturn and PlayStation what the Mega Drive is to them. The When glancing across the Nintendo 64 games line-up, it looks like Nintendo are going to do with N64 is undoubtedly the most powerful console out N64 what they have with the Super NES. Remakes of classics such as Mario Kart, and Pilot there, but in terms of performance I don't think it is Wings, mixed with 64-bit visuals almost guarantee satisfaction. Don't get suspicious I am not THAT much more powerful than the 32-bit systems. biased toward Nintendo. In fact I have only ever owned one Nintendo system, a Game Boy (the rest are Sega and PC). It's just that the massive experience of Nintendo will keep putting them In some ways the 32-bit consoles have the edge: Both ahead of all competitors. Role on more gaming classics! are CD based, which is why both cost around  iniGarfield and Friends (sic), Northants tially, and so will be able to handle games like Command and Conquer. So at  each they are TEAM: Come on now, VF2 is hardly going to go down in history as a 'flash in the pan'. And the absolute bargains.

However it is true that Nintendo's best games CHALLENGER CHAMPION 4 LINS On my P75, shareware Quake strains in places, and have a magic all of their own. It's bought that for just under .

There was a time when the Nintendo brand guaranteed the next With the release of the N64 a new gaming era has Squaresoft or Enix RPG, and the ultiarisen. Rather than get worried, PlayStation and Saturn mate action game from Capcom or owners should rejoice, because N64 has raised the Konami EXCLUSIVELY. Now these expectations of gamers and, as a result, developers major players are contributing to are becoming more ambitious. NIGHTS is a response Sega and Sony's success. Like you to Mario 64, and having seen it running briefly it looks said, it's the software that counts. comparable to Mario 64 in looks. Hopefully it will be in Right now, Nintendo have only a few gameplay. And if Sega can pull off the conversion of examples to bargain with.

VF2 some would argue it's the greatest game ever made. Surely at least it's an absolute classic? Having said that, I will be buying an official N64. A brief play of Mario in an import shop has convinced me in terms of playability, Mario 64 is at the moment really in another class. For 3D platformers that is. Dear CVG, I've been reading your magazine for absolutely years Life is very strange. There I was walking into my local games store to buy Resident Evil for my now. I remember the Thundercats demo you gave and PlayStation, and then five minutes later I walk out with my money spent and a large package those naff BASIC listings you used to print. And whilst under one arm. This being too large to be a copy of Resident Evil, unless it comes with an 8000 the writers have changed I'm glad to see the quality page instruction manual. I eventually arrive home and remove a large box from the carrier bag, hasn't. two yellow eyes stare up at me and the word Jaguar is written clearly across the box on all sides. What have done, I hear some of you shout. Others I hear laughing and sniggering, and M Khan, Birmingham telling friends that somebody has bought an Atari Jaguar.

"2D INTO INFINITY computer video games BAG Dear CVG, As a veteran games player, and fan of Street Fighter since number one, I am so glad that Capcom have opted to make SF3 a 2D game. As the pinnacle of 2D beat 'em ups (and fighting games in general, in my opinion), a change to 3D for the SF series would be a grave mistake. So much would be lost from the game's overall appeal, and would change the gameplay entirely. Which brings me to the point that 2D and 3D games should be able to exist together. Just because the technology for quality 3D games comes along, it shouldn't bring the demise of 2D games with it. The main problem is that this may happen, in the UK at least. For example, in my local arcades Alpha 2 is getting much less recognition than Soul Edge, simply because of the game's aesthetics. The software releases for both the Saturn and PlayStation also reflect this, with games being purchased just because they have FMV or Real Time 3D graphics. Apart from games players such as myself who value a game primarily on how it plays, many players in the UK are purchasing titles simply because they display 32-bit technology. If the software houses respond to this by cutting their 2D production in favour of 3D, it will leave the game market quite empty, as 2D can offer much that 3D cannot (and vice versa). SOC STAR LETTER If 2D goes there will be no choice, and it is, after all, choice that makes the games industry continue. Choice brings innovation and better games which benefits us the games players. Jon Wright, Sheffield WAKE UP CALL Dear CVG. This letter is an attempt to wake up all those people who believe that Nintendo 64 is going to be the new Super Powered, Super Cheap console we've been waiting for. It won't be. K TEAM: Hey, just because your favourite arcade game isn't being played by a bunch of Soul Edge fans doesn't make it bad! But we empathise with your despair, Jon. Some players see a game like Guardian Heroes and immediately write it off as old fashioned 'if it ain't 3D, it's not an achievement' kind of attitude. It's not until you get hold of Three Dirty Dwarves that you can point out why Treasure's game is so superior! By the way, choice isn't the driving force behind innovation you can have a vast selection of mediocre games, and nobody is sure which to avoid buying first! Innovation comes from developers who have an original idea, and have enough financial backing to bring it to fruition. Super Mario 64, and NIGHTS spent almost three years in research. Apparently Quake was conceptualised before id started on Doom!!! NUMB. No matter which way you look at it, cartridges can only hold a fraction of the information a CD can. Games programmers are already saying that they are not going to convert some of their 32-bit games to N64 because they just can't fit them onto a cartridge. Dear CVG, Why is it that the Jaguar is 64-bit but everybody says that it's rubbish, whereas the N64 is 64-bit (no, really it is!) and everyone wants it? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?! Speaking of N64s: 1 went to my local branch of Electronics Boutique to enquire about it, and they said that it wouldn't be out until next Easter! Is this true? The Bulky Drive (64DD) is going to make the stand-alone N64 totally redundant. It is plain to see that a few months after the drive is released, everyone will stop making software for N64 and switch to making games for the Bulky Drive. What games producer would want to be limited to a pathetic little cartridge when he could have a massive CD to play around with? Think about it. Arguably the greatest video game ever. John Dinnewell, Royston 48 So, there are going to be some mightily pissed off N64 owners out there who can't fork out another  for the Bulky Drive. The total cost of an N64 plus Bulky Drive will be around . For that kind of money you could buy a Saturn, AND a PlayStation, with  left over. For every great N64 game, there will always be a 32bit equal anyway: For Mario there's NIGHTS. Golden Eye has Virtua Cop 2. Mario Kart 64 has Sega Rally or Wipeout. Zelda has Resident Evil, and so on. TEAM: At the time of writing, T.H.E. Games are still waiting to hear from Nintendo Co Ltd on release dates for N64. If Atari suddenly produced a game like Super Mario 64 for the Jaguar we'd find that first question a lot harder to answer. Here's your difference John: LETTERS Arguably the most offensive video game ever. POETRY IN BOWEL MOTION! Don't let Nintendo trick you. It's just a clever marketing ploy. You probably won't print this letter as you all seem to be so wrapped up in the N64 hype yourselves. Tom Pelly, Bardfield Sailing 2 TEAM: For as long as Nintendo keep producing unprecedented quality games for their system, who cares! No, seriously Tom has a point here no matter how great Nintendo's games are, it will be unrealistic of them to expect 64DD to be picked up by everyone. It's a popular misconception that the Japanese have all this money to burn on video games they're as shrewd and money conscious as anyone. Everyone might wish they could afford Zelda IV, but won't necessarily have the means to obtain it. Nintendo are trying to revive their market, and we hope they'll succeed. Here goes, This is something I gotta say, and if you print it, it'll make my day. The Sega Saturn is the best, it stomps from high on the rest. It's got games on it that are tantalising, enough to stop a homeboy vandalising. Quit your grafitti up on them walls, come down and let the Saturn grind up your balls. Playing Baku Baku might make you weep, but when you put it down and finally go to sleep, you'll find your high scores are yours to keep. Get a second pad and plug into Rally, put your foot down, don't dilly dally. Spin round those corners, kick up some dirt,\"Ow!\" the man says \"That gotta hurt\". If this is a star letter, and you want to take pity, that's wicked man, now send me SimCity. To all those station owners out there, It's time we made somethings all square. When it comes to sounds, NORELIEF you can't beat Sony, but their consoles are all but a phoney. I'm signing off now, this is all I'll say, and NO I ain't in Sega's pay. V Jackson, Doncaster. TEAM: Well, at least you're happy over there at the asylum "

RELEASED BY SEGA TEL: 0181 966 4620 he Saturn is already home to some brilliant football games (Euro 96 and Olympic Soccer spring immediately to mind), so for a soccer sim to be worthy of consideration its got to be something pretty darn special. Enter Sega, who in the quest to produce the definitive football simulation have taken the best bits from both these games (and more besides), added a dose of innovation and then mixed the lot into one super slick, visually stunning package. Has it worked? That's what we're here to find out... Over the past few months the Saturn has received a veritable deluge of footy sims, each one seemingly better than the last. Now its Sega's turn to take a shot at goal. VICTORY GOAL VICTORY OWN-GOAL?shop Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 is actually the Western name for Victory Goal 96, the Japanese sequel to the Saturn's first ever football game: Victory Goal. Don't worry If you can't remember it. It smelled. However, so superior is SWS 97 to its predecessor that it really doesn't deserve to be associated with the decidedly lacklustre original.

ALL THE TRIMMINGS b omman Adleet While the structure of most football videogames is generally written in stone (two goals, eleven men, etc), the exact nature of the play mechanics vary from title to title. On the one hand you have the 'realistic simulation' approach, as demonstrated by games like Fifa 96; while on the other hand you have the 'unrealistic arcade' approach, witnessed in games like Olympic Soccer and Striker. Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 manages to walk the fine line between simulation and arcade, offering some of the most playable, yet authentic, football action ever seen in a videogame. High praise indeed! Danjoht As is the trend with sports simulations these days, SWS 97 features a ton of options that allow players to customise the game to their precise requirements. You can play a one-off exhibition match, a mutli-team tournament or even take part in a worldwide league championship. You can pick your players, team strategy and formation. You can choose which stadium you want to play at, what weather conditions you want to play in and what camera angle you want to play from.

SWS 97 is no exception. However Sega have taken the opportunity to go one step further by introducing some truly 'special' moves that require a predetermined D-pad sequence to perform, normally when you're in possession of the ball. With practice a player can fool his mark with a dummy step, trap the ball in midfield, move around a defender with a well timed one-two, or even flick the ball up over his head!

Some news, hot from the future: In the year 2097, a probe ship from Earth discovers a beautiful new planet Tobal. Not only is the air breathable here, but beneath the surface there is found a valuable, energygiving mineral.

But Tomb Raider thinks otherwise. PlayStation ROM ast issue we revealed the first playable version of Core's Tomb Raider and told you that it was looking promising. The latest versions are even more impressive, with a few little glitches removed, and more levels and items added. The best way to explain how it plays is by saying it's a bit like Prince of Persia in 3D, along with a bit of Super Mario 64. It's got a lot of different styles included exploring, puzzle solving, shooting, tricky jumping, the lot! We're looking forward to seeing how the final version turns out. BOING! LOOK A DAT! Some sections of the Tomb Raider levels look incredible! The 3D engine means that it's possible to have one floor above another, unlike some 3D \"corridor\" games like Doom. All of the architecture and scenery is very realistic, and it's quite exciting to find a completely new section and discover an amazing-looking underground cavern, or something. WE RAID CORE'S MOST VALUABLE TOMB! MORE GUNS! These bridges need to be crossed very carefully, as there are wolves below! These stairs lead down to a new section beneath the rest of the level. In the latest version of Tomb Raider, there are more weapons than the plain old pistols in the first version. Now Lara can use a shotgun, two magnums or even two uzis at once! All the weapons use the same shooting technique as the pistols, explained in the last issue. The moss-covered floor leads down to a dark dungeon. Do you jump down? These temples are incredible to look at. They are also really massive NOOS INIWOD GOING FOR A DIP 3 At times it's necessary to jump in the water and swim to get through the levels. This is one of the most impressive parts of the game, as the graphic effects are great a cool blue colour fills the screen and some pretty light refraction makes patterns on the walls beneath the water. Also, all of these effects are done just as well on each system. When beneath the surface, it's possible to look back up out of the water. It looks incredible! There's no time to hang around in the water on later levels this alligator will chomp you to bits if you're too slow! 22 "


"...BUT WHAT'S BETTER? computer video games COOL CUT-SCENES In the final version, there will be real-time cut-scenes linking certain sections of the game together, as well as developing the plot as you go on. At the moment, only a few are in the game, but they give you an idea of what to expect when everything's finished. Last month we just showed you pictures of the Saturn version of Tomb Raider. Now we've got the PlayStation version and a more recent Saturn disc as well. They are both coming on very well, and they look remarkably similar. The Saturn has got a bad reputation for handling 3D games, but does Tomb Raider easily as well as the PlayStation does. The screenshots on these two pages are taken from both systems try to figure out which is which. We think you'll have a bit of trouble. SEOA SATUR PlayStation PlayStatio Just out of interest, here's a picture of the PlayStation version next to the Saturn version. Remember that they're both a fair way from being finished and will end up looking even closer to each other. ROM HNNNNNNNNNNG! THE JUNGLE GYM One of the moves not used in the version of the game we showed you in the New Games section last month is Lara's ability to shift around giant objects. By holding one of the buttons when near a solid item, Lara braces herself. Then, by pushing towards or away on the pad, she can be made to push or drag the obstacle. The movement of Lara is incredibly realistic, and it's even more amazing when you remember that it's not been motion-captured! One of the new sections is the Gym, which allows the player to get used to Lara's many moves without worry ing about falling to their death or getting mauled by some horrible creature. Ramps and wooden boxes give Lara something to practice on. Figure out all of her techniques here before starting the game proper. > Downstairs from the main gym is this pool of water, which lets Lara practice swimming. The room it's in is very nicely decorated too! COMING SOON Lara really puts all her weight behind the push, using her hands, then turning around and shoving with her shoulders! YOU'VE BEEN CURSED! You shouldn't have read this far! You've now got the curse on you! Whatever you do, don't get excited about Tomb Raider, and don't look forward to the CVG review of the full game soon. And make sure you bathe in cat's milk every day. When pulling, Lara gets down low and drags the block along the floor. "

The premise is simple score points by matching blocks of the same design to vanish rows but the permutations are genius. Obviously Nintendo want as many people as possible to appreciate their work, as they've replaced previously unknown characters with the much-loved Yoshi Island brigade. Okay, it's safe to proceed... WIN FRIENDS THEN LOSE THEM This is a really appealing game. Soon as you start playing, other people become curious. And so a versus test of skills is required, in which case there is an option to make the action even more frantic in a perfectly controlled kind of way. BLOCK BUSTER STAGE WORD MAGICAL NEW NINTENDO PUZZLE GAME 10.15 NEED TO KNOW A heated exchange between sides! The game can be configured so that chain reactions have an adverse effect on the challenger's screen. Specifically this entails a solid block falling onto their stack, whose size is relative to the extent of the chain reaction. Only way to disolve its coating is to vanish adjacent panels. This keeps your fingers very busy. STAGE 10 HARE HARD Always we need to explain these basic, but brain-squashing rules, otherwise the rest won't make sense. The very simple rule is to prevent rows of panels from being squashed at the top of the 'well'. This is achieved by matching rows of at least three identical panels, horizontal or vertical. All the while the rows of panels are pushed up the well from the bottom so you have to move fast! There are ways of improving your chances, however, and, subsequently your score: SCORE CHALLENGE Another way to prove your skill 1 Go for the highest score to win! against another player is to race for points. This way the biggest chain reactions and lengths of rows contribute to a score counter, on which there is a time limit. When time runs out, the player with the highest score wins. We can't tell you how competitive this becomes! FOUR OR MORE 0202 Line up four or more panels to stop the lines rising for a few seconds. In fact only a moron would try for anything less. Fives are about average. TIME 025 HI-SCORE 2010 SCORE 1178 SPEED LV. Rows going up and across together. Clever! CHAIN REACTION LEVEL EASY Where one row of panels disappears, if another is formed in turn you get a chain reaction. The longer this sequence goes on the bigger the score multiplier! 005 COMING SOON Move the panels by moving the cursor over them and pressing a button.

This way players always have full view of what's happening. The effect is really subtle. Sometimes floors are made semitransparent too, where there is a slope down to a lower room. n issue #177 we introduced you to the adrenaline burner that is Overkill. Since that time Konami's Chicago division has refined the look and gameplay, to such an extent that it warrants a second presentation. You may also notice that this is another game to have its release date postponed, from September to November! ... Just to recap, Overkill is an isometrically viewed, one-player strategic shoot 'em up. A major partner to the resourceful gameplay is the SHOCK factor, meaning lots of blood as a result of what can only be termed extreme violence. There is a choice of four characters mercenaries paid by a future earth federation to confront an alien race from the planet Viscera 5. These 'people' (two are alien) are armed to the teeth with state-of-the-art weaponry. The pleasure in taking it to the Viscerians is all yours. It helps to see what's lurking below! Power-ups sometimes hide behind walls. TIME... TO DIE AGENT KREEC MISSION COMPLETED Most specialist weapons have had their application modified. First of all the Spider Mine, which crawls toward an enemy, can now be detonated by the player; whereas before it ran off a 'fuse'. Likewise standard mines have this feature built in. A cloaking device, which turns your character into a ghostly shade for around a minute, is much stealthier.

When guns are fired the owner is bathed in white light. A nice touch, we reckon. CONTROL REVISION SHHH BLINDING LIGHT! Our first report was pretty sketchy on smaller details, but now we can introduce you to some of the better tactics available to all characters. Just like in corridor games, mercs can strafe side-step while firing to dodge while attacking. We particularly like the way sneaking behind unwary guards can result in their sharp demise. Also mercs can drop from ledges it causes a tiny bit of damage but can surprise most enemies. SQUELCH! Walk over a corpse to leave red footprints behind. They fade within a second. BOO! NEXT MONTH... WE ALL SHALL DIE! ON YOUR KNEES! (NICE) Mercs have a greater chance of evading fatal wounds while strafing. It doesn't look high, but this drop is enough to cause a small amount of damage. A new animation has been introduced, whereby characters too close to an explosion get stunned. Waiting! But seriously, Overkill should be with us next month for review. Also we hope to bring you first images of the Saturn version which KCEC promise will be every bit as brilliant as on PlayStation. 30 "

An appropriate backdrop for the anarchic attitude of Nihilist, mostly thanks to Philips who are busy snapping up loads of potential hits for their '96/ '97 line up. Marketing potential aside, Nihilist is looking pretty cool in its own right best way to describe it is a sort of virtual Asteroids, hounded by seriously psycho opponents who may be human or CPU controlled. Seem like fun to you? Scoot this way... LAUGH AT MY FACE AND IL GRATE YOUR ASS ON MY NOZZLE TEMPEST MEETS ASTEROIDS MEETS... NIHILIST NIHILATING NOT A NELSON JOKE Like we said, the premise of the game is really simple enter a battle arena (M-Fluxii) swarming with enemy space craft (Kraals) and debris, then see who survives. In a one-player game, Nihilist adopts a missionbased approach in which long-serving, successful pilots have the chance to upgrade their ship between missions. However this customisation option depends on the amount of 'Kash' picked up during a mission. Getting used to the controls is easy, but for those who need a bit of practice there's a video game within this video game called Mandala. Gameplay here is exactly the same as anywhere else, the difference is that all action is viewed from a third-person perspective, allowing pilots to see where they are and what they are doing. THE JETTISONS 30. 000 Clear out, she's gonna blow! 1 Control is a cross between Doom and Asteroids! Use the mouse for direction, target missiles and fire lasers. One button is thrust, two placed either side affect roll. Simple. The rest is instinct. 2 An unlimited supply of missiles leaves pilots to worry only about survival instincts. Tactics, then, are reserved for collecting powerups which appear within the M-Fluxii speed-ups, hull boosters, and so on. When there's not much left of your ship, but you still want a fighting chance, there's the option to eject to safety. From here on you're left floating about in an 'escape coffin', a precarious but nonethe less entertaining situation. There are 1 two models: MK.1 is defenceless, and has no option but to await rescue from the mother ship; MK.2 on the other hand is equipped with lasers (albeit puny) and reasonably powerful thrusters. If you're flash enough to own one of these, and mad enough to take the chance, you can scoot about creating havoc among the larger ships. Only in a network game, however it's a bit stupid otherwise! COMING SOON IL CRIKA 3 There is a choice of 15 ships, in linkup mode. The more impressive ones you have to earn in a mission game. They vary in performance, as you might expect, from heavily armoured but slow, thru speedy but fragile as a paper aeroplane. NIHILISTIS With just minor bug tests in store for recent weeks, Nihilist is sure to be logging in for review next issue. It's looking cool, So we should have nice things too say about it. 32 An amazing attract sequence shows the grim consequences of being a crappy pilot! "

BY TRAVELLER'S TALES COMPLETE EGA DRIVE  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 16MBIT CART  RELEASED BY SEGA TEL: 0181 996 4620 OCT RELEASE 1 PLAYER EGA RIVE Sonic fans have had a hard time since Sonic and Knuckles in 1993, without a single game starring Mr. Hedgehog. But now... SONIC 3D ince our New Games feature on Sonic 3D in issue 177, a lot more has been added. All the zones are now in place, with lots more new features and badniks for us to show you. While the graphic style is similar to the original Mega Drive Sonic games, it plays totally differently. Rather than run to the right of the level jumping on platforms, the game involves a lot more exploration Sonic must find five Flickys at a time and drop them off to open up new sections. It's flickin' Sonic innit! TRICKY FLICKYS! As we mentioned in issue 177, the object of the game is to collect five Flickys and lead them to the drop off point in order to open up more of the level. These Flickys are found inside baddies, and must be chased once freed. This can be tricky to do, as they wander around first, each with different attributes Red ones hop about, Green ones run away, Blue ones move, slowly,etc. RINGS 17 TOOT TOOT SONIC WARRIOR! RINGS 29 banon ZONE DRONE 0000000000 1. GREEN GROVE ZONE As always, the first zone gives players a chance to get used to the new controls and play style by having wide open spaces, few baddies and some simple secrets. 2. RUSTY RUIN ZONE This zone, set around a ruined palace gardens, has got lots of tricky jumps, spikes and baddies. For the first time in the game, one of the extra characters is used to progress Tails stands by a blocked passageway, waiting to be handed 50 gold rings or more. Once he's got enough, he magically lets Sonic pass! RINGS 3 RINGS 12 BINGS 29 MOBI 29 MOOD modo D 3 MOOD COMING SOON 1 By standing on these rotating panels, Sonic gets turned into a spinning top... These cannons fire Sonic and the Flickys around the level! 1 Enabling him to break through these pillars which block the way to the end of the level and extra powerups! 1 This hill is too steep for even Sonic to run up! He has to bounce from springs to ledges to get up. RINGS 26 3. SPRING STADIUM ZONE Every Sonic game's got a bouncy pinball level, and here's Sonic 3D's. The spikes and bumpers make it one of the most annoying. No, make that THE most annoying zone in the entire game! Aaaaargh! LEFT: Here, players have to bounce from balloon to balloon to get across a pit of spikes. The balloons pop on impact so it must be done right first time. RIGHT: This section's like a giant pinball table, with massive bumpers and loads of bouncy bits to throw Sonic about! 6666666 O "


"BINAS 13 SONIC AND KNUCKLES. AND TAILS AS WELL. computer video games MEGE DRIVI If players search the levels well enough, they may discover a few of Sonic's pals, like Tails and Knuckles! Sonic can give these characters his rings, and once they've got a total of over 50, something special happens. At the moment, the Special Stages aren't in the game, but in the final version you'll either be warped to one of these, or extra sections of the level will open up. In the Diamond Dust Zone, Sonic can get frozen in ice then pushed down a hill through the level! BINGS 3 4. DIAMOND DUST ZONE A very cool (prrp!) icy zone with slippery floors, ice flows and objects hidden in the snow. RIMGS 26 WARNI 1 Here's a giant ice flow running right through the middle of the level! This snowman badnik shoots snowballs at Sonic until he's destroyed... OOOOO Then a Flicky frozen in ice drops out! mo F. VOLCANO VALLEY ZONE A zone full of lava, with fire flares and secret tunnels hidden under rocks. T'S A MEE! THE EVIL DR. IVO ROBOTNIK! As we've come to expect from Sonic games, the evil Robotnik (Eggman in Japan) appears at the end of each zone. Once you've worked out how to beat him, get in about five hits and it's all over! Then again... BIOS BINGS 17 TOOT TOOT SONIC WARRIOR! 08 This line of flames rotates like a skipping rope, only Sonic doesn't just scrape his shins if he messes up he loses all his rings! 23 MOS These lifts need to be 1 One of the most valuraised by spinning on the able items in this zone is rollers. If Sonic gets off the Fire Shield, as it prothe wrong way he ends up tects Sonic from all of the in the lava! flames AND lava! RINGS 2 6. GENE GADGET ZONE The final zone with lots of electronic traps, laser guns and suction tubes which fire Sonic around the levels! This is one of the trickiest bosses as Sonic can't actually hit Robotnik. A bit of brainwork is required to figure it out, then it's rock hard to do! 2 GOOD 1 These fans blow Sonic into the air on his back, leaving him open to enemies. TURN IT UP! GET DOWN! The music is already pretty much in place, and is in the traditional Sonic style, meaning that you'll start humming it after only five minutes! And, like NIGHTS, the second act music is a slightly different mix to the first act's! X2 MOMO These are the tubes which take Sonic to later parts of the level at very high speeds. The floor here is electrified, and sparks a split-second after Sonic walks on it. This means that if he runs fast enough he can avoid dying! NEXT MONTH... COSMIC ETERNITY! COMING SOON 0 There's not too far to go before Sonic 3D is finished the bonus stages need to be added, and a few other things will be changed slightly, but hopefully this will all be done in time for a review next issue.  00000000 41 "

We announced the imminent arrival of Final Fantasy VII five months ago in issue #174. We knew this was going to be something special.

Set across five massive stages, Russia is under the control of a mad Russian General who is out to use the USSR's military stockpile to seize control of the world. Needless to say, you and your state-of-the-art helicopter are all that stands between him. Mission objectives must be completed before the mad sod presses the button to begin World War III! SOVIET STRIKE CLASSIC IN THE MAKINA LATEST IN EA'S CLASSIC STRIKE SERIES Launched in 1991, Desert Strike mixed shooting action with tactical elements, as the player guided a detailed heli sprite over isometrically-scrolling stages. Timed to coincide with the recent events of the Gulf War, the game's missions saw the player trying to eliminate a Saddam-like dictator, while blowing away his tin pot army along the way. Next came Jungle Strike, where the game took place across a number of, you guessed it, jungle-based stages. This time players occasionally abandoned the helicopter for a boat. Tougher missions and enhanced graphics made Jungle most peoples' favourite. Sadly, in adding Commando/lkari Warrior stages to the game's citybased stages in the follow-up Urban Strike made it little more than a disappointing cash-in. MISSION PROBABIE DESTROY! Soviet Strike spans five linked scenarios, as players edge toward the mad man's base by targeting key areas he is using to expand his power. Missions are detailed in superb FMV sequences, and the player is left to pick which weapons they feel necessary for the journey with all the old 'Strike' faves present in revamped form. Players find themselves blowing up reactors creating plutonium for warheads, strafing enemy bases, and sinking huge fleets of boats. Such is the level of detail that when a tank is wasted the sprites burn realistically, while soldiers run around EH GRINGO! as they burn before collapsing! GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY BULLETS! COMING SOON "


"computer video games WHAT A LOOKER PlayStation No boats in the gully today. Must have seen a war coming. Look at the trail behind that rocket. Most game intros don't look as good. SATUR Graphics in Soviet Strike are unlike anything seen in the series so far. All the landscapes are rendered in such detail, that the rolling fields look just as they should, while all the mountains and cities are intricately drawn with correct light sourcing for added effect. The level of detail extends to the sprites, too. EA's American development team have attempted to make Soviet Strike as realistic as possible. As such the tanks are based on the real thing, with all weapon and payload data lifted from books. If a helicopter attacks, it only has a set number of missiles before it has to return to base to restock. Similarly, this allowed EA to flex their design muscle with a number of tank styles as opposed to the 'one size fits all' vehicles of the 16-bit series. The benefit of such detail is more satisfying to blow things up, and strafing an inhabited city is so much more gratifying when they crumble realistically, and people leg it to supposed Examine the satellite pics safety. for signs of activity. Explosions light up the sky. Debris flies from the wreck. Scenery which looks this good is only possible by streaming it from CD. BURE LATEST IN EA'S CLASSIC STRIKE SERIES USJIDUD You would be able to recognise this man if you saw him. Is this him? Well, if he were to wear a woolly hat and mask... VIEW TO AKUN EA were determined to keep the action as close to the virtually faultless controls of Jungle Strike, so the helicopter scoots around with minimal inertia, and all past abilities such as picking up extra ammo, fuel and hostages with a winch system. The default view follows an isometric view which keeps the player's helicopter central at all times, but a secondary mode has also been included. This second option allows the user to opt for a view where the helicopter skirts around the edge of the screen, with the assorted targets kept in the centre of the screen. EVIL FETICE! BRIDGE DOWN!! KIB00L Strategy is every bit as important as bloody-minded kill 'em all tactics. Air to ground missiles are limited in supply but very effective.

"computer video games ROM Multi-player videogames have always been some of the most excellent gameplay experiences you can get ever since the day that Gauntlet introduced simultaneous four-player gaming to the world. With the advent of PCs and console link-ups, it's about to become a revolution... and videogames will never be the same again. THE NET REVOLUTION! CO25120 n 1993, videogaming as we know it got a powerful kick in the ass, the ramifications of which are only just beginning to take effect. Before the landmark release that was id software's Doom, multi-player games were very limited affairs. Typically two players sat at the same machine beating away at each other in one-on-one combat games, or got together to fight the meanies in titles like Gauntlet, (shudder) Quartet or even Galaxian3. So what was so great about Doom? Well apart from the landmark visuals and isolation from other players (finally your opponents couldn't see what you were up to), it had the distinction of playing totally differently from the one player version of the game. Rather than rely on samey computer intelligence or randomised nonsense, the gameplay arena was shaped by what a bunch of humans did. To each other. With large highcalibre weaponry. The other thing going for it was the number of player involved. The original Doom coped with four players only, but it was still amazing. Every game was different. There was always a new challenge. It was a warzone and only the greatest gamers survived. Armour up and take on anyone Another one-on-one shotgun in close-quarters combat. The doufest, and the armour and health ble-barrel shotgun is best here. levels are getting a bit low... THE NET REVOLUTION! However, the PC continues to blaze the trail. Kali is a system designed to let the Internet behave like an IPX network. Basically any networkable game can now be run from the home without the expense or the hassle of lugging your equipment about. The global aspect of the net can slow things down badly, hence the arrival of direct dial-up systems which are no different at all from normal IPX play. Most exciting of all is id software's Quake. A game designed to be able to network with anything direct link, modem, IPX, Internet. You name it, Quake does it. And it's also the best game as well, the perfect marriage of hightech and good old fashioned gameplay. THAT WAS THEN... There was only one problem with Doom. For starters, you needed a fifteen THE BIG QUESTION hundred quid PC to play it on and secondly, you needed an IPX network to hook up with other players. That kind of kit comes to about .500 limit When we moan to companies about their new console games not being multiing Doom at its best to large companies that used that kind of kit. player, the stock response we get is: \"no-one can be bothered carrying a TV However, it shaped the future of multi-player games because the powerful and a console round to their mate's house\". Or: \"multi-player is only played people in the software industry did have access to that kind of technology. by journalists\". Whilst this is clearly rubbish when talking about PC multi-player games (thanks to the Internet and modems), does it really effect console owners that much? Do you guy lump your PlayStations around your mate's to THIS IS NOW... play Doom? Or is it really all a waste of time and programming? Write into CVG's lovely letters page now. The rampant popularity of Doom set up the parameters for the ultimate multi-player experience awesome 3D visuals, a player with their own machine and screen, plus unparalleled gameplay which rewarded good playTHE BOTTOM LINE ers by humiliating the bad ones. What PCs could do in 1993, the consoles could do now, albeit on a much smaller scale. Hence the arrival of If you're a diehard gamer, you just can't ignore the multi-player gaming revoluPlayStation (and Saturn soon) Doom, which brought quality multi-player tion that is going on out there and whilst you might get some enjoyment out gaming to the masses. of console link-up games, nothing can touch the PC for real multi-player WILTUMCU CIOCO MADS06E ROCHST GIVE 54 The rocket launcher can easily take out two or three foes with its blast radius. The entrails haven't hit the ground yet, and two more frags have already occurred! Shooting someone in the back is fun. Shooting two people in the back is... nasty. "


"QUAKE computer video games The latest id software classic is perhaps the greatest networking game you'll ever have seen. It has been designed to play in any kind of multiplayer environment whatsoever. And it's very easy to get to grips with too. ROM A bunch of players are thrown into the same level and the objective is simply to tool up on health, armour, ammo and weaponry and then blast the hell out of each other. Despite the apparent simplicity of the game. it's one of those games that you will never completely master. Like Street Fighter, there will always be someone with better techniques. That, coupled with the fact that these are human players you are battling, combine to make Quake one of the premier videogames experiences ever! In any multi-player environment, Quake rules. For two players with a linkup cable (or over the modem), it's brilliant (although it can be limited). But where you really need to play Quake is on a network. Any kind of network will do, although for best results, an IPX net is best. Unfortunately, to play a decent four-player game of Quake you're looking at  worth of PC equipment! Thankfully, the amount of CyberCafes opening up (see the piece later on in the mag) means that you can have access to this brilliant game for the minimum of cash. The alternative to this IPX malarkey is to go for the Internet, which just about any PC owner with a modem and a phone socket can take advantage of 20 597 1 AMMO | HEALTH IFBAG PARMOR TL 100 Doom revolutionised the multi-player scene, with the sequel (Doom 2. pictured on these pages) taking the action to its next logical progression. The latest version, Final Doom, runs under Windows 95 and allows you to play over the Internet too! AD HEALTH I FRAG Doom 2, level one. One of the greatest multi-player scenarios ever envisaged by man...     ... Packed full of weaponry of devastating power. As this rocket launcher adequately shows. BANTINGS THE MASTEN DRED POPEVE VENCE 11 FARSBACH action. At the moment, we'd be the first to admit that this is out of the reach financially of most people. A PC that can run Quake well is expensive enough, but add in modems, phone charges and Internet bills and it quickly becomes a pretty exclusive club. However, things are changing. The Saturn's going to benefit from a netlink and the multi-player action that comes with it and plans are still afoot for a PlayStation network that could see eight-player games! The way we see it, you've got two choices. The first is to hang about and wait until it all becomes cheap or you can get off your fat ass and visit a CyberCafe! These establishments have all of the expensive) kit set up for THE NET REVOLUTION! A madman takes on The Master armed only with an axe (top left). The Master and minion catch a hapless red player in a cross fire in this red vs yellow team battle (top right). A rocket up the staircase catches a red in the cods (bottom left). The result is beyond doubt victory for The Master OF COURSE (bottom right). CONSOLE LINK-UP ACTION! PLAY QUAKE ON THE NET! Okay, so you haven't got the necessary sponds to kit yourself up with a top-end PC and internet connection. That needn't matter, as two of the three major console suppliers have designed their machines with true multi-player gaming in mind. PLAYSTATION The PlayStation's much vaunted link-up capabilities are excellent. Games like Descent, Ridge Racer Revolution and Wipeout are so much more fun when played with human opponents. However, the game that truly started the multi-player revolution Doom remains the best link-up facility you can get. If you've access to an Internet account, you can play 16 player DeathMatches too. The easiest method is to run Quake through Windows 95 and connect to your net service provider there. After that you choose one of the Quake servers dotted around the globe and get to it. THE PROS: A near-limitless supply of opponents and games to choose from. THE CONS: Internet response is slow if you're the average player with a modem. Even servers situated in the UK can be at least three times slower than playing a one-on-one link-up game. Quake World (see the box) should change this. PING PONG SATURN Currently the console with the meekest of link-up capabilities, this is all set to change. Noted titles Doom and Hexen are on the way (and should make use of the link-up cable, which will finally have a reason to be released). Rumours persist of Virtual On using the cable to. A link-up cable is available in Japan, but only has one game using it (crappy old Gebockers). Sega are embracing the Internet which should open up plenty more multiplayer options and X-BAND (a modem connection) is heading for Saturn. Virtua Fighter Remix, Sega Rally Plus and the new Daytona all support it. Until Quake World comes along though, it is possible to sort out your speeds to get a pretty playable game. Typically, speed is measured with a \"ping\" (type it any time at the console). The number you see next to your name is the typical response time between you pressing a button, that command being sent to the central server and the response returning to your machine. A ping of 350ms (that's about a third of a second) is just about acceptable and any Internet account can handle this when connecting to UK or some European servers. Some Internet service providers are setting up their own members only servers. Well, two actually. CIX is an on-line service currently promoting their Quake server. This provides super-fast response (a ping of around 150ms can occur), but unfortunately with CIX you get charged 4p per minute, equating to .40 per hour! We would recommend setting up a U-NET Internet account. They have two dedicated servers (which will increase with demand) and you can GULLIVEE NINTENDO 64 Nintendo have a very definite image of multi-player gaming and it all comes down to using the same screen and the same console. This is the type of blinkered attitude that Doom was thought to have overcome when it first appeared on PC (ironically N64 Doom is single-player only). However, the costs (and hassle) of console link-up could well make Nintendo's limited solution (four players on one machine) the most popular solution. 55 "

CVG would just like to add that although link-up gaming on the super-consoles is fun, it's nothing compared to a Quake 16 player DeathMatch! Unfortunately, it's a bit out of the reach of the average gamer... until now. Numerous \"CyberCafes\" are springing up across the country, all of which feature Pentium PCs networked up with all the brilliant PC games on their hard-drives. Usually that includes Quake.

"GREAT MULTI-PLAYER GAMES FANIKINGS computer video games NASTER ULLEREDARSince the early eighties, multi-player games have been some of the most phenomenal experiences you have can have with your PC. Some of the later games like Duke Nukem, Quake and Doom are either out (or will be out) on the consoles. Tion ROM MUD A simple text adventure with multi-player action. Amazing for the time. The great granddaddy of all multi-player games. Text adventures still exist over the Internet now. Hundreds of them in fact, based on anything from Marvel Comics to Star Wars. The lack of graphics and immediate action is offset by the increased imagination and accessible action. Some of these games have almost developed into worlds of their own, increasing in mythos and size as the years have progressed. FIREPOWER Back in 1988 when the Amiga first came out, Firepower supported splitscreen, link-up AND modem! Surely this was the first such game? Firepower spawned Return Fire, which stripped out a lot of the multi-player bits. Boo! POPULOUS Bullfrog have always been into multi-player games, and this God game was brilliant with link-up. Destroy your opponent's followers by levelling his land, striking them down or creating huge volcanoes... until they're all dead. Most amusing. Once the Quake level is complete, a full list of rankings is displayed as the next stage is loaded. In this six-player DeathMatch, it would appear that (once again), The Master is victorious with a crushing nine frag lead! FREER IRO WAS GIEDU 11 FALCON One of the first simulators to feature link-up. Spectrum Holobyte later produced the Electronic Battlefield, where you could ride a tank in one game and go up against your mate flying an aeroplane in another. AIR WARRIOR The first on-line simulator. A simple aerial dogfight played out first over modem dial-up and then with the aid of the Internet. DOOM The game that revolutionised it all. As the main text will tell you. THE NET REVOLUTION! DU HEALTH I FRAG The key to net Quake is to prioritise. Weapon first (in this case the chain nail gun) followed (very swiftly) by armour. Then run around in a frenzy killing people. Armour is actually more important than health as it wears down at a slower rate. stay on-line for as long as you like with a once-monthly payment of  (plus VAT). Contact U-NET on 01925 633144 ID INTRODUCE QUAKEWORLD! SIG 100% ARRO HEALTH Bol HEALTH ZERO TOLERANCE A Doom clone for the Megadrive. Not too great at all, but did have its own link-up cable (via the joypad ports). The only game of its type for the 16-bit machine, this represented the first real attempt to bring Doom to the massmarket. COMMAND AND CONQUER With the aid of Kali, playing C&C over the Internet was a brilliant tactical experience. Newcomer Warcraft 2 is also proving immensely popular. id software have realised that Internet Quake (although awesome fun) is not all it could have been but lead programmer John Carmack has plans to change all of that. Quake World is the name of the new net Ouake code id are working on. So what's the deal? To begin with, the slow response from the net will be worked around meaning that the game should look and move just like the single-player game. There will still be some delay (noticeably when firing at opponents), but it will be tons better than it is at the moment. Secondly, every DeathMatch player will be part of a global community. Every frag will be logged at id's central server and from that, information (such as top ten players in the world, best frags per minute score, longest uninterrupted game) will be made available to all players. It won't be free, but currently id is talking about a low ($10) one-off amount. Quake Internet is pretty awesome as it is, despite its faults. With the introduction of QuakeWorld, it won't be that much different to playing on a dedicated network! QuakeWorld is currently in the final stages of coding at id. More details next month. DUKE NUKEM 3D An IPX only network game, but with Kali you can play this over the net as well. Surpasses Doom's multiplayer action with double the amount of players and weaponry. Plus better graphics too. Like Doom and Quake, an unmissable multi-player experience. UNIVEE w 9209AO here QUAKE WORLD QUAKE CLANS id are already advertising Quake World on their web site. Gatecrashing a one-on-one battle and killing everyone. 57 "


"computer video games 3D SHOOTING BY ID SOFTWARE CD ROM Es presents en  PRICE $44.99  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  N64, SATURN AND PS VERSIONS PLANNED STORAGE 1 CD  PUBLISHED BY GT INTERACTIVE TEL: 0171 258 3791 OUT NOW 1-16 PLAYERS ROM You may think that video games ended with Super Mario 64, but that's only the beginning of the revolution. Chapter two: Quake! It's not a good idea to use the rocket launcher at this range! U AKU HIGHES he shareware version of Quake, reviewed in the last issue, has caused a storm already. But those of you thinking that you've just got the best game ever for free are wrong the full version is far superior! You NEED the CD for the amazing sounds, you NEED the six excellent deathmatch levels, you NEED to be able to run the homemade patches, and you NEED the awesome three final episodes! You know what? You NEED this game! SIX OF THE BEST! Anyone who plays Quake in multi-player and thinks that the shareware version is enough for them is wrong these deathmatch levels are essential! The first three are slightly edited versions of the OTEST levels, and the next three are totally new created especially for deathmatches!  The first QTEST level, now named The Place of Two Deaths, is good for just two players as it all loops around to the main dungeon room here. There aren't many weapons in it just the Nail Gun, Super Shotgun and Grenade Launcher.  The fourth deathmatch level not only has the best CD track of the lot, it's also one of the most fun. There's a lot of lava, so frags can easily be knocked off by running around carelessly. Also, there are lots of ledges, leading to plenty of sniping fun!  The second level has actually got a new section, added since the QTEST version. There are also more power-ups including the Quad Damage to use. As before, there are switches to drop other players in the lava or to crush them in certain rooms!  This underwater section in The Cistern is great. If you get the Pentagram of Protection and the Lightning Gun (which are right next to each other), then jump in the water, you can fry everyone else in there with you in a single shot! There are also long corridors running around the perimeter. REVIEW  Does this look familiar? It's the outside section from The Abandoned Base one of the original QTEST deathmatch levels! The water is dirtier than before, making it easier to hide there! This level's best for at least four players it's amazing with 16! * This level is one of our favourites, as it's got every weapon, lots of hiding places, and almost every route ends up in the middle. There's also a Ring of Shadows for extra comedy! Here, someone's gone invisible, meaning that you have to shoot at the floating eyeballs! Nasty! 58 "


"computer Video games ...THERE'S MORE! As we expected, Quake editing has taken off already! It's now possible to pick up brand new levels created from scratchthough these are still a bit basic as a simple level editor has yet to be released. There are also some incredible patches available to give the player new abilities, weapons, modes just about everything! Here are a few of our favourites: ROM GRAPPLING HOOK The axe now fires an elastic rope of nails with a spike on the end which sticks to any wall or ceiling, then pulls the player in at high speeds! This means that you can swing across pits. hang from the ceiling, and reach areas which would usually take ages to get to! And in deathmatch mode it changes the style of the game totally, as players swing around levels, attempting to catch each other on the end of their hook! The Enforcers are cool. There's already a patch available to give you their blaster gun! AXE OF COMMANDMENT COMMENT This excellent patch turns the axe from being an offensive weapon into a magic tool which converts any monsters touched with it into friends! Once someone has joined your team, they follow you about the level until they spot an enemy then they attack! It's great fun to have a gang of Grunts and Rottweilers following you around the level, only to have them run on ahead and wipe everyone else out! Awesome! What Quake offers is far greater than just a game. It's a truly immersive experience starring yourself in a totally escapist environ ment. And if it doesn't do what you want it to do, then make it. This game can be shaped anyway you want and I can't wait to see what people make it become. Yes, I still love (and play) NIGHTS over any other game, and Mario 64 is unlike anything seen. But Quake offers the greatest 'game engine' ever made. Perhaps I should describe it as the best game yet to come... TOM GUISE HOMING MISSILES The homing missiles are unfair, but great fun! The missiles move slower than usual, then lock on to a bad guy and fly straight to them even round right-angles! Once they hit, the target explodes in an even bigger shower of guts than usual! MORE TEXTURES REVIEWER This is a collection of textures which the player can switch between at any time, changing them into the Terminator, a Stormtrooper, Henry Rollins, Captain Picard, and more! There are also patches to make powerups turn players into Fiends; a gun which fires heads and other body parts; pipe bombs, proximity mines, grenades which fire nails when they explode absolutely anything is possible with this game! ER & VIDA WHAT'S THIS? IT'S GOT A GOOD BEAT! IT'S A GODDAM REVELATION! PUTER COMP GAMES If I wasn't writing about this game, and I was instead telling you about it in person, I'd probably fall over and start crying about now! It truly is one of the most incredible games I've ever experienced it's a revolution! Not only is the one-player mode magnificent featuring possibly the most incredible graphics of all time, Mario 64 included but the multi-player mode is probably the best video games experience of all time! To be playing in a 16-player deathmatch with people from the USA, Sweden, South Africa, and all over the world just from your bedroom is amazing! You can make friends and enemies, play seriously or just type insulting messages you can really be yourself! Then there's the small point of Quake being the most customisable game of all time, leaving players to do just about any. thing they want to the graphics, sound or entire gameplay engine! Of course, many people are only going to play the game in one-player mode, which is no bad thing at all the sound effects and amazing CD \"music\" compliment the amazing levels perfectly and don't forget the wealth of new levels and modes which are entirely free once you've bought the full game! It's not often that a video game is good enough for us to recommend that someone buy a console simply for it, but Quake is so incredible that you really should do your best to get a ,000 PC to play it. It's worth selling all your other games for. ED LOMAS Another thing that you can only get if you buy the full registered version of Quake is the Nine Inch Nails CD soundtrack to go with Trent Reznor's other masterpieces the Quake sound effects. You may have expected lots of noisy, heavy music, but it's actually some of QUAKE the most awesome ambient noises ever in a game! Most of the levels have droning noises, interspersed with strange effects, rumbles and screams, adding loads to the atmosphere of the game. In fact, it makes everything far more creepy than ever! Whatever you do, make sure you get this CD version as the game's just not the same without it! Last month we awarded Super Mario 64 a brand new accolade the CVG Revelation for being VELATIO such a landmark in terms of quality video games. We also said that it was unlikely that such a revolutionary game would ever come along again, but we were wrong. Quake has not only set an incredible example of 3D graphics. but has also rewritten the entire script on multiplayer games. And Quake also shows us the real future of video games with its revolutionary world-wide Internet capabilities, so we are awarding the Revelation again. Don't let anyone tell you that this isn't one of the best times for video games ever. REVIEW HUGENIJE TANIA RATING RATING OXX Quake isn't just a PC game it's THE game, full stop. It revolutionises video games, as well as being more fun than anything else. 59 "


"computer video games ACTION STRATEGY BY BULLFROG  PLAYSTATION AND SATURN VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  PUBLISHED BY EA TEL: 01753 549442 OCT RELEASE 1-8 PLAYERS ROM ROM In Quake, you don't know what's lurking around each corner. In Syndicate Wars the true danger is seen from a bird's eye view. We're not sure which is worse! SPITDICATE THE CORPORATE WARS SPIDICATE ave the storyline for later. Syndicate Wars has been a long time coming and we expect there are people reading this who have been revisiting the original of late, just to revitalise those reflexes and sharpen that steely nerve. For many who are familiar with the visceral, yet coolly intelligent gameplay of Syndicate, this release is every bit as significant as Quake. You might scoff. You might also want to try your hand at the game it's very special indeed. THE CORPORATE WARS Purge the streets of the opposition's agents! ARE YOU SITTING COMFORTABLY? CHURCH OF THE NEW EPOCH To Syndicate Wars the plot is crucial. Failure to grasp the thread could find you out of it in no time at all. 95 years have transpired since the events in the first Syndicate, and that time lapse has SOI LAUGH AT forged some interesting developments: Chips placed inside the heads of the MY BOOTS mass population have begun to malfuncWOULD YAI tion, with citizens waking up in shock to the horror of their surroundings. This is no accident, and can all be explained as follows: Secret experiments with mind-expansion techniques in Iceland had an adverse affect on nine of the world's top scientists involved. They became hyper aware of the oppressive nature of the Syndicate's despotic regime, and sought to come against it. So they formed some kind of religion, using their insane new intelligence to create a new technology for weapons, and post a computer virus to crash the Syndicate's control network. THERE IS ANOTHER Whoever the player chooses to side with, there is a common enemy, in the form of the tenth scientist who escaped insanity at Reykjavik. His name is Vissick, and he is now the leader of a renegade biker gang called the Unguided. Kind of Greenpeace ideals, without the humanity. BASICALLY THE SYNDICATE REVIEW Rotate the screen to view the cool action behind this building. Surely even Bullfrog would admit that Wars requires advanced manual dexterity and incredible wit to survive. To control, players use the mouse to scroll around the city scapes, pointing and clicking on areas to direct their posse of agents. One fundamental option selects individuals or groups of agents to direct, and each agent is assigned their own equipment, which also needs monitoring. To keep track of them as they move from target to target, the keyboard is used to adjust the viewpoint, so that the squad never becomes obstructed by architecture. There ought to be a special strap-on tea mug invented for use while playing this game! If the Syndicate can rehabilitate the COTNE leaders they can restore order. They have their own high-end technology to work with, enabling more than adequate weapons research labs. Players begin the game as a Syndicate leader, managing their initial missions, and putting into research new weapons and modifications to agents themselves. Unbeknown to the Syndicate, however, they have a COTNE double-agent within their midst. 60 "


"CUT AND DRIED computer games The game adopts the form of a series of missions. As we explained last month, the way in which these missions are carried out affects any subsequent briefings. Typically this might mean that one of your prized agents is gunned down during a recce, but twists in the plot can be much more complex and far reaching. It feels real, though there is obviously some kind of pre-ordained ultimatum. ROM The Syndicate versus the Church of the New Epoch. It's important to save as many agents as possible to progress. Explosions like this shake the floor. Look awesome too.  THE CORPORATE WARS SPITDICATE WE CAN REBUILD HIM Here you're looking at members of the church laying waste to a car. 11 ATE GRO 1 Success breeds power. Later in the game vehicles become available, making it so much easier to annihilate weak scum. Once agents have returned from a mission, hopefully they will have retrieved either a) loads of cash, or b) interesting devices usually weapons. These are applied to the development of your agents either through buying in more technology, or researching it yourself. Savvy players usually resist the urge to hand over cash for items which, through studying the mis sion briefing. they expect to recover from the field. REVIEWER First of all this is not an easy game, Straightaway the controls tell you that Wars is not for the joypad fraternity it's a PC game in essence and execution, meaning you need to be comfortable with advanced controls. No way is this a bad point, just that I don't expect the average NIGHTS player to get the hang of things too soon! Once everything comes together (doesn't take long) the experience is awesome. It's a unique thrill being in direct command of agents, while considering the bigger plan. In the midst of a street battle, the attention is focused directly on the immediate surroundings. And this life or death situation is scary. Above that though, the scale of the mission objective is what really drives you on. You want to be more sussed than the opposition. There is a definite need to make it back to base safely to savour the rewards. In a dark and very mature way, Bullfrog have nailed the essential ingredients of great gameplay right on the head. My only reservation is that it may prove inaccessible to fun-seeking, casual players., PAN DAVIES 1 Flamethrowers aren't standard issue. You need to research this kind of weapon. PAS REVIEW RATING 1 'Bank Jobs' are fairly well paid, insofar as gathering the smokey loot is concerned. An intense strategic shoot 'em up, which almost defies description. Another Bullfrog masterwork a must for all hyper-dexterous players!  61 "

Let's make a journey to the cave of monsters! Good luck! Liha INDDUD BUBBLE BOBBLE AND RAINBOW ISLANDS hat's the gibbering nonsense that greets us as we enter the fruit and nutty world of Bubble Bobble. Retro games may be popping up all over the shop at the moment, but unlike some of the more obscure (and rubbish) works crawling out of the gaming spawn pool, the Bubble Bobble games are definite classics that people have been crying out for. And now they're here (bar Parasol Stars), perfectly reconstructed. So come on, let's do as the man says and make a journey to that cave of monsters! 200 1201011001 BUBBLE BOBBLE DRULDU BUBBLE BOBBLE AND RAINBOW ISLANDS DENESESESSE SUGISISTUSSULTS. The original bubbling classic. It looks basic, but then it always has. The aim is simple. Controlling little dinosaur Bub (and his brother Bob if there are two-players), you have to leap about a single-screen level and wipe out all the baddies. To do this you just blow bubbles, trapping the monsters in them. They then float to the top where you can burst them for points, scattering goodies (sweets, cakes, jellies etc) about. Collect these for yet more points and move onto the next level. Again and again and again until you are dead! Or until you've done a hundred levels. RAINBOW ISLANDS ENHANCED BA The package also contains an updated version of Rainbow Islands. Thankfully, the gameplay has been left untouched. The graphics however, have been neatly spruced up with better colours and resolution, making everything look even sweeter! BUBBLE BOBBLE 2: RAINBOW ISLANDS REVIEWER Clearly the better of the two instalments, some would even claim this is one of the best games ever made. Even now it remains highly inventive and brilliantly entertaining. Controlling Bub (now turned human by some inexplicable magic), he has to reach the top of a series of vertically-scrolling levels. To do this, he creates rainbow bridges which he can walk over. These bridges are also his weapon either hitting baddies to yield goodies (cakes, jellies, turnips, beer etc) or trapping them underneath, where Bub can break the rainbow, releasing a power-up. Getting to the top of a level is fairly easy if you avoid most of the treats and baddies but gaining the skill to collect all the goodies, and turn the baddies into power-ups (eventually revealing secret islands), is what makes Rainbow Islands such a great game. 100000 Although I can remember them pretty clearly, I never really played either Bubble Bobble or Rainbow Islands much in any of their earlier incarnations. However, the lasting appeal of them especially Rainbow Islands is clear to me. In fact, Megadrive Rainbow Islands is still played by people in the office. So, while Bubble Bobble is a fun and diverting game, it's the Rainbow Islands conversion (or better still, the enhanced version) that makes this package so welcome. Even by today's standards (or maybe because of them), RI proves to be a fresh, superbly addictive and highly challeng. ing game. Many PlayStation owners may not think Rainbow Islands is their cup of tea. Fair enough. But if you hanker after some genius gameplay, this is more than a nostalgia piece it's a classic. TOM GULSE Eight islands, plus two secret ones. This is Horror Island. 3500 1 00000 UITTTTTTTTT REVIEW RATING RATING Og Here, Bub has gained the power to produce two rainbows. wani On the fourth stage of each island, you face the boss! Rainbow Islands is the star here. And it proves that a brilliant game is always a brilliant game. Excellent stuff! 62 "

"computer video games 3D SHOOTING BY WILLIAMS  PLAYSTATION VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD 1-8 PLAYERS OUT NOW O ROM . RELEASED BY GT INTERACTIVE TEL: 0171 258 3791 ROM COM Everyone's favourite gun-toting psycho returns to the PC for one last tour of duty. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you ... FINAL DOOM ith the gib-tastic Quake currently crushing all opposition in a situation not dissimilar to a Godzilla/Tokyo interface, it's fitting that GT should choose this month to bring to a close the chapter in gaming history that is «Doom». PC owners have been enjoying the delights of id's seminal 3D blastathon since 1993, and in the four years since then we've seen a number of official add ons (Doom2, Ultimate Doom, Doom: The Master Levels, Doom ) along with countless homebrew 'wads' and patches. Now both amateur and professional designers join together to write the tombstone for one of the most influential games of the decade. Carumba! Loads of Revenants at once! Uh-oh! It's an Arch-Vile and he's blowing you up! Look! A new texture on that block on the left! Wow! .: WINDOOM '95! GOING OUT WITH A BANG! FINAL DOOM Final Doom contains two all new 32 level episodes for you to battle through Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. That's 64 new levels in total! Both episodes feature a mixture of levels contributed by both professional level designers and amateur Doom fans. Though, to be honest, you'll never notice the difference. Final Doom features some of the most attractive, fiendish, and innovative Doom levels we ve ever seen and we ve seen 'em all! One of the more interesting features of Final Doom is that it comes complete with Doom 95 for use through Windows 95. While many gamers (including us) tend to avoid Microsoft's resource-sucking GUI like the plague, but for once there is an incentive to boot up Gates' money spinner. Provided you own a Pentium, Final Doom can be played in 640 X 480 resolution for the ultimate Dooming experience. Check out those Cyber Demons in hi-res! Also Doom '95 provides full support for internet play, something previous versions of Doom have sorely lacked. REVIEWER This is a hard product to review. Doom is, was, and always will be a classic game, no matter what format it comes in. However, two large obstacles stand in Final Doom's way. Firstly, Quake. Corridor games have moved on since 1993, and while Final Doom is still great fun to play, you'll find yourself looking for the jump button or mouse look option. Secondly, why would anyone want to pay for the privilege of 64 extra levels when there are literally thousands available on the internet for free? Admittedly, these levels are about as good as it gets, and the Windows 95 angle does add a new dimension, but the question of value for money still arises. If, like me, you still love Doom and can appreciate a brilliant ly designed level, then it's money well spent. Otherwise... Quake awaits! DAN JEVONS 1 This is The Plutonia Experiment. Look two Cyberdemons in cages! MEINET RATING RATING 1 This is Evilution. There are loads of baddies, along with Arch Viles! Aaargh! Here lies the remains of Doom. He fought well and died in battle. May he rest in pieces. 64 "

ALLE TBOL O G THE CORRIDORS ALIEN TRILOGY e'll have no more moaning about Saturn owners not having any Doom-style games for their machine anymore. Last month, Saturn Exhumed appeared and it was completely excellent. In the very near future we've got Hexen and Doom itself, with id involved in the conversion of the latter. And this month Alien Trilogy finally arrives. That's right, the hugely-successful tunnel-exploring, gun-toting formula of Doom, backed by the combined might of the three Alien movies. The thrill of experiencing the chilling onslaught of xenomorphic scum, just like it was in Aliens. PlayStation owners loved it, Saturn owners wanted it, and now they've got it! Let's rock! Well, there's no problem in the corridor department. Alien Trilogy is completely made up of authentic shadowy tunnels. The game combines the three films into one big game. starting in the colony base of Aliens, mov, ing onto the prison camp of Alien 3 and rounding up at the alien ship of | the first film. But since all three films were made up of dark corridors, so all the game's levels are too. Different textures, same lighting conditions, There's also areas lifted straight out the movies. The map room from Aliens and the dead pilot chamber from Alien feature. 700 THE ALIEN EXPERIENCE 10 11 If you re reading this review with avid interest, you ve surely seen the movie Aliens. In which case you probably have an idea in your head of what this game ought to be like. Dank dark corridors, motion detector bleeping as dots close in. Then a salivary sound above as shadowy fig. ures drop to the floor, before the staccato sound and strobe-like flash of a pulse rifle rips into the squealing aliens. Yeh, that's how it should be. So how close is the game to the movies? non 100 740 Shadows? Check! Tunnels? Check! Okay, move along. Ohmygoddamntarnation! Lights in these shadowy tunnels. 00TH O Living humanoids prawns. Yes, they were in the movies. O Blocky walking pumistones? Not in the movies. 100 100 Chorg C REVIEW ML HER Exploding ketchup satchets? In the movie lunch scenes. Boring, empty tunnel scenes? Yep, Alien 3. 't I know Tom Guise is hiding around here somewhere. Christ, he's above. Look, there's his prolapsed bowel hanging down! 1 Ha, this guy doesn't stand a chance against me with my TV shaped head and hand growing out of my chin. 66 "


"computer video games THE WEAPONS Fortunately the weapons are authentic to Aliens, not the other two. Otherwise you'd be hacking away with hatchets and cutlery. Starting off with your standard issue pistol, you should locate the shotgun as soon as possible. Next up is the flamethrower and, of course, the pulse rite is in there too. Adding to your armaments are various grenades. However, unlike in Aliens, you can't just fire willy-nilly at everything around. Strategic use of weaponary is essential from using grenades to blowing holes in certain walls, to making sure your more powerful guns aren't wasted on facehuggers. 701 400 10 ronde voete SATURN BER THE MOTION DETECTOR Primary tension inducing prop from Aliens, the motion detector sits on the bottom-right of your screen at all times. If you're expecting it to start bleeping rapidly though, with multiple tracers moving around on it. you're gonna be sorely disappointed. In fact it seems to only have a three metre range, as blips only appear when you can actually see the alien near you. The only time you really use it, is to tell you which side of your body a face-hugger is scuttling up. Completely useless. 100 100 700 700 W THERE 13 019 t Okay... I've got me detector. Yoiks, there's a blip. Ooh, it's closing in. 20cms and closing! 100 104 102 0.0 TDIENTE It shows up anything. Aargh, except eggs! Scream, a skindiver! No blips on my detector. Nope. I'm quite safe. ALIEN TRILOGY THE ALIENS REVIEWER Yep, the box you've been waiting for. The one which is going to tell you all about the super-fast Scutting insectoid creatures that leap spider-like from wall to wall, snapping out with their probisc cus jaws. Except they don't. Picture instead, grey blokes in costumes, staggering lethargically around in a vain attempt to lash out at you. Four simple hits with a shotgun does the trick. Later on, you get the dog aliens and, as a nice treat, the Mother Aliens. But, although tougher, they still pale in comparison to their movie-counterparts. Perhaps they're based on the guy in the costume from the Alien Wars thing at the Trocadero. Anyway, providing a much greater challenge are the human agents and samurai androids, who never appeared in the movies. on 100 101 I've always liked Doom. In fact, when the first shareware version came out all those years ago, it appealed to me because of its similarity to Aliens. So Alien Trilogy would seem to be just perfect. Well the idea might be, but the actual game doesn't quite match up to expectations. Graphically it's fairly impressive. The dark, moody scenery is very accurate to the movie. And all the sound effects are brilliantly authentic too. It's just the aliens that are a let down. Instead of scaring the hell out of you, they just lope stupidly around, waiting to be shot. It's only when there's more than one enemy (and in general, the tough ones aren't even aliens), when things start getting troublesome. But that's more annoying than exciting. I don't think Alien Trilogy has as much tension or entertainment value as Doom. It's not bad by any means (and if you're curious, it's near identical to the PS version), it's just not as great as it could be. TOM GUISE FOON 100 REVIEW BE 100 RATING Well, there he is. The hardest enemy of the lot. He's called a Samurai Robot. Sammy the Samurai Robot. BATING An atmospheric and enjoyable 3D shooting game, but it isn't as good as a 3D Aliens game really ought to be!

The aim is to confront a giant bird which has been terrorising the land. Only way to get there is by absorbing enemy power and solving small puzzles with it. ou know the main problem with platform games is that they're so predictable. So where they can't offer many surprises, the least they can do is show some signs of inventiveness. At its core, Kirby Superstar is a platform game sort of.

Kirby is remains one of may favourite characters because he is so versatile, plus his games always provide a lot of fun they genuinely make you laugh. Superstar is typical of what you might expect from Nintendo's 'second-party development team, Hal: odd-ball humour, and ingenious game design. You might wonder why such basic events as the Megaton Punch, and Samurai Contest are included. The simple answer is that they're a lot of fun to play. You'd miss them if they weren't there. Though I reckon the platform games are, once again, quite a breeze to get through, there's so much to figure out that keen players will want to keep plugging away.

And at $1.5 million per episode, it's one of the most expensive sitcoms around. It's also the hot favourite for funniest TV show ever made. It's the cartoon phenomenon known as The Simpsons. All about an inept, revolting, yet ultimately loveable family of yellow bug-eyed humanoids. Since its inception in a series of 20-second pre ad-break slots on the Tracey Ullman Show in America, it has rocketed to galaxyspanning mega-proportions. It's aired in over 70 countries and the sheer amount of spin-off merchandising is, well, quite unreasonable. In January it arrives for the first-time on BBC1, and the whole Simpsons craze is set to explode again. Guaranteed! Don't you wish you were behind it all? Well, on a smaller scale, you can.

"computer video games CARTOON TIME! BARTS BUMDRECTED AND FIMED BY ED LOMAS ESQ. Just to prove how easy it is to make a top-notch matinee without a shred of talent, here are some of the celebrated movies made by the budding directors here at the CVG studios. In which Bart Simpson drops his pants outside the Kwik-E-Mart and farts out banana skins, starfish, butterflies and apple cores. Tension mounts as school-bully Nelson tiptoes toward Bart's exposed rear, but a graphic finalé is denied as the end credits cut in. Instead, excellent symbolism is used as a giant chocolate donut is munched and Bart's scream is heard. Hitchcockian brilliance! THE SWEEPER BY DAVE KELSALL. ROM Occasionally a film comes along that far surpasses any other. That film is The Sweeper. Taken at face value, it is pathetically simple. Sweeper sweeps his way across the moon, collecting banana skins and monkeys. However, repeat viewings reveal a multi-faceted masterpeice. The perfectly-selected chase music, the meaningless kazoo sound the monkey makes, the bus bell that sounds as the sweeper leaves. Already it has inspired homages. A true masterpiece. Each exiting item is accompanied by a popping sound! 00000 FL A PHIL DAWSON FILM EDITED BY MR FINGER. One of the film's most sweeping moments ODDOO Proof that no multimedia package can be too easy for a moron, Fil is an prime example of movie making at its worst. Homer points at Marges bum, she cries out, they both vanish. After this, original footage featured Krusty arduously trundling along the bottom before laughing. However, this was cut in favour of a The End logo. Still unbearable though. THE END A VERY FUNNY CARTOON BY MP FINGER (AKA RAD) One of the earliest movies, and all the more impressive because of it. The surreal plot sees Homer electrocute himself at work and return home to speak to Madge in Bart's voice.

A package that gives you the chance to make your own Simpsons cartoons. It's a brilliant idea! It reminds me of when Super Mariopaint came in. Amazingly fun and easy to use, and the results are always hilarious. It's clear what a great laugh The Simpsons Cartoon Studio is, from the amount of people clamouring to make a movie. It's also staggering how impressive the cartoons you can make are. Unlike most PC 'toys' of this ilk, TSCS has a massive range of animations, sounds and effects, allowing you to really go mad. From early humorous scenes, we're now seeing more and more epic' movies being made. In fact, all I can think of right now is making my next blockbuster 'Invasion'. I'm also looking forward to the long-awaited follow-up to The Sweeper, and I hear a sequel to Bart's Bum is in the works. This is definitely an application anyone of any age will love. So much you want to investigate real animation. It's ace! A TRP TO HELL BY THE TOMINATOR, STAGE 7: MUSICAL SCORE AND DIALOGUE There's tons of speech (plus yelps, laughs, burps etc) for all the characters. Plus a multitude of soundeffects for all occasions. All the famous tunes can be cut together too, to create the perfect mood. On its release, this movie was a sprawling epic (clocking in at 463 frames, a record for its time). Principal Skinner runs off a cliff, falls into the sea, then hell, then gets up and waves goodbye. With its multiple locations, varied musical score and pioneering animation techniques, it's still incredibly impressive. However, other productions have since shown A Trip To Hell to be lacking in substance. A significant and memorable movie, but more a milestone than a classic.

"computer video games RPG BY ANCIENT  MEGA DRIVE PREQUEL AND JAPANESE VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  PUBLISHED BY SEGA TEL: 0181 996 4620 SATURN SEPT RELEASE 1 PLAYER SATURN The second scroll telling the story of Thor has been uncovered. It says \"It's much better than the one on the Mega Drive\". STORY OF THOR 2 ne of the things that puts most people off video game versions of Role Playing Games is the way that everything is so slow. Player characters normally need to move in turns, and fight in a similar way; but Thor plays more like Zelda real-time movement and fighting. Only this time, it's been created by the team that made the original Mega Drive Streets of Rage games, and has therefore got a slightly more advanced fighting system than Zelda. And you know what? It's good fun as well. A WARLORD'S WEAPONS! There are a variety of weapons to be found in the game, and there are quite a few moves to be performed with each of them. The special attacks are pulled off in a similar way to fighting games, with double-taps and pad rotations used in conjunction with the attack button. More moves are revealed by sign posts and other characters as the game goes on, meaning that by the end, you can be a real master of your weaponry! FEET OF DEATH Leon doesn't always need a man-made weapon he can also attack with his deadly plates o' meat! STORY OF THOR 2 PEEP PEEP. MY NAME IS LEON. PEEP PEEP. PLEASE HELP ME. JUMP KICK TRIPLE KICKFLIP The introduction sequence shows how the player needs to help Leon help everyone in his world to get the evil silver amulet from the even more evil Agito. Thankfully, the nice Chief Ordan has the magic gold amulet from Story of Thor, which is returned to Leon at the start of the game. Get to it, bub! STANDARD DAGGER The basic weapon is fine for use on early enemies, but isn't anywhere near as useful as the other weapons.

"computer video games BOW AND ARROW The bow is picked up early on and is useful for hitting unreachable switches and more dangerous baddies like the bosses! ASPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE One of the more interesting features of the Thor games is that Leon doesn't recruit extra team members instead he discovers helpful spirits of nature! These spirits stay with Leon and each have their own special powers and attacks. For example, Dytto the Water Spirit can heal Leon or other charac ters; Efreet the Fire spirit can burn objects and melt ice; and Bawu the Earth Spirit can eat just about everything or launch spores to attack! SAMURN ARROW LOB TRIPLE SHOT MAGIC ROD This isn't so much a weapon as an item. The dashing strike can be used to crack open certain dead trees, and when powered up with magic, it can be used to alter objects and destroy enemies in one hit! MAGIC SPELL DASHING STRIKE There are six of these spirits in total, and they all need to be found to get through the game properly. REVIEWER JONASWORD Found at about the same time as the third spirit, the long sword helps immensely! Its reach is good and it can also cause big damage! STORY OF THOR 2 SOHBE DY -... ROLLING ATTACK SPINNING SLICE The good thing about the original Story of Thor was that it could be played by even non-RPG fans normal people, in a similar way to Zelda, the player can move around in real-time, fighting people as they go with moves more like a beat 'em up, as well as having all the usual trails of an RPG. At the beginning of the game, there's always something to do you just have to follow a series of simple clues and commands but after a while it slows down. There are times where you need to do a lot of wandering and exploring, which is where the non-fans will start to get bored and the real RPG players will start to enjoy themselves. The whole game is fairly easy-going, and is a good blend of action and strategy, and there's also a fair amount of play in it. As an added bonus, the music is awesome it doesn't always fit too well with the game, but it's amazingly good quality! Overall, highly recommended to the RPG clan, with an almost equal recommendation to everyone else. ED LOMAS EAT ME! When baddies are destroyed, they will occasionally drop items for Leon to collect. Most of these are bits of glowing food, adding to Leon's health bar, but some are magic bits of grub like Giant Ginger which makes Leon giant, Tiny Thyme which makes Leon Tiny and Super Pepper which makes Leon super. Their uses will become clear with time. REVIEW RATING A great blend of action and adventure to appeal to more people than the average RPG ever will. 73 you buy it.

Once you've got your rain tyres on, you can get out there and admire the thick mist, the darkened scenery and amazing water spray effects! With the weather like this it's dangerous to get too close to a car in front, as the spray from the tyres reduces visibility almost to zero! Apparently, the chances of there being bad weather in the game are exactly the same as for that part of the world in real life! Crikey, these game designers think of everything! There are two main ways to play Formula 1 Arcade and Grand Prix. The Arcade mode plays just like Virtua Racing with time checkpoints (Murray shouts \"Time Extended!\" when you pass through them!), jazzy onscreen displays, and relatively simple car handling to make the game faster and more fun. The Grand Prix mode is a little more serious the rules are the same as a proper GP with more difficult car handling and more accurate speeds, but not so realistic as, say, Grand Prix 2 on the PC, to keep the game's arcadey feel.

Instead, everything is done in real-time choose what you want your mechanics to do, and select how much fuel to have put in, then pull away when the sign changes to green.

Both players can either compete in a full Grand Prix, racing against loads of computer-controlled drivers, or take one another on head-to-head.

Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages the in-car views are more realistic and exciting, but harder to see ahead than the high up views.

It's possible to configure the view for your TV, although we recommend sticking to the Normal mode, as the others are a little bit pointless unless you've got a massive TV. FORMULA 1 Formula 1 is a game I've been looking for ward to, as it was one of my reasons for paying  for a PlayStation. I'm a big fan of both driving games and real Formula 1 racing, so this is an ideal combination for me. The graphics are particular ly brilliant the realistic cars, scenery and textures look great and 25fps is a perfect, ly adequate frame rate. Also, the music's excellent, the sound effects are flawless, and Murray Walker's really good too. As a fan of the sport, I can pick out a few annoying things about it the Grand Prix mode isn't as detailed as I'd have liked (the car setup options are Downforce High, Medium or Low; and Fuel 0-100%); and there's no indicator to say how much fuel you have left, making timing pit stops difficult. Of course, these things won't matter a flying fig to most people.

Only the Saturn is capable of handling sprite mayhem on this kind of scale: high-resolution; ten-players at once, with the whole screen a mess of explosions and crazy collectibles. It's an easy enough mistake: assuming Bomberman has had his day. In my opinion, it's never too late to catch up with what you've been missing some of the best multi-player action ever invented! Before going in depth on that, let's briefly look at the one player game. Each successive screen is busy with detailed sprites albeit demonstrating limited animation most of which are hazardous to BM. There is some cool interaction with the scenery, triggering cannons, and switches with exploding bombs, which reaches its peak with the presence of 'Tailor' the cute colourful dinosaur whose shade dictates what kind of special ability it has. With Tailor, Bomberman can charge really fast from one side of the screen to the other: chip bombs over the wall, or stun enemies with a scream. So here's where I tell you that the multi-player mode is more fun: Get a few friends together and load this game up. See how long it takes before everyone is on the edge of their seat screaming at the telly, this is so excellent. Even if you're knocked out early on, there's still opportunity for a laugh by dropping bombs into the area from the sides. Nobody gets left out. I suppose the line Hudson Soft are taking with this one is \"if it isn't broke, let's jazz it up some more\".

AND the packaged copy is shipped with a 15 minute demo of Final Fantasy VII? It doesn't. Simply that. While the Tournament (arcade) option is easily beaten in one-player mode, the two-player versus alternative is dazzling. Thankfully Game developers Dream Factory didn't lower themselves to creating a better looking Tekken or Virtua Fighter. Instead they devised a brilliant new combat system which requires a lot of practice to work the best out of. Certainly for an original game that hasn't been playtested in the arcades, Tobal No.1 is a great achievement. The Coming Soon feature (Pages 18-21) tells you just how innovative the control is. When two players get together to seriously examine the gameplay, it's discovered that there are countless permutations on the three basic attacks, jump, and guard configuration. Like VF2 the excitement comes from the suspense between techniques, as much as it does from combo exchanges. Like Tekken 2, there are big thrills awaiting anyone dexterous enough to reel off extended sequences on the buttons alone. There are even break moves, though we're not sure how we got them just yet. Quest mode is a little strange. Almost as though Dream Factory didn't quite finish the design. What's here is interesting good control, modified from the Tournament mode, and a worthwhile challenge. However it wouldn't stand up as a game in its own right. Overall, Square's venture into 3D fighting territory is a great success.

The difference was that, rather having a great eighties name like Crockett or Tubbs, in Chase HQ you got to be Raymond or Tony. In SCI, Ray and Tone armed themselves up with heavy artillery, making the job a whole lot easier. So is it still any good? No. This is a retro pack too far. The games were never really classic (in the way that OutRun was and still is) and the audio-visuals are positively neolithic by today's standards. With infinite credits, the challenge is negligible.

"computer Video games Nichtse immmS ... NiGHTS has been criticised in certain quarters for being 'too easy' or 'too short', clearly by people who've misunderstood the game. NiGHTS isn't about endings or grades, its about scoring points, and lots of them! SCORE ATTACK! If you're lucky enough to own NIGHTS you already know it's an amazing game. Amazing, and seemingly very easy. In fact most of you will probably have completed it in a few days. However NIGHTS was not designed as a linear experience. Your aim is not simply to complete the game, or even to achieve an A grade for every course. Your aim is to score points, big time! And this guide is all about how to do just that! Reckon you're up to it? Read on... If you're aiming to break records on NIGHTS, follow the three steps detailed below. However, If you want to develop a particular dream's A-Life, you should take some time out to wander around as the children to hatch eggs and pacify scared Pians. As NIGHTS you can also make mutant Pians, which can develop into Super Pians! 1. FREE THE IDEYA NiGHTS 5230 30 BONUSTINE START SPOUS. 10000 09 ODDI ODDDD You're primary goal as soon as you O521002 44 start a course is to free the Ideya from the floating balloon claw as quickly as 10092 possible. Your points are doubled during the 'Bonus Time' (once the Ideya has been freed) so collect 20 blue chips and head directly for the claw. Do NOT stop to pass through hoops, collect stars, or use the acrobat hoop as you receive a sizeable score bonus directly related to the amount of time it takes you to free the ideya. At this stage in the game the chip cages (containing 8 chips) come in handy, as they enable you to free the course's Ideya quicker. On most courses you should be able to burst the claw on the FIRST round, though on a few this is impossible. When you become good you should be aiming for a bonus of 10,000+ on most courses. 2. BONUS TIME Despite the name, Bonus Time is where you make up the majority of your score. Once the Ideya is in your possession your only objective is to shoot around the course as many times as possible, scoring as many points as possible. This is achieved in a number of ways, all detailed below. Obviously, you'll have to avoid the temple each time you pass it, or else you'll move onto to the next course prema turely! If you can't seem to score above a 'C' its worth bearing in mind that your grade is directly related your score. 99 74101-94010 el 129901 700942 PLAYERS GUIDE A link can be started and sustained by doing literally anything passing through a hoop, collecting a chip, collecting a star, even killing a Nightmarian. You get about one second to perform the next action in the link before it resets, registered on screen by the size of the link number fading away. Your first ten links are worth the equivalent amount of points x10 (eg. the seventh action in a link is worth 70 points), and when you hit 10+ links the score peaks at 100. Some courses allow you to achieve a continuous link ie. perform a number of laps while keeping the link going (which is how you score a 100+ link), while others require you to take breaks. The exact nature of a link on each stage is up to you! Learn the course and the location of all the items, then plan your path through them for the maximum link! 108 CHIPS 99 4372 117 Collecting gold chips not only contributes towards your links but is also one of the primary methods of scoring for a course. When you return your Ideya to the temple at the end of a course (preferably when your timer is on 1) the CPU adds to your score the number of chips you have collected multiplied by 50. Therefore, 99 chips (the maximum you can collect) would be 4950 an instant A grade! CHIPS BONUS 99 4950 84 "


"3. DA BOSSES! computer video games Result 5 th night O pts X 1.9 So you thought the bosses where a bit easy eh? Ha! Beating them isn't the object. You've got to defeat them QUICKLY! You see, your performance on the boss makes or breaks your overall score. Depending on how quickly you defeat the boss (and it varies from boss to boss) your score is then multiplied in accordance with your performance anything from x2.0 (effectively doubling your score!) to X1.1 (nothing at all!). Once you've completed the game, there's an option to select which boss to face. This allows you to pick one that you're good at defeating quickly (we recommend Gulpo or Reala). However true NIGHTS masters always play with bosses set to RANDOM ON for a worthy high score. SECA SATURN Defeat the bossess quickly! Some, like Puffy here, are slower than others. 1 If you want a X2.0 multiplier you can't afford to make a single mistake! 83 102 23370 83 101 23370 87 93 236 Chips and stars are often placed in circular clusters. This allows NIGHTS to keep the link going by collecting the items on the outside of the cluster as he paraloops the inside ones to help sustain the link over empty gaps. Clever eh? CONTROLLING NIGHTS 25 18090 100 While we can tell you what you need to do in order to achieve a decent score, we can't do it for you. You're going to have to master the aerobatic abilities of the mischevious NIGHTS yourself. Of course, we can still offer you a few pointers. Firstly, you can strategically hit the drill dash button to give NIGHTS a burst of speed. This is essential for a) keeping up links and b) insuring you cross your own tail for large paraloops. Unfortunately, you don't have as much steering leverage while the button is pressed, but that's the price you pay for speed. Secondly, mastering NiGHTS' paraloop is essential for links. When NIGHTS performs a paraloop, he automatically sucks in all of the items contained within the void of his loop (even if they are in the foreground or background), and this can be used to help sustain links whenever the gap between one item and the next is too large to cross normally. When you approach a cluster of chips or stars, if you loop the lot and dash away (thus leaving the chips or stars inside the paraloop void you have created) they are dragged after you, meaning NIGHTS will collect them steadily as he crosses an open space, allowing him to keep the link going even when there are no items to collect. NIGHTS STUNT RIBBON One of the most dramatic ways of scoring points is the acrobat hoop. When passed through, NIGHTS gains a thick yellow ribbon tail, which allows him to perform stunts for which he is awarded points. There are 35 stunts in total that NIGHTS can perform with the ribbon, and for each stunt NIGHTS manages you are awarded 100 points. However, if you can pull off 12 or more stunts you get a 'Superb!!!' scoring 2000 points! Our recommendation to you is to simply go mad on the 'L' and 'R' buttons while attempting to perform the basic ribbon functions, such as loops and figure eights. 99 44 444650 45 SUPERB TENGO 410019 16. 94511 PAU COOLPIGHT!! 1200 24 OTHER STUFF There are a number of other things NIGHTS can do to increase your score. Killing Nightmarians gives you an instant 200 points, while opening point balls (by flying through the ball and then achieving the number of links indicated on the ball) instantly awards you 1000 points. Also, on the last course of each stage (Course 4) if you have collected enough stars, a Pian will appear above NIGHTS temple, holding a board with your total number of stars collected on it. Simply fly into him to receive that number of points times 10. Only on course 4, mind you. The highest single number you can get is a 'dreamy eleven'. Use the floor and ceiling to cut stunts short, giving you more time. Backtrack on your trail as much as possible while performing stunts.

"computer video games DREAM GUIDE We haven't got enough space to go into each dream in detail (you should be able to find most of the items yourself), so here's a run down on some of the more hidden features in each dream that may come in handy when attempting to achieve a record breaking score. Where we refer to 'hidden' items, it means you have to paraloop a specific area to reveal it. SEGA SAMUR CLARIS SPRING VALLEY ELLIOT SPLASH GARDEN O 05 0:2 58 78 1 The best you can achieve on COURSE 1 is a 28 link, though its fairly easy to perform and you should be looking for a final score of 50,000+. On COURSE 2 get the balls hidden behind the first mountain, and be sure to collect the Drill Dash icon hidden above the waterfall (1) on your last round. On COURSE 3 collect the chip cage above the waterfall to free the ideya on your first round (2), and look for the Pian icon hidden just before the first Stunt Ribbon (3). Finally, there is a Loop icon to be found on COURSE (4) by paralooping the three chips above the stone bridge near the start of the course. Believe it or not you can get a continuous link on COURSE 1 by paralooping the large number of stars in between the two fountains, so you collect them as you are propelled into the background (1). Collect the Pian Icon hidden in the chips just after the first brown switch (2) on COURSE 2. On COURSE 3 be sure to hit the brown switch in the bottom left of top/down garden clock section (3), and collect the Drill Dash icon just outside the garden by looping through the orange hoops. Finally, when you enter the underwater section of COURSE 4, keep heading down to discover two chip cages (4).. 100 6 705 MYSTIC FOREST NIGHTS FROZEN BELL 100 3 28 .66 40~2 3949 30-2 You can achieve a continuous link on COURSE 1, though it isn't easy. On COURSE 2, loop the four stars directly above the first signpost for seven hidden chips (1), then loop the circle of seven stars above the floating rock field for a hidden Pian Icon (2). Head left at the start of COURSE 3 to snag the chip cage, thus making it possible to destroy the balloon claw in the first round. Use large loops inside the cave to both pump up your stunt count, and rope in enough links to open the point ball (3). On the top/down section of COURSE 4, fly through the spikey hoop in the bottom right hand corner of the maze and perform a para-loop at the dead end to reveal a Drill Dash refill icon (4). COURSE 1 is a small course where is relatively easy to keep a continuous link going. On COURSE 2 there is a Pian Icon hidden in the first set of chips on the first ladder near the 32link point ball (1). Likewise at the start of COURSE 3, a Loop Icon can be yours simply by flying through the four half hoops to the right of the temple (2). Also keep an eye out for the chip cage hidden under a rock directly beneath the balloon claw (3) and the Drill Dash icon hidden in the circle of snowballs to the right of that (4). SOFT MUSEUM 74 STICK CANYON 1108 012 PLAYERS GUIDE COURSE 1 allows you to perform one of the most extensive continuous links in the game, provided you make use of the five blue chips hidden inside the seven chip formation (1). Collect the hidden Drill Dash icon (2) to replenish your dash bar on the last round of COURSE 2, and pick up the hidden Pian Icon at the T-shaped formation of chips just before the cannon on COURSE 3. Loop the two single stars before you enter the Soft Museum in COURSE 4 for 8 chips (3), and again loop the single star by the last (lower) mirror before you exit the museum for more chips (4). There is a giant loop icon hidden in the 4 chips above the first canopy outside the museum. 1 0,11 On COURSE 1 there is a Drill Dash icon hidden in the first chip cluster you come across (1), and a Pian Icon hidden directly above the spikey hoop half way round the course (2). Snag the chip cage hidden just to the left of where the first blue anti-magnet pushes you up on COURSE 2 (3), and look for another Drill Dash icon hidden in some stars just to the left of the point ball after the electronic scales on COURSE 3. There's loads of stuff hidden on the way up the tower in COURSE 4 (4)(we've heard of a massive time extension), but you've got to get to the top with at least 50 seconds left in order to survive the two grill rides. 86 "


"computer Video games 116 114 BOSS GUIDE GILLWING SEGA SATURN While initially Gillwing seems like one of the worst (read 'slowest') bosses to face, he is in fact one of the easiest. The trick is NOT to attack him by drill dashing his body, but instead to defeat him using huge paraloops. By paralooping his entire body with a tear-shaped paraloop (including his tail) you can destroy him in one or two goes. You even get a LINK score for destroying multiple body segments at once. PUFFY WIZEMAN While it is not possible to do Puffy in as quick a time as some of the other bossess, the x2.0 multiplier does not require as fast a time. However, you still can't afford to make a mistake. You don't need to spin Puffy to get the velocity to throw her, spinning is merely a way of taking the correct aim at the breakable section of the obstacle course. And don't grab he a) by the head ,or b) after she has just rebounded from a surface, or you'll incur the dreaded 5 second penalty. GULPO The most important thing to remember when fighting Wizeman is that, although he takes a while to defeat, any time over 70 earns you a X2.0 multiplier. He attacks first with meteors which can be dodged easily by adopting a high/low pattern followed by a series of asteroid belts which must either be flown above or below. The snowballs can cause problems, so make sure you aim for the space where they aren't, while the whirlwind can be passed through with no problems simply by drill dashing through the 'eye of the storm' (centre). One other tip is to wait when you grab Wizeman's shield, for your doppelganger NIGHTS to appear, as he/she will help you smash though it in one go. Gulpo is perceived as one of the easier bosses, simply because it's so hard to get hit by him. But you do have to hit him FIVE times, and it is sometimes difficult to judge which fish will send you flying through the aquadome at the right angle. Often you will have to travel further than you think to reach the right propeller. Judging it is a skill that comes with practice. a99 NIGHTS 69 53120 35120 JACKLE 6555120 Though Jackle is viewed as one of the most difficult bosses, he is actually one of the easiest. The trick is to avoid his initial batch of tracer playing cards by flying on a high/low pattern. Once you grab him and drill dash, he looses his coat, and provided you can keep an eye on which direction he flies, you can prevent him from ever reaching his coat again, thus resulting in a good score multiplier. CLAWZ REALA Probably the slowest of all the bosses, unless you get lucky. While it isn't particularly difficult to diffuse all of the rocket mice, you will often not be able to hit Clawz until you are down to last mouse. The way to get around this is to use the mice to propel you in the opposite direction to take Clawz by surprise. Sometimes he will wait on a mouse while he sets the fuse, and at this point 69 84490 you should head for him and ignore the current lit rocketmouse. Reala is also often perceived as the easiest boss in the game, this time because you only have to loop him THREE times to vanquish him. And he is easy too. With practice you can learn to perform a paraloop just as he flies to meet you, meaning he flies right into it. And you can also injure him sometimes just by drill dashing into him.

"computer Video games ARCADE 2 LAST BRONX FIGHTING GAME BY AM3 SEPT RELEASE 1-2 PLAYER  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  DISTRIBUTED BY DEITH LEISURE  MODEL 2 ARCADE SYSTEM UPRIGHT CABINET BHX hen talking about fighting games and Sega, only one development team springs to mind AM2. Clearly fellow R&D Dept AM3 intend on changing that with their first beat 'em up, the Model 2 based Last Bronx! A plane features in the background, similar to Fighting Vipers. Survia Mode Resi  ICT NAOL 37758 POINTS 10. The l'1 RUMBLE IN THE BRONX WITH AM3'S BEAT 'EM UP! 10508 900 Survival Mode press G+P+K. Comparisons with Fighting Vipers are bound to be drawn with this game, what with it featuring an urban battle ground (Tokyo this time, no less) and nine hip streetpunk warriors. However, whereas FV only touched on the theme of weapons, Last Bronx makes them its business. Each fighter has their own martial art tool around which their whole fighting-style is based. There's a nunchaku-wielding teenager, a female Air Force trooper with twin tonfas, a baggytrousered skatepunk with a pole, a purple-suited fop with a wooden sword, A sexy blonde female armed with twin sai, a cheerleader with deadly double sticks, a biker with sanetsukon (three-piece nunchaku), and clearly for big-guy humour value a builder with a lump mallet. There's also the boss a goggle-wearing tonfa-fighter called Red Eye who's also a hidden selectable character. Using the same Guard, Punch, Kick system as Virtua Fighter, the game is simple to get to grips with if you know the formula. Obviously though punches are better described as weapon attacks. And fans of PPPK combos are going to love it. Try PPPKK or even just PPPPP combos is some cases! All the fighters have easily-chained moves. In fact, locking the moves together is more akin to Tekken, ie tap a load of buttons quickly and watch the character shuffle them off on screen. Even the throws (G+P again) are very Tekkenesque, with body locks and arm-breaking making an appearance. Spicing up the proceedings are all manner of little touches. For starters, all the weapons leave glowing tracers in their wake. Particularly impressive when the likes of a triple-Nunchaku combo or twoway Mallet swipe are performed. Connect with a move, and coloured sparks fly up. Knock a fighter flat and an impact splash rises from the ground. And for extra street cool, your total victories are registered as people 'wasted'. Buzzin' homesters! Far more enclosing than in other fighting games, the backdrops have barriers that can't be broken or overcome. They can however be climbed as in FV. There's also a number of levels with ceilings (Lust Subway and Radical Parking Lot great names!) which add a real claustrophobic feel to the combat. Others, such as Naked Airport have jets taking off, landing and circling in the distance. They're all very impressive! Strangely, none of the characters are lightsourced, even though there's differently lit environments (complete with long shadows on dusk stages). The characters still look powerfully 3D though, thanks to amazingly detailed textures, even close up. With its bizarre hybrid gameplay and flashy weaponry, Last Bronx is a fun enough fighting game. However, it doesn't offer excitement equal to, or above VF2 and Fighting Vipers. >>> LISA IN 1 POR OTHLET 1 The weapons leave a motion blur, like in Soul Edge.

"computer video games NEUL GAMES 3600 CHLIN-LI BIRDIE Four months. That's the lead time now between the hottest arcade game coining it, and a home version being launched in Japan. Four months! Here it is then. Wahoo! FORMAT: FIGHTING GAME BY: CAPCOM 1-2 PLAYER OUT NOW (JP) SATURN VERSION PLANNED  ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE STORAGE 1 CD  PUBLISHED BY CAPCOM  TEL: N/A STREET FIGHTER ZERO 2 ON PLAYSTATION VG was the first magazine to bring you pics and insider info on arcade Street Fighter Alpha 2. A month later we were the first to reveal tactics for all fighters. We love this game! The question we most want answered is just how good the home versions are. Well, we have the PlayStation version right here, with Saturn SFA2 due to arrive in time for next issue. Can't wait! Comparisons we'll have to leave until then, meanwhile here's most of what we know on Capcom's Sony efforts. Recognise this character? He's Rolento, who appeared as one of the bosses in Final Fight (arcade and Mega-CD). He's brought his trademark grenades with him, though his main weapon is the Baton. Our favourite new character. ENTO BIRDIE NUMBER TWO ALREADY? In case vou just returned from a four-month trip to outer Mongolia, here is a rundown of all-new features SFA2 brings. ORIGINAL CUSTOM COMBO Soon as a fighter's Super Combo Level Gauge reaches at least stage one, they may attempt a Custom Combo. This is initiated by pressing any two punch buttons plus one kick button simultaneously. A purple shadow appears behind the fighter, indicating that they may now execute as many standard or special moves as possible within a time limit. The length of time is governed by the gauge. Anything even a stream of pose moves is possible. Charge moves simply require the directions to command, minus the charge time. IDEAL HOME EXHIBITION ROSE 8  SA) PED Much of the excitement surrounding the original SFA conversion centred around the custom options. Well Capcom have bettered the situation somewhat for the sequel. There are now eight Turbo Speed settings, where NORMAL MODE five is equal to the arcade. The RECORDING MODE excellent Training Mode now CHARACTER CHANGE enables players to set the ACTION ST 19 Super Combo Level Gauge at SPEED WOMAL TEST each of the three levels. In Versus Mode a deliberately . basic character select screen means that loading time is sig. nificantly reduced. Fans of the original/ remix music option aren't so lucky though. What we get is the arcade music only which consists of remixed Alpha originals anyway. TINE Ken can only produce multiple fireballs when he's in the throes of a custom combo! "


"computer video games VETERAN WORLD WARRIORS RETURN CUSTOM BACKGROUNDS FOR ALL CHARACTER Say 'yoga' to Dhalsim, and 'HAH' to Zangief, cause they're back! They are largely unchanged from Super SF2 Turbo, though they boast all-new Super Combos. The animation and new art give both an awesome presence. But the oldest Street Fighter vet, and one who many may not recognise, is Gen the Chinese grand master from the very first Street Fighter. The most important aspect to learn about Gen's technique is that he switches between two fighting styles Mantis, and Crane. One disappointing element of Street Fighter Alpha is that there are only six backgrounds, which are shared by more than one fighter. Only difference being incidental characters such as the crowd in Ken/ Charlie's stage. In Alpha 2 each fighter has his/her own personalised location, plus two more which relate to Charlie and Sagat's last battles. The detail and scale of animation, yes even in the backgrounds, is staggering. ADON BIRDIE 1 CHUN-LI DAN DHALSIM GEN SODOM GUY   A NEW WORLD WARRIOR STREET FIGHTER ZERO 2 ON PLAYSTATION CHARLIE (NASH) ROLENTO ROSE Sakura. What a cutie! Ryu is her idol which means she trains to fight just like him. She's modified her techniques, however. For example her Dragon Punch is preceded by a run up, and three styles of Fireball. Her Hurricane Kick doesn't float along in the same way as her hearthrob's either. RYU SAGAT SAKURA AKUMA (GOUKI) BISON (VEGA) 1 ZANGIEF * NECESSARY CUTS AUSTRALIA VENEZUELA RINGS AROUND While Capcom have made every effort to reproduce the arcade game and then some there have been some sacrifices this time around. Mostly graphical. First of all the character animation has been reduced though this is very slight, and only apparent on Zangief. There are no reflections in the puddles of Gen's alley, and the background cha ras in Ken's stage are mostly statues (in the arcade Strider and his buddies are animated). When competing as Ryu on Guy's stage, where Sakura makes a 'surprise' appearance, there is no hijack scene the stage begins straightaway with Sakura squaring off against her idol. A less than crucial alteration is the arcade intro, which is displayed as FMV footage. SATURN? Which of the 32-bit systems boasts the most faithful SFA2 conversion we can tell you in four weeks. During this time we shall be doing an Arcade PlayStation-Saturn features check, so that you know what November is holding for UK fans. 91 "

You can, however, play eight-player Street Racer sometime soon. PlayStation Pos 3/8 couple of years back, developers Vivid Image surprised even Nintendo by producing a four-player Mario Kart imitation. On a system noted for slow down, simultaneous four-player racing, which includes full-on fighting action between characters, is certainly worth attention. STREET RACER BO9002 EG4/14 Fros Now this expertise has been applied to 32-bit adaptations, for which separate teams have been working to highlight the individual strengths of both Saturn and PlayStation. There's also a PC CD-ROM version soon to follow. And Game Boy! CVG recently saw both Saturn and PlayStation versions in action. Pos S Pos / OCTO STREET RACER MAXIMUM CONTROL DRIVE YOUR FUNKY STREET RACER The main thing Vivid Image are shouting about is that SS and PS Street Racer boasts eight-player simultaneous action. Why? Well because they can. We're not sure most people are willing to invest in six extra joypads and two multi-taps for the pleasure especially since, by VI's own admission, detail and gameplay suffer slightly in four player mode.

During a race there are Virtua Racing/ Daytona USA style view modes, ranging from distant to just behind the car. If you feel that eight-player action in split screen is too much for your eyes to handle, there's Micro Mode (guess where this idea came from) which places all cars on one high resolution screen at once. And even this is viewable from isometric or plan perspective. Players who are skilled enough to master three racing classes, are rewarded by a fourth special one. After that... well, we don't want to ruin everything at this stage. SPEED FREAK ! 0077420 The window can be split like this in boxes or horizontally. Your choice.

We noted a few things which are unique to Saturn or PlayStation, that you might find interesting. For example on PlayStation the car becomes transparent when viewed in chase VR mode, whereas on Saturn the car remains solid. However the Saturn courses are more detailed in terms of surrounding architecture, plus overhead clouds cast moving shadows on the ground. While PlayStation boasts smoother textures in most places, Saturn answers back with pretty gob smacking TRANSPARENT water effects. Both versions run at a super smooth 60-frames-per-second.

In the time since, Capcom have made a some changes to it. Nonetheless, we've managed to get hands-on experience of the current version. Just to recap, the fighters in Star Gladiator are a bizarre range of alien and mechanical warriors ranging from a giant stomping dreadnought robot, to a Mars Attacks-style alien called Saturn. There's even a velociraptor-style fighter. The game looks stunning. The amount of detail on the fighters, both in polygon-count and texturing is quite staggering. And their movement is incredibly fluid, although quite slow. But with Capcom still working on the play mechanics, it's impossible to judge how this will eventually turn out. Of most interest is the new control system. Four buttons vertical attack, horizontal attack, kick and guard provide a wide range of moves when combined with all manner of joystick commands (fireball motion, up down up down etc). Each fighter has around 20 special moves to their name. Plus, Capcom have included what they call the 'Plasma Combo' system. These are similar to chain combos, with strings of button presses yielding fast-linking moves. However, a look at one of Capcom's flowcharts of a sinWODA re Satuz 23 PEONI P ATHTHODNI (4B 5409 PLASM.

Nope, this game is about the Pepperami mascot (who is a Pepperami). However as we found to our surprise when we saw the game this isn't the usual knockedout product license, but looks to be a well-crafted adventure game. Using some brilliant rendered characters and backdrops, visually it captures the quality-animation feel of the ads. And it's got the sense of humour too. There's Yoghurt 'Potstitutes' (chortle) and Disco Biscuits dancing at clubs (ahahahaha). One particularly amusing scene sees Pepperami going to loo only to find he doesn't have a winkle (thank God). If it's as fun as it seems, Animal could be a hit! FORMAT: ARCADE BY: AM1 STYLE: SCROLLING BEAT 'EM UP DUE: NOW The name of this game can be slightly misleading it's got no link with the Die Hard films, and it looks and plays far more like a Streets of Rage game. The sideways-scrolling fighting is slightly more in-depth than the Streets of Rage games so far, as the moves and combos are more like Virtua Fighter 2 than anything else. There are also loads of weapons and items to be picked up, and they can work together to create new weapons for example, a spray can will stun enemies, but when combined with the lighter found on the level before, it makes a deadly flamethrower! There are also sections between levels which require fast reactions to take out enemies before they get the chance to tackle you. The two player mode is also great, as the fighters can work together with lots of combined special moves and PPPK-style combos. As this is made on the Saturn hardware ST-V arcade board, the Saturn version will be exactly the same (available just after Christmas). Ever wanted to see a stick of spicey meat drive a car?

Such is his all-encompassing sight, that were he to open his singular eye for but a split-second, his omnipotent brain would shrivel like a sultana! So he remains still, never stirred by the events of the Multiverse. The dawn of new civilisations, the birth and death of suns and planets. Nothing flinches the Scrutinizor. Nothing, except... Suddenly, two streaking comets flash past. Perhaps they are humanoid-shaped, but move too fast to be sure. The Scrutinizor ponders this happening, but his attention is soon drawn away. Deep within his cosmic frame something shifts. A movement from a region immobile for aeons. His bowel! How could he have been unaware of this event? Bubbles rise through the godlike entity's lower tract and gripped by fear he clenches! His roving eye snaps open, only for a blink, but it is enough. Escaping gas ignites and the force of a trillion supernovas rips through the heavens. In a thousand years, the shockwaves will reach Earth... NOWI BURSTING ONTO THESE PAGES FOR THE FIRST TIME. BUBBLE BABES 10.P. 1.4!!! THE GASSY GIRLS FROM A FAR-FLUNG GALAXYI! emember you read it here first! Intelligent alien life has been encountered! Not on the Moon or Mars, but in a parallel dimension inbetween our very own! No mere speculation is this. For we here at the CVG Skyscraper, have been visited by ambassadors from the otherworldy capital of Bubblopolis. They are OxyGeena and HydroJenny, collectively known as the Bubble Babes! And their objective here is a simple one to recarbonate our lives! Having already proven their powers by scribbling mathematical formulas for previously unknown fizzion technology onto our blackboard, they have since gone into detail about their masterplan. Unfortunately we didn't hear anything they said, because their pressurised Bubble Aura caused our ears to pop. And our milk to bubble. And our hair to frizz. Even as we write this, our saliva is frothing and we're breathing snot-bubbles out of our nostrils. Their bubble powers truly are extraordinary! But enough of this bubble burble, tis time the fizzy females spake! Four thousand years ago, we were queens of Egypt. The greatest ruling scientists on all Earth. We invented the Jacuzzi. Our advanced activities drew attention from beyond our planet and, by means of a cosmic straw, we were sucked into a quadrant known as the Rainbow Islands, where two alien professors known as Bub and Bob showed us how to control our Bubble Auras and taught us the untapped science of Fizziks. Now we wish to share our secrets with you Earthloids. We travelled to your planet in the 19th Century and gave you carbonated soft drinks, but it seems you require even more fizz. So we've popped back! THEIR MASTERPLAN FEATURE We have seen the future. A carbo-nation of fizzy-blooded humans, who travel by bubble-car and communicate by think bubbles. A sparkling paradise powered by the limitless energy of Fizziks. However, first we must develop your Bubble Auras. Fear not, the process is frothy fun. We have created two bubble-building packs Bust-A-Move 2 and Bubble Bobble. Continuous exposure to these games will ensure your brain is correctly carbonated. Soon your minds will be bubbling over! BUBBLING OVER! Clearly these girls mean fizzness. Expect more fizitations from them soon both in CVG and on the street. In the meantime, keep your eye bubbles peeled for Bust-A-Move 2-out now for Saturn and PlayStation and Bubble Bobble coming soon. 98 "

Sony have also developed a visor-style headset for their machine. Takara brought out a similar one compatible with all games for all systems a few months back.

Start PPPK combo TO DO AKIRA'S TECHNIQUE TECHNIQUE METHOD PP METHOD PP Two high punches Two high punches High punch, high kick High punch, high kick One of the best things in the VF games is being able to \"buffer\" certain moves. This means that while one move is being done on-screen, another is being performed so that it comes out faster than usual. It takes practice and must be done very quickly. The best of these buffered moves is Akira's Stun Palm of Doom. To do it, get close to your opponent and press G+P+K, then B, DF+P+K, then B+P. Do this sequence as fast as humanly possible to perform an awesome three-hit combo!

For example, a standing kick which knocks someone over can be linked with a standing punch or even a kickflip something completely impossible in VF 2. Also, as the knee attack (usually F+K) knocks people in the air for longer than before, it's a lot easier to use it to start floating combos. There's not a lot of advice we can offer other than to experiment, as there are too many combination possibilities to list here.

Or send your problems to us. Please don't send SAEs because we can't reply personally, I'M STUCK! CVG, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London, EC1R 3AU. To collect Alex, you need to play the game as normal, but when you reach the third character, beat them with a \"Great!\" victory, meaning that you only have a tiny amount of energy when you win the final round. You'll then fight Roger or Alex, and you have to beat them, then complete the game to have them added to your memory card. 18 FADE TO BLACK To access the hidden wire-frame view, make sure you've got every one of the characters, then select one player arcade mode while holding the L1 and L2 buttons. The controls remain the same as with side-on view. Matthew Blundell from Barton upon Humber in N. Lincolnshire wants to tell everyone about the cheat that he and his friend Khan Doyme found. \"On the penultimate level, Level 12, you meet the supermorph for the final time in the room before your ship. Usually the supermorph changes into its original form after talking to you and kills Sarah. If, on entering the room, you shoot at the morph in its human state, it will ignore Sarah and instead charge at you, running into the mines on the way. You should now proceed as normal, avoiding the morph while running to your ship. If you make it with Sarah still alive, you will see the video of the dying supermorph while Sarah pilots the ship. You will also not have to do the final level to see the end of game footage.\" Ta Matt. Dear CVG. I can do all the moves for Street Fighter Alpha on the PlayStation except Akuma's Firecracker. All the other mags give the same way of doing it: F, F, Jab, Jab, F (something like that) BUT IT DOES NOT WORK!! Me and my friend have been trying for 1 year so please could you help us? And also several American mags have said that it is possible to get Wolverine from XMen on SF Alpha. HOW? And finally, on Ridge Racer Revolution we find it impossible to win time trials against the black car. Is there a way to defeat it? Thankyou! Paul/Tugume, Milton Keynes. To make your character's head and limbs slightly bigger than they should be, simply hold the Select button when choosing a character or in between fights. Once it's been done, do it again to increase the size once more, making you look like a real mutant! Another small tip is that you can play in Kazuya's purple outfit he wears when you fight him at the end of the game. First, collect every character, then select Kazuya by pressing the Start button when highlighting him. VIEWPOINT CVG: To do Akuma's Firecracker (also known as the Instant Hellish Death Strike), press Light Punch, Light Punch, Forward, Light Kick, Hard Punch as fast as you can. With a bit of practice you'll be able to do it fast enough. It's NOT possible to play as Wolverine in SF Alpha. The other magazines were lying. And the only tip we can offer for beating the black car in RRR is to be driving in a good car yourself, and to watch your rear-view mirror for him. Whenever he gets close, cut right in front of him, forcing him to hit you. Make him do this a few times and you should win. First of all, you're going to need the key we use to refer to PlayStation buttons: Circle Cross Square Triangle PC CD-ROM WORMS: REINFORCEMENTS Tips To make yourself invincible, pause the game and press S, S, C, C, T, X, S, Up, Up, Down, Down, L1, R1, Select. Now you can't be harmed at all. Dear C&VG, Please, please help me on Duke Nukem 3D. I can't get anywhere in the game. Have you any cheats or tips for Duke Nukem 3D. From Chris Sarjant, Northants. To skip to the next level, pause the game and press S, C, T, Right, Left, Down, R1, L2, R2, R1. These landscape codes from Richard Dunkley and Jamie Henshall give you some of the best levels for Worming. Just enter them on the Generate Landscape screen. ICE, JUNGLE, HELL, WORMS, OCEAN, TEAM17. If you'd rather avoid using button-press cheats and instead skip to a level using codes, try these. CVG: To cheat and give yourself every weapon, item and piece of ammo, type DNSTUFF during the game. If you're REALLY having problems getting anywhere, type DNCORNHOLIO during the game to put God mode on. But we recommend that you don't keep it on all the time or you'll ruin the whole game for yourself. 1-4 COMMAND AND CONQUER: THE COVERT OPERATIONS CGG CLL CRR FGD FUU ERNES ASSO Thanks to Brett Collins from Saltburn-by-the-sea for his tips for C&C. First of all, to play with the excellent dinosaur cheat, go to the C&C directory in DOS and type \"C&C FUNPARK\". FRN HGD HLG HRL KGG KLD KRJ MGJ MLD MRG PGL PLG PRD To make some easy money, get a vehicle and put it on the repair bay. Now try and sell the repair bay it sells the vehicle instead. This money doesn't quite exist properly, however, and even if all your silos and tiberium refinery get destroyed, you still have the money. And if you build a tiberium refinery, let the harvester go off, sell the refinery, build another, let that harvester go off, then sell the refinery in an eternal loop, you'll actually make money! Dear Ed Lomas, After buying the July edition of Computer and Video Games, I read the review that you and other of your colleagues wrote on International Track and Field for the PlayStation. The review tempted be to buy the game, that of what I did. After having the game for almost a month now, the only problem I am having is with the Triple Jump. I can get 20 metres on the odd occasion but can never see it within the realms of human possibility to get near the world record you set of 26.37 metres. I am not saying I doubt your achievement, but can you please tell me how it's done! Neil Millen, Bath. FREEPLAY 6-2 6-3 TEKKEN 2 And Brett, if you really want to take us on at Quake, hang about on any European Quake servers and look out for one of us joining in our Quake names are in the last issue). Tekken 2's going to be released officially very soon, and we thought you should be prepared with some information on how to collect all of the characters on your memory card. ED: I don't mean to disappoint you, but I've never got near 26.37 metres either. My actual record was 20.37 metres and Tom Guise just wrote it down on a bit of paper badly so that his 'O' looked more like a '6 than it should. When he typed it up he got it wrong as well. The moral of the story? Pay attention at school so that you can write properly when you're grown up. To get the 10 bosses, simply complete the game with each of the 10 regular characters. !?! \\?! \\?!!?!!?!!?! 11 "

"computer video James QUAKE GIBLETSY uake is one of the greatest games of all time. We know that, you know that, and if you don't know that, look at the review on page 58 to find out that it is. One of the reasons for it being so amazing is that it can be customised so easily, and we're here to tell you about some of the best new things you can pick up for Quake on the internet. Of course, this isn't anywhere near everything available, as there are loads of things appearing every day. But here are a few choice patches, and a short description of what they do. You can use the patches in deathmatches! WHERE DO I GET 'EM FROM THEN? We recommend you take a look on The Quake Stomping Grounds at http:\\\\www.stomped.com for the latest patches, as their File Area is one of the best around. Or you could try ftp.cdrom.com\\pub\\quake, as there are hundreds of Quake related files here. PLAUNCH.ZIP Makes the grenade launcher fire men out, who explode in a shower of guts. Makes the rocket launcher fire slowly, firing lightning from each rocket in what ever direction you face. SKINS.ZIP Gives you loads of new textures, including a Stormtrooper, the Predator, Terminator, and others. You can then switch between them at any time. CG G GGG ever direction you DUH, WHAT NOW, BOSS? Once you've got a patch, create a subdirectory in your Quake directory with whatever name you want to remember the patch by (ie. call the blaster directory BLASTER, and the grappling hook directory GRAPPLE) and unzip all the files into this directory. Now, to play Quake with this patch activated, add \"-game xxxx\", replacing the xxxx with the name of the directory. therefore, to use the grappling hook, type \"QUAKE -GAME GRAPPLE\". Easy. OBSERVE.ZIP This lets you join in a deathmatch game, then go invisible (other than a pair of eyes), then float around the level, even through walls! You can't attack or be hurt, meaning you're just like a floating camera! HOMING.ZIP Makes the rockets home in on enemies, moving round corners at right-angles as well. Also adds even more gore. DECOY.ZIP Lets you leave a hologram of yourself with a camera mounted inside. Watch from a safe distance, then explode it when someone gets close! STEAMING HEAPS OF QUAKE GIBLETS WEAPON PATCHES These patches will edit your weapons, giving you new toys to play with or making you even tougher than before. PROXMIN1.ZIP The rockets now stick to the wall, ceiling or floor, and stay there until someone gets close. Then they : explode! FIEND11.ZIP Makes the Pentagram of Power morph you into a Fiend! You can then run around the levels murdering people for a few minutes! BLASTER.ZIP Replaces the super nail gun with the Enforcer's blaster gun. SKARMOD3.ZIP Gives you loads of things at once! A new laser gun, 48 textures (including Mario), the Fiend power-up, new sounds, solid bodies, and lots, lots more! EJECT.ZIP Makes empty shotgun shells fly out the back of the shotgun. They look great and sit on the floor for ages. FREAK11.ZIP Monster magic weapons. The axe fires Death Knight magic, the shotgun fires the Enforcer Blaster, and the nail gun fires Scrag magic. GIBGUN.ZIP Makes the grenade launcher fire heads and other body parts. There are plenty more exciting add-ons available for Quake (the patch that lets a dead player move their head around, biting other people's ankles is cool!) so get looking! magic. AXE_OF_C.ZIP The Axe of Command, which turns enemies onto your side! THROWAXE.ZIP Lets you throw your axe. When thrown, it falls on the floor and must be collected before it can be thrown again. KNEE PATCHES If you fall over and make a hole in your jeans, get someone with sowing know-how to sow a patch over your hole. This makes your jeans more respectable and reduces drafts, as well as increasing their lifespan. Oh, we're funny. MISCELLANEOUS PATCHES These do things other than modify your weapons, like turning you into monsters or giving you extra options. FREEPLAY THE END Don't forget, FreePlay is YOUR magazine! If : you've got anything to say about Quake, send it in as we'll keep Quake Giblets going as long the game's popular! Just write to the address on the back page of FreePlay, marking your envelopes \"Quake Giblets\" or E-Mail our biggest Quake fan, Ed, on: elomas@candyg.demon.co.uk GRAP109B.ZIP A newer version of the grappling hook mentioned in the review. It's got its own graphics (all light-sourced) and it's now possible to hang from the ceiling while shooting with another weapon! MORPH.ZIP Probably the best of the lot! This lets you morph into any monster at any time! This is great fun in deathmatch, as you can have loads of Shamblers vs. loads of Scrags! Get this now! QUAKE GOOG OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SOLID.ZIP Makes dead bodies stay solid, so that you can keep hitting them until they explode! Also makes the dogs fight on your side, killing enemies and chewing their : bodies up! 14 "
