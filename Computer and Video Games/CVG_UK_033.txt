One final challenge. Do well at Decathlon on a Suncom Joy-sensor!!! J. Yeates, St Clement, Jersey Editor's reply: Arcade tips will appear from time to time on the Arcade Action pages and we reckon Professor Video will keep games players supplied with useful tips on computer games. DOWN ON THE UPSTART Dear Sir, With regard to A. Myers' letter in the May issue of Computer & Video Games, I would like to stick up for Keith Campbell's views on Richard Shepherd's Urban Upstart. I have played this game longer than Keith Campbell has-but I still agree with most of the things he said. OK it's an original adventure and not your typical dragons and wizards cliché. However, the graphics and descriptions hardly stimulate the imagination. In fact, the graphics could and should have been dispensed with to leave room for more rooms or better vocabulary. Paul Stollard, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. PLAYING OUR TUNE! I would like to comment on a couple of points. Dungeons and Dragons is no longer the most successful game, having been outvoted by Runequest, which in my mind is far more logical and realistic. Secondly, it is mentioned in the article that the Dungeon Master creates a multi-level dungeon, featuring monsters, etc. What this description details is a form of play that has not been played on a wide scale for many years. I would like to follow up by mentioning that a number of postal games are run on an amateur basis which, unlike games such as Starlord, etc, don't cost  per turn but just the return postage and a moderate initial fee to cover any photo-copying needed. Most such games are run in non-profit making magazines, produced by one or two guys as a hobby. Such games include Diplomacy, Snits Revenge and En Garde!—there is even a game called Finchley Station which uses a London Underground map as a board! This leads me to say that if anyone is interested in postal or role-playing games, my own magazine Vacuous Grimoire sells for a mere 50p including p&p and contains a number of openings for postal games. If people include a SAE, I'll also give them a rundown on role-playing games, including what they need to get started in this great hobby. Richard Roberts, Eastleigh, Hants. have one also. It is possible he has damaged the lead. As for the software, shop assistants should tell you that about 10 per cent of 3rd party Atari software won't work, not as you say, most. All Atari software will work on the XL. As he has a 400, I am sure he must have heard of PAGE 6 (the magazine). Even if not, in there is a special XL column which informs interested parties that a translator is available for the XL that boots the 4/800 operating system which will allow virtually any program to run on the new range (with the exception of Soccer, Bandits and AE). I would also like to mention that in your review column you do not say whether the games have a version for other micros. For example, O'Reily's Savage Pond and Forbidden Forest are all available on other micros. It would also be useful if you would state which games run on the 600XL. M. Dawson, Corby, Northants. TIPS FOR THE ATARI Dear Mr Editing-type person, hello there! The idea of having music while you play is good, despite comments from P. Knee suggesting otherwise. The PiMan's Greatest Hits, available from Automata-Wow! a saxophone, is this a clue?for the price of , really helps me on Pengo from Watford. Please can you put Pengo in the Hall of Fame, because it is really good. The Arcade Action pages have been missing their tips for quite a while now. Please start printing tips again. Also, why not have a similar thing in the Games News pages? Bug Hunter and Program Extra are all very well for short tips, but tips on the whole thing need to have their space as well. Activision's Decathlona certain arcade company may start throwing fireballs and such-like around, because Decathlon is very close to the arcade Track and Field, and it's got more events!!! The Slik Stik could be good FLIGHTS OF FANTASY Dear Sir, I have a tip for Atari owners. The POKE 54018,52 routine allows the user to listen to pre-recorded music cassettes or to access tape heads for cleaning. This can be taken one step further. If the routine is typed in and the PLAY and RECORD buttons are held down, this will clear old programs to make room for new recordings. This will give us more money to save up for our expensive software rather than having to fork out on new cassettes!!!! Richard Cottle, Bristol, Avon. MAKING GOOD CONNECTIONS Dear Sir, I read with interest the article concerning fantasy role playing games in your Book of Adventure supplement, as I have been playing such games now for a few years. Dear Sir In reply to Stuart Simpson's letter in the May 1984 issue, may I say that the old 410 recorder is quite easy to I connect to the 600 XL as I "

"UNFAIR PLAY Dear Sir I am writing to say that I totally agree with the comment by Alan Pashby in your May issue. What sickens me about Atari games is that they produce a range of their most popular games for the CBM 64, Spectrum, BBC, Electron, etc, and sell them for a cheaper price than Atari owners have to pay for the original Atari games.

"PETITION COMPETITION C MAKE A NAME FOR YOURSELF! THE WRITING ON THE WALL How many times have you been tempted to get out that little aerosol can and have a good squirt at an inviting blank wall? Trevor Truran's latest brain teaser was designed to rid the streets of graffiti writers and to that end, he devised a puzzle guaranteed to keep even the most ardent graffitier at home, with a chance to win one of five Centipede Board Games from Milton Bradley The winning spots for the crosses were G3, 65 and G6 giving 147/6 which equals 24.5. The six lucky winners are Martin Marchant from Staffs: Paul Hill, Tyne and Wear; Nina Pickup, N. Yorkshire; P. Grownow, Essex and Carl Nickolas from Cambs. Well doneCentipede is on its way THE MISSING LINK What's the common link between Pitfall Harry, Tarzan and Dr Livingstone? \"They still can't eat three shredded wheat!!\" Well done to W. M. Chua from London who is one of the six winners in our Pitfall Harry competition. Our friends at Activision gave us six Atari VCS and three games cartridges for the six people who came up with the right number of hidden animals and the most original link between the three world famous explorers We especially liked Antony Tankard's offering of \"They're all pit-swingin', lakeleggin' bog-beatin', treasure-seekin' snake-charmin', jungle-searchin', crocsteppin', scorpion-jumpin' super heroes.\" Further congrats to the remaining winners: Gordon Sutherland from Scotland; Ian Moffitt, Stockport; A. R. Walker, Surrey and Daniel Thompson from Belgium who will all be receiving their prizes shortly. <<<<<  THE HULK IS ON HIS WAY Ever wondered how software companies get their names? Do the company executives have strange visions in the middle of the night? Does inspiration strike as they sit glued to the latest episode of Brookside? Or do they simply pull a name out of the telephone directory? Well, we don't really know! But what we do know is that a new software company called us the other day and said: \"Look, we've got absolutely no idea what to call ourselves and we reckon your readers could come up with a terrific name. How about it?\" We thought our readers could come up with a great new name too so that's why we're asking you to send us a few ideas. Try not to copy any existing names-we want an exciting and original title for this new company. There will be 20 signed copies of the brand new games from this equally new software house up for grabs for the best names-before they go on general release. So, if you want to be the first on your street with a game NO ONE else has loaded before, get your thinking-caps on and come up with some really weird and wonderful names. Once you've worked one out, fill in the coupon on this page and send it to The Name Game, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ. Normal C&VG competition rules apply, no correspondence will be entered into and the Editor's decision is final. Closing date for the competition is July 16th Just so you don't have to set about picking a name without a bit of information, here are a few details about the company you'll be naming. It has a staff of four young programmers——the average age is around 17. They have about 20 years' worth of programming experience between them. And they really enjoy dreaming up original games! That's all we're going to tell you for now. The rest is up to you! Our Scott Adams Hulk adventure competition created the biggest postbag we've seen here at C&VG for some time! We had five copies of Scott's latest Adventure-based around that amazing Marvel Comics hero, The Incredible Hulk for each of the top micros. Your entries flooded in and we've only just finished sorting through them. Anyway, here are the winners. Spectrum: Glen Conlon, Dublin. Olawale Bajumo, London. Martin Kane, Lanarkshire. Guy Pracy, Norwich. G. Gilmurray, Chelmsford. BBC: Richard Buam, London. Hayden Nash, Cuffley. Chris Sharp, Knutsford. Richard Beach, Twickenham. Richard Capewell, Hale. Commodore 64: John MacAdam, Lanarkshire. Delroy Williams, Harrow. Mark Finch, Burton-onTrent. Keith Sunley, Hoddesdon. Craig Stanbridge, Gosport. Atari: Ranveer Marn, Heston. Lee Cawkwell, South Shields. Chris Clark, Tottenham. A. Blackaby, Hoddesdon. Warren Barr, Newtownabbey. Apple: Dan Slott, London. Kay Tin Khoo, London. Gary Solomon, Ayrshire. Mark Lieberman, Hornchurch. Adam Wells, Worthing. Sorry we only had five games per micro to give away but thanks to all of you who entered. The winners will be hearing fro the Hulk very soon! PIECES COLLECTED 6 DATE 1835 THE PRIZES The prizes for this competition are something very special. The new software house-which could carry the name you send us are developing three high quality arcade-style adventures for the Spectrum and Commodore 64. They plan to create the first such adventures featuring 100 completely different high-resolution screens created by a new \"memory-crunching\" technique on which they have been working. The game will also feature another brand new proor gramming technique called LSA large scale animation. Sounds tricky to us! Anyway, with both of these techniques in operation, the new software house reckons that these new games will be pretty revolutionary. i COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES NAME GAME I think the new software company should be called: i Name.........

The aim of the game is to help poor old Freddy reach the safety of his lily pad at the edge of the river. But before he can curl up at home, he must cross a river and a busy road. The road is Freddy's first test. There are four lanes of traffic, including huge juggernauts, which the frog must dodge to make it across to the stream. Getting across the river is easy—he just has to catch a turtle but he must be careful not to stay on too long, as they have a habit of diving under water and leaving him in the drink. Next he must jump on to the floating logs and then his lily pad is only a hop away. The left and right arrow keys move the frog sideways and the space bar moves him forwards. 270 CLS:PLOTO, 14, 4:PLOTO, 16,3:PLOTO, 18,2 :PLOTO, 20, 1:PLOTO, 22,0:PLOT 0,24,5 280 PLOTO, 12,0:PLOTO, 10,5:PLOTO,8,6 :PLOT 0,6,7:PLOTO, 4,0 290 SC=:LI=3:11$=\"aaa aa aa a aa aa aa aa aa aaa aaaaaaaaa\":T1=30:2=1 310 PLOT1, 1, \" -HOME HOME HOME HOME 315 PLOT1,2,\" aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa ! 320 PLOTI, 24,\"TIME\" :PLOT6, 24, TI$:PLOTO, 26,2 330APLOTI, 26, \"SCORE\":PLOT7, 26, STR$(SC) 340 PLOT15, 26,\"IJES:\" :PLOT21, 26, STR$(LI 350 PLO126, 26, HIGH: PLOT31, 26, STR$CHIC 1 ) 360 PLOT1,22,17:PLOT36, 22,16 :PLOT1, 21, \"b bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb bbbbbbo 370 PLOT1, 19,-380 PLOTI, 17,\"============ ======= 390 PLOT1, 15,\" -400 PLOTI,13,\"5bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbb\" 410 PLOT1, 12, 18:PLOT36, 12, 16 420 PLOT1, 11, \"bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbDDDDDDD \" 430 FORA-10T04STEP-1:PLOTI,A,20 : PLOT36, A 16:NEXT 440 PLOT1, 3, \"bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb bbbbbbbb\" 450 A$=\"efgh ji efgh jiji 100, PRINT:PRINT:PRINT:PRINTCHR$(27);\"J 2 .PROFESSIONAL\" 110 PRINTCHR$(4) 120 GETA$ :U=VAL CA$): IFUKORUS 2 THENZAP:GO 10120 460 BS=\"jijijijiji 470 CS\" klmn 488 D$=\" cd k l mn. klmn 490 E$ = \"     OP TOP 130 FORA=46080+(97*821046080+ (102*81-1:R EADB:POKEA,B:NEXT 140 DATA63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 6, 18,63, 18,18,63, 18,0 150 DATA15, 18, 34,63,63,63,20,8, 32, 16, 8,5 3,63,63,12,4 155 DATAD,7,8,8,31,31.5,2,2,55,55,63, 63,1, 160 DATA63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 16, 32,62,62,62 ,62,62,63,40, 16, 60,18,17,63 >63, 63,10,4 170 DATA1, 2,4,63, 63, 63,20,8 182 FORA=46080+ (107*80T046080+116*81-1: READB:POKEA,B:NEXT 490 E%\"     OP OP qaaas qaaas 500 F$=\" qaaas 510 G$=\" OP OP OP OP Illustration: Terry Rogers 520 H$=\" qaasas qaaaaas qaaaas "

Hundreds of variations of the game have been published by software companies and magazines, so it's not without good reason that we are printing David Estall's game we think the screen shot speaks for itself. The basic aim of the game is similar to most snake games. You must steer the snake around the screen picking up food while avoiding the walls, or running into your tail. Your progress is made more difficult by the walls which span the screen, leaving you only a few small gaps to manoeuvre your beast through. Another novel feature which David has added to the program is animated monsters up to six creatures try to thwart the snake's efforts to feed himself. Snaker runs on any 64 with one joystick.

"The classic board game chess has always transferred well on to computers. We think Neil Higgs' Chess game is graphically the best we've ever published on any machine—and that's no mean feat on a computer that's not renowned for having the most stunning graphics in the world. The game is for two players and is played just like the board game, except you don't have all the aggro of hunting for the missing pieces! The pieces are moved by placing a cross on top of the piece you want to move with the joystick. You then just press the button and position in the correct square.

"STONE OF SISYPHUS REVIEWS: which you roam about, picking up objects such as food, bullets and treasure. If you can collect enough, you are able to buy the key to the next level. On average this takes about 25 minutes a level, but just how many levels there are is a secret not yielded by the instruc tions. Of course, you don't get it all your own way. The spider servants of the evil time lord are out to kill or rob you if they can. They look like round blobs with sticks poking out and are the fastest thing in the game. The graphics used to display the landscape are all character graphics, which are not the best I've seen. As the player moves near the edge of the screen, instead of scrolling, the whole screen is redrawn which seems to take longer and longer each time. In fact, the whole mode of play is very slow and it seems to take for ever to get from one side of the screen and back again. Overall, the game is best compared with the type of game where the player runs around a maze shooting robots before going to the next levelbut five times slower. A game which looked reasonable at the start, but turned out to be a great disappointment, Time Warp is from English Software for the 16k Atari and costs .95 Paul Coppins MEJCE The screen of my Atari lit up with \"Welcome to Stone of Sisyphus\", and I sighed with relief as my problems in loading the game were over. This is number two in the Maces and Magic series of Adventure games that for some reason rarely, if ever, get a mention in the popular computer press. As the game starts, you find yourself in the general store, close to the Dungeon of Sisyphus. Here you are asked to create your own player and give him or her a name, as well as a weapon chosen from 80 different types. Armour is also available in 26 different varieties. Having made your choice, there is a quick swap of disks and you enter the dungeon itself. The screen is now split in two and the top half displays some of the best colour graphics I have seen on any Atari Adventure to date. Come to think of it, some of the best Atari graphics I have ever seen. The lower half of the screen completes the picture and gives a text description of the room and any objects therein. This is where the excitement begins and things really start to get different. Instead of the usual type of input, you are given a number of choices as to what to do next. For instance, you may use either your knowledge of Adventuring, skill at fighting, or sheer bribery. If it sounds fun, that's because it is and totally unlike anything I have experienced before. There is, of course, the opportunity to use any objects you come across. You also have the choice of letting the screen go blank while a new picture is being drawn, or sitting back and watching the computer building up the scenes line by line. I have been playing this game for some time now and have found well over 50 rooms. \"That's not a lot\", I hear you say, but in this dungeon you are only expected to last 25 minutes, that's if your luck holds out that long! My trouble is I always try to pick a fight with a guy who is just that bit bigger. Eventually, learning by my mistakes, I started going around minding my own business, when out of the shadows would step a ghoul or stone giant, to splat me meticulously over the dungeon floor. There were only two points about the game I didn't like. It took four attempts to get a working copy-but no doubt AI have that ironed out by now. Secondly, as the game is in Basic, the graphic drawing is a little slow, but then their quality is so good, perhaps it's worth the wait. In conclusion-if you have an Atari with a disc drive and fancy something completely different this is the game for you! It costs .95 on disc only. Paul Coppins dventurers everywhere liked our last comprehensive round-up of the latest Adventure games so much that we decided to let our ace Adventurer Keith Campbell loose from the C&VG dungeon to bring you another bunch of indepth reviews, aided by his trusty apprentices, Simon Marsh and Paul Coppins. Remember, C&VG will be bringing you an Adventure review spe. cial every other issue from now on. Now, on with the action ... TIME WARP Great! I thought, an all-graphics adventure for a change this should be good and I loaded the 16k Time Warp into Basic on my Atari. As the game starts, you find yourself on the first level of a vast kingdom, from MINDBENDER This is one of the Golden Collection from Gilsoft, written using the Quill system. There's a whole lot of them, but the title of this one took my fancy. Apart from a rather effective \"title page\", the game is text only and comes with no instructions in the inlay other than how to load. The first location begs a course of action which is demanded rather than logical and the consequences are pure fantasy! At this point the objective is revealed Immediately this part has been SEN CIK CINE RE B o ererate 126 "


"PHAROAH'S TOMB You are in the tower bedroom. A large four poster bed in the centre with .side table. An open window WEST over: bed looks a 100 ft drop. A door is EAST (It looks locked!). There is a PARACHUTE here You wake feeling weak with pains in your neck. You can't go that way. ?OPEN DOOR I'LL TRY SORRY, IT'S SHUT TIGHT. ?TAKE PARACHUTE Certainly, but if it kills me I'm never forgive you. I was intrigued when I came across Pharoah's Tomb for the Electron and I loaded it on my BBC to play. But of course, it was not the Pharoah's Tomb I was expecting from Phipps Associates. This one was from A&F Software. You do have to watch what you're buying these days, don't you? The instructions told me my task was to collect 500 gold coins and the Pharoah's mask before returning, and gave me a list of single-letter commands for doing such things as using bow and arrows, going backwards, buying items etc. RE HWS played out, the Adventurer has a problem to solve, which is really a matter of getting the right order of actions for the desired effect-to escape a prison cell. Once the door is open, things start to get really difficult difficult until the right word is found. And so, after many attempts, I lost my location details, and thought I'd better have another look around. This time I'm SURE I'm right! You can't look or examine anything, or regain your location details—unless the required instruction is extremely obscure. And as I said there ARE no instructions. Once out of the cell, there are some interesting places to wander about and that's just what I did. The game does seem to wander rather, instead of concentrating the mind on a particular problem. I wandered around until I fell down an unseen and unmentioned hole, and got killed off. HELP gives the reply \"What do you think this is the Hobbit?\" and score tells you \"England 0 Wales 0\". Yesone of THOSE games! Competent, but not out of the ordinary. Mindbender is for the 48k Spectrum from Gilsoft, priced .95. Keith Campbell The player starts off in a graphically displayed entrance hall, where he may buy goods-if he has any gold. The command \"F\" (forward) presents him with a peculiar green-coloured graphics design, over which are scattered letters. These form an anagram, which has to be guessed and typed in before time runs out. The letters are entered on dashes displayed underneath the randomly placed letters. Some of the words are so long that there is little chance of beating the clock. On other occasions the number of letters doesn't match the number of dashes. Various other chambers, apparently randomly encountered, present the player with various monstersspiders, skeletons, mummies etc. Asked for your instructions, you are lucky to be able to get them into the computer before the monster attacks, sometimes causing you to lose gold you don't even possess. When I suggested firing arrows, I was put into what I assumed was firing mode--but the complete lack of instructions, and of any keyboard response to my wild hammering, made this a waste of time. A couple of screens allow the player to use the cursor keys to collect gold and silver. Gold I managed, but silver seemed to have a bug, or some obscure and unmentioned command Not an Adventure, an arcade game, or a puzzle game, but all of these rolled into one in a way that makes trying to enjoy any aspect a virtual impossibility. Pharoah's Tomb is from A&F Software, for the Electron, BBC and Spectrum, priced at .90. Keith Campbell VAMPIRE CASTLE \"WARNING: We strongly recommend this game be played with the lights on.\" So begin the instructions for Vampire Castle, in which your objective is to find and destroy Dracula. The game loads on a BBC micro to the music of Toccata and Fugue in D minor by Bach-you know, the one that goes \"da di-di, da di-di, da di-di da dee\". Nice the first time, but you can have too much of a good thing, like every time you die and try again! There must by now be as many Adventures set in a castle as there are castles so, feeling somewhat over castellated, I took the plunge. This castle houses Dracula and a dumb waiter. Wow! How original! But there are some unusual locations a children's nursery for example and objects a hang glider! So the puzzles, or most of them, are fairly original within the plot. The response is fast, much faster, for example, than the Acornsoft Adventures and there are also occasional sound effects and graphics within the game. The vocabulary is limited another one of those games with no EXAMINEand commands containing unknown words are met with a variety of ribtickling responses like \"What are you gibbering about?\" and \"Stop trembling and try again.\" The game is moderately easy and should appeal to part-time Adventurers who like a bit of spoof horror! But if you've played and beaten The Count, this will be like an A-level exam to a graduate! Vampire Castle is from Micrograf for the BBC B and costs .95. Keith Campbell 127 "


"HEROES OF KARN REVIEWS: A slight problem is Edgar, a bug implanted in your neck, following your acceptance of a do or die challenge. Edgar will sink his poisoned fangs into you at the slightest sign of you making a run for it! Otherwise he will restrict his activities to commenting somewhat sarcastically on your pro gress and complain if you aren't making any! The instructions in the accompanying leaflet convey the scenario effectively, are easily legible, give examples of input commands and, most importantly, a definitive list of special commands and abbreviations. Among these are LOOK to redisplay location and STAT. The latter briefs you on your current level of Prowess, Energy and Luck, because in this game you will inevitably decide to go into combat mode, when these factors will be crucial. The combat mode allows you to try to kill any of the characters you come across which makes for an unusual Adventure. MECZMZOD Heroes of Karn is a graphical adventure with music, in which your mission is to rescue four heroes held captive by spells, and to return treasures of the realm. Each Hero has his own special abilities which come in very useful-you will certainly need all the help you can get! The game starts among pleasant springtime fields, which lead to a stone barrow, a monastery and a castle among other places. Now I can take or leave graphics in an Adventure, but I did like these graphics, particularly one of a castle by the sea. After the main blocks of the pictures are drawn, sprites are promptly dotted about the screen to add the finishing touches-the long tufts of grass, a tree, birds or a sailing ship. The pictures are displayed the first time at a location, unless otherwise requested, but because the overall display is rather slow, for repeated attempts at the game it really pays to SAVE. Is the game worth saving? I would say yes, but with one or two reservations. The structure of the vocabulary is unusual and gave me some difficulty. Multi-word sentences are allowed, such as 'Say to (someone) \"attack bear with sword\", but these will go unrecognised if one of the words is not known or if the punctuation isn't as expected. For example, if you say something to someone, their name must begin with a capital, yet the first word spoken, which must be inside quotes, must not. This inconsistency was rather annoying and somewhat time wasting, for many variations had to be tried before being sure a command was not a valid one. The range of vocabulary is rather limited and the replies give no indication as to which word is not understood. I found myself a little disorientated until I got used to the command format. A useful way to check out object words when playing an Adventure is to type TAKE followed by the object you want. If it is not known or not present, usually the form of the reply will give an indication as to whether or not it exists. Not being able to pass a bear on a narrow path up in the mountains, I thus tried TAKE HONEY and was told \"The pot of honey is not here\". That summarises some of the problems in this game. It seems there are many existing objects that are needed but where are they all? I have to admit to being currently incarcerated in a dungeon with a guard immune to bribery with companion and self short of a key. But I do know it is a gold one! I had great difficulty in getting a copy that would load correctly—it takes 18 minutes by the way—but full marks to Interceptor Software for service. They were most helpful to me. Open countries R ST the non The music is nicely done, but so far I have only heard \"Greensleeves\". I am hoping there will be more when I find Haldir, the minstrel. Clues are scattered everywhere in this game so remember to read all the descriptions very carefully. Heroes of Karn is from Interceptor Software for the Commodore 64, priced  for cassette and  for diskette. MOUNTAINS OF KET Ket is the first in a trilogy and, whilst the tape was loading into the Spectrum under a bold and colourful title page, I read the leaflet folded inside the inlay. Within this was a short but comprehensive rundown of the scenario, the objectives of the trilogy and of part 1. The background of information was p.ausible without being unbelievably elaborate and, in short, in this game you must reach the far side of the mountain. If you dodge a hit, you use a luck point. The higher your luck rating, the greater chance of a dodged blow costing you one energy point. If your luck is poor, you lose three energy points, but if you don't dodge, your luck level is retained and you lose two points. The prowess ratings determine the ratio of your hits to that of your opponent and the first one out of energy is a gonner. Be warned, though! If you win, you may encounter an enraged villager out to avenge his compatriot. Once out of the way, you can make off with your victim's possessions, some of which you will need to start on your journey to and across the mountain. A fast response and clearly laid out screen enhance this adventure with a difference. Full marks to Incentive Software for Mountains of Ket, for 48k Spectrum and modestly priced at .50.

"GAMES FOR GIRLS REVIEWS: MEUS RMKOD Hold on while I change out of my garter belt to write this review, readers! Two games, Jungle Adventure and Diamond Quest come under the collective title of Games for Girls and were written by M. Sherlock and B. Bartis who could be male or female for all I know Keith passed on these games to me to review at a party he held to celebrate the launch of his book. Feeling rather upset at such a slur on my masculinity, I trotted round to my friend Julian Crouch, to have a look at them. I have to mention Julian because he it is who has a Spectrum, on which they run, but more importantly, because I have recently discovered he is related to the Editor and I want to keep this job! From reading the cassette inlays, I had an idea that these games might be bad. \"We think (Diamond Ouest) will particularly appeal to girls because the graphics are bright and colourful, and monsters do not appear!\" Ten out of ten for the most patronising blurb and worst looking inlay-who wants to look at a pink inlay with animals in pastel colours? The first game we tried was Jungle Adventure. You are cast as an African girl who must make her way home from school. Home is in the middle of the jungle. Words fail me at this point! It is the most boring Spectrum game I have ever played. It isn't an Adventure, it isn't an arcade game-what it is I'll never know! The second tape was Diamond Quest, which is much better and seems to have been well thought out. Even so, the game has a vocabulary of precisely 14 words! Watch out, Infocom! The idea behind this game is to try to find the diamond treasure which is hidden in a palace. The graphics are quite good, but again, to call this an Adven ture is a gross over-statement. It is merely a maze game. So, I think I'll stick to my knitting! Games for Girls come from Laser Computer Simulations Ltd, for the 48k Spectrum, and cost .95 and .95 respectively. Simon Marsh Adventures to be released by A&F then I for one will be very pleased. The scenario is one of a beautiful princess trapped high in an evil-looking castle. It is your task, as the brave hero, to save her. I wonder if anyone is going to write an original scenario for saving princesses? Well, princess-saving adventures appeal to me, so I set about my task in all haste. The usual verb/noun vocabulary is employed in this game (GET KNIFE etc). The first problem encountered is how to get into the grounds a starter problem rather reminiscent of Scott Adams. This is an apparently insoluble problem, but take some time and use some lateral thinking and you'll get in. Once there, a feast of delight awaits you! You will find knives, ropes, lamps etc. Well, you didn't expect an original light source in a castle game, did you? At one stage, my knowledge of John Wayne and cowboys came in very useful. A mutant in the cellar is a ghoul who cannot be taken lightly as he is prone to kill you at the bat of an eyelid. Talking of bats leads me to the vampire whose when you have set off in your one-man favourite meal is you—the intrepid ship in search of \"quantum black\" holes Adventurer! which could provide an inexhaustible Do not think this game is without a source of power for man's ever increas. sense of humour, for when I typed in ing space civilisations.

As is customary with Infocom Adventures, the all-text descriptions and large vocabulary are impressive. The ability to type command in full sentences, several at a time all on one input line is one of the many innovations that put Infocom Adventures into a class of their own.

"CASTLE BLACKSTAR ing in the officers mess, playing chess with Out, the wonder dog.\" What can be said about Salamander Adventures that has not already been said? Their anti-heroes of the computer world are, without a doubt, mad! One cannot fail to laugh at the introduction to the latest hero, Lt. Roger Wilcoe (over and out) The object of the game is that you, the brave adventurer, must bring back the following goods from German occupied France: Black Box, Ignition Switch, Blueprint, Operation Guide, Manual and The Bomb. Easy, huh? Well, this is not a job that will take a couple of days more like a one doesn't act quickly, it soon becomes anything but a laughing matter, as further progress in the game is stopped. To escape this fate, one must mask one's fears. I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good but not too serious Adventure and I took forward to the sequel, White Cliffs of Dover. Play Wings of War and join me in the fight to win the war. Of the six objects needed, I have only two so far. I wonder how C&VG Adventurers will fare? Wings of War is for Dragon 32, BBCB, and Oric, from Salamander Software, priced at .95. Simon Marsh In playing this Adventure, you know what to do, but cannot easily find the way to achieve your objectives! The vocabulary takes a little while to get used to, but I found the more I played, the easier it becomes to hit upon the correct command. REVIEWS A game you QUIT because you want to start afresh, but leaving you with the message \"QUITTING GAME WITH XX POINTS\" and leaves your computer locked up, is NOT friendly! I always adopt the philosophy that when a player leaves any game by entering END or QUIT, the computer should be returned to its normal state not have to be disconnected before it is any use. And an Adventure requiring a reload for another try is not nice anyway. OK, grizzling over is the game any good? Surprisingly, after my bad start and prejudiced as I had become against it, I found Castle Blackstar to be a very interesting adventure certainly better than many available for the Spectrum. The game is text only and the machine code program gives a fast response. It has a good plot, some reasonable puzzles and I felt happier with the simple black on white text than with many a lavishly illustrated multi-coloured game. The objective, which is fully explained in the accompanying leaflet, is to recover an orb, rid it of its evil powers and collect treasure. Points are awarded for being clever and collecting things. The map is big and colourfully described and the vocabulary is claimed to be in excess of 200 words. Nevertheless, I found plenty of words that weren't recognised; many of them being displayed before me at the time! Adventurers, as well as always being friendly and helpful souls, seem to be more disposed to bad language than most and this game copes with the situation in an original way by providing a swearbox-a location which fines you one object before you can escape! If you're going to say something nasty, make sure you have a redundant object in your possession first! I can proudly claim to have beaten the swear box with some particularly foul language, but I suppose as a journalist I should have a wide vocabulary. (Shut-up CampbellMary Whitehouse will try to have it banned if you're not careful!) So there you have it—don't go down in the woods to play, don't quit, and watch your mouth! Castle Blackstar for 48k Spectrum is from SCR Adventures, priced .95. Versions for Dragon 32, Commodore 64 and Apple II are planned Keith Campbell COLDITZ As a prisoner you must rescue a fellow inmate from the solitary confinement cell and lead him to safety from Colditz Castle, with the aid of your Spectrum. There are many pitfalls in this adventure. In fact, you must be extremely careful to make the right moves—a false one and you'll be shot by the Nazis. On the surface, this looks quite realistic. After all, in the real thing you could get very near to escaping and get shotalternatively, this might happen during your first moves. But it will make a lot of game saving necessary, if you are to piece the puzzle together and form an overall strategy Where the realism falls down a bit is exemplified by a little sequence in the parcel sorting office which has a 'wooden planked floor'. This is screaming out for attention, almost literally as it makes a noise when you walk on it. Pass through without solving the problem and a guard will hear you on the way back-fair enough. But it is impossible to examine wood, plank, or floor. You have to deduce that you must take a floorboard and it seems the board must be very wide or the room extremely narrow, for the description changes to 'a dirt floor underfoot'. Thus the guard can no longer hear you walking through. Colditz has a fast response, even when displaying graphics which accompany some of the 70-odd locations in the game. A split screen layout is used, showing the picture and/or text description of the location above a length of barbed wire and the scrolling conversation, which includes visible objects, below. This is a competent adventure which will take some time to complete. I have a feeling that playing might be more enjoyable if those parts of the map that a prisoner is expected to know at the outset were provided with the game. This is an unusual thing to suggest, I know, but strategy could be planned from the start, rather than having to take a hit and miss approach all the way through. Colditz is for 48K Spectrum from Phipps Associates, priced at .95. Keith Campbell 131 5.6. HUOM OF WINGS OF WAR Believe me, Wings of War from Salamander, is a stunner! The instruction booklet starts innocently enough. \"Lt. Roger Wilcoe looked rather smart in his new German uniform. He stared at the ground far below as he swung gently on the straps of his parachute. It seemed incredible that mere hours ago he had been loungAlthough not the easiest Adventure around, it is worth persisting with, as it is, to my mind, the best Salamander Adventure I have played—and I have played the lot! Many characters are to be found in the game and one such is the commandant who just sits in his office until you say a word. Which word I will leave you to discover! Another character is the officer who follows you on your travels around the game. I think he must have a secret ambition to be a shadow, as he even follows you into the toilet! Not surprisingly, perhaps, of all the rooms in this Adventure I have so far visited, the room without any exits is the hardest to escape. In the room is a glass bust which when broken gives off laughing gas. If "

"hello there and my message appears immediately on that person's screen. There's no need to say who I am as the computer will do this for me. Whatever Denise happens to be doing, her w Yer last tells agaia, B odnat 12:12 er! le the arth douth are the small foothills a pair of malesti: plaat word ! ke at basust tsit inking a micro to a larger computer via the phone lines was first brought into the average micro user's price range last year, by Micronet. This is a system which runs on the Prestel computers and offers up-to-the-minute information especially for the micro user. The new piece of equipment introduced to the micro owner, to take advantage of this new application, was the modem. This converts the frequencies which the micro handles into those which the telephone system can cope with. After all, our phone system was designed for people to speak into and not for computers to squeak into at very high frequencies. With the right sort of modem, you don't have to stop at Micronet. Many people are now discovering ways of linking their micros to large, mainframe computers. Ways both legal, and not so legalgaining access to a computer on which they do not belong or for which they have not paid, for example. MUD stands for Multi-User Dungeons and Dragons. It's a version of the classic adventure game and runs on a computer at the University of Essex. The D&D part is quite normal. It's the multi-user idea which makes it novel. More than one person can actually be playing the game at the same time. In fact, up to 36 people can play at one time. Access is via the telephone lines and is perfectly legal. A special noncharged account has been set up especially for MUD players. The reason that dedicated MUDders are nocturnal is that it's only available (or rather the free account is only available) between midnight and 6 am during the week. The reason for this is that if the computer was tied up with MUD during the day, access would be difficult for genuine university students! Anyway, assuming that you have a suitable terminal (usually a BBC + modem + some scrolling software) you can access MUD. Once you've logged in to the university's computer system, you type MUD to start the game. Each player assigns himself a character which they use when playing the game and you enter this at the start. Then comes the real multi-user part. Type WHO and the computer will tell you the names of the characters currently playing. Looking down the list, I notice that Denise the Witch is around, so I just type: \"Denise, This is real time-I've missed my chance to kill the bunny again! screen will scroll up and say: \"Bug Hunter tells you, hello there\". If I want to talk to everyone at the same time, I can use the shout command. Typing: \"Shout, who's out there?\" will produce the message \"Who's out there?\" on all the users' screens. They can then choose whether or not to reply and whether to reply privately to me or to shout the message around. Talking is one aspect of MUD and to some it is the main function. You can easily spend a whole night chatting away to people without actually progressing very far into the Adventure itself. Especially if you're new to the game and are after some tips from the hardened players. This game is big. The program, including the very detailed text for all That's the locations, 2,000k or takes up over 40 around two times the megamemory of a bytes. 48k Spectrum Simply listing the program on paper would produce a wad about six inches thick. Approaching one location, I find a magic mirror. Great, I think, I'll have that. But It's midnight. The office is silent. Computer fanatics everywhere are settling down to a few hours' rest. But scattered thinly around the country, a small dedicated band of night owls is awakening. You can tell that they're around because phones start to tinkle. And you hear the desperate cry of \"What's wrong with the PSS exchange now?\" and \"Who knows where I left my password?\" This is MUD. A nocturnal sport known to, and loved by, dedicated computer junkies everywhere. It's an Adventure, sure. But it's far more. ROBERT SCHIFREEN explains. 144 "


"You can use the objects to attack players. For example, you can type: \"Kill Denise with sword\". Denise will then be informed that you are trying to kill her and can take appropriate action. If she has more points than you then she'll probably win the fight. Alternatively she If you then feel guilty and type \"Sorry\", the machine will reply with: \"Oh that's quite all right, no need to apologise\". To play MUD, you'll need a suitable terminal with some software and also a modem. Although not perfect, a normal Micronet terminal will work. Keele before I can type \"get mirror\", somebody else has beaten me to it! This is the other aspect of MUD. You are actually battling \"live\" against other players. The only way to get the mirror back from Denise is to kill her. Of course, there's no guarantee that I'll win. She'll probably kill me instead and I'll have to start again! Now, here's some of the backgroundto the Adventure itself. Most of what follows was told to me one night by a player under the name of Whizkid. This is the beauty of such a game-there's always someone around to answer your questions. As well as the constant chat facility, you're also playing a very large Adventure game. Each description, as you'll see from the photograph, is detailed and lengthy. If you're fairly experienced and don't need all the detail then type BRIEF and only the first sentences will be printed. If, on the other hand, you need all the help you can get then type VERBOSE, which is the opposite of BRIEF. The object of the game is to collect treasure. Dropping it in the swamp will then give you the points associated with that object. As you collect more points, so your character will change. You start off as a novice and progress through characters such as wizard and necromancer. Of course, if you're a female character then you'll be a witch or a necromancess. There are, in all, ten levels. Stamina is important. Its value ranges between 1 and 100, the higher the better. Stamina will help you in a fight with another player. A fight will also take up some of your stamina. To replenish stamina you must sleep. One of the first words which many people type when playing an Adventure for the first time are naughty ones. But MUD will not allow this. Using bad language will destroy you and the computer will say: \"In an attempt to keep this game uncorrupted you have been killed.\" If you are killed in a fight with another player then you are dead. Your character has been destroyed. You will have to log in again and reassign the character or create a new name for yourself. If you die by self-inflicted means like jumping off a cliff then you can still continue playing under the same character. Just like other adventures there are entures there are objects. But because you're not the only player, the objects will not always be in the same place. If Lacrima the witch picks up the sword and drops it near the well, then when you get to the well you'll find the sword there! can type FLEE, but you lose points for being a coward. Talking to a player is easy. Just type the character's name followed by a comma and then the message. So to greet Lacrima the witch, just type: \"Lacrima, hi there!\" You can also talk to selective players according to their experiences. For example, type \"novice, hi there newcomers!\" and all novices will instantly receive your message. If you're an inexperienced novice then you can, if you want, choose to enter berserk mode which, as the name implies, will make you berserk! Berserkers have a greater chance of survival if they get involved in a fight. You also have the ability to retrieve the \"longsword\" from the Excalibur-like rock in which it stands. But a berserker can't flee in a fight. He or she must stay and face up to the opponent. If you have enough power, you can cast spells. You have the ability to summon another player to wherever you happen to be in the game. You can also chase them. You may also interrogate the computer and ask it where certain objects are hidden. Wizards can even snoop on other players and see exactly what they're typing. MUD is rapidly becoming a cult game among computer nocturnals. The night during which I played I conversed with around a dozen people, from as far afield as Tokyo! The game is very user friendly. If you type a word which the computer does not recognise then it will try to help you. You'll also need an account with British Telecom's Packet Switchstream, PSS. This is a national network of special telephone lines which you access with a normal local phone call and your own password. So although the game runs on a computer in Essex, you can phone it at local rates. You can find out more about PSS from your local British Telecom office. The reason why a Micronet terminal is far from ideal is not the modem itself but the software. So if you use a BBC for accessing Micronet then you can buy some different software. You'll need some which scrolls the screen, as opposed to Micronet which starts printing at the top of the screen again each time it reaches the bottom. Although the normal Micronet software will work, you'll have to keep clearing the screen after each page otherwise the text will become unreadable. If you're using a BBC, the clear screen character is CTRL-L. On a Spectrum, you may be able to adapt the software to send the screen clear character, which is ASCII 12. It's 6.35 am and the sun is now rising over the C&VG offices. I've been talking to Whizkid, Denise, Lacrima and the like all night. And we've never actually seen each other or heard their voices. Whether this is a good idea, don't know. Personally, I'm off for some breakfast. 145 "

"HIITTLIIIT TRE GAMES LANGUAGE OF THE 80S Now, without any knowledge of machine code, you can write fast, smooth, professional, totally original games and market them without paying royalties. Even if you have already mastered machine code, we believe that the time and problems saved by writing in White Lightning's FORTH-based high level language could revolutionise commercial games writing for years to come. IDEAL IDEAL is an Interrupt Driven Extendible Animation subLanguage. Once you have mastered IDEAL's easy to learn set of over 80 commands and just a little FORTH, you will be ready to produce arcade-quality games even if you don't know machine code. Up to 255 Sprites, each with its own user-defined dimensions can be moved around the screen (or memory), scrolled, spun, reflected enlarged or inverted with amazing speed and smoothness. Operations are possible between screen windows, Sprites and Sprite windows. Sprites can even stretch across several screens, so those difficult scrolling landscapes that form the basis of so many games are easy to achieve. Sinclair's own sound and graphics commands such as CIRCLE, DRAW and BEEP are fully supported, and there are some unique collision detection facilities MULTI-TASKING Because White Lightning uses interrupts, you can effectively run two programs at once. This means of course, that games like Space Invaders and Defender can be written without complex timing calculations. So while one THE KEY TO PROFESSIONAL GAMES DESIGN HITZ 006 II 000 DO program smoothly scrolls the landscape, the second animates the other characters. This is undoubtedly one of White Lightning's most powerful features. MARKETING AND PORTABILITY Although White Lightning uses an integer FORTH as its host language, programs can be written in a combination of BASIC, FORTH IDEAL and machine language What is more, programs written in FORTH/IDEAL will be highly portable between the Spectrum and implementations under development for other popular micros. When it comes to marketing your completed games, there's no problem either. In fact Oasis themselves will offer to market outstanding software. SPRITE DESIGN White Lightning, comes complete with a separate 20K program for developing the Sprites used in the main system. Not only can you use this to design your own Sprites from scratch, it also comes complete with 168 pre-defined characters covering games like Asteroids, Pac-Man, Assault Course, Defender, Space Invaders, City Bomber, Lunar Lander, Frogger, Centipede, Donkey Kong and many, many more. These characters are ready to use or can be enhanced. And Sprites can be saved to tape between editing sessions before being finally loaded into the main program Banco Oasis Products are available from and all good software suppliers. Including: Websters, Games & Computers, Microdeal, The Dragon Dungeon, PCS Distribution, Pilonmist, Goal Computers (France), Falck Computers (Scandinavia) and Joylab (Germany).

"BY TREVOR TRURAN TEDDY BOYS' PICNIC These throwbacks from the fifties, who once nearly gave up honey for Elvis Presley, are having their annual reunion somewhere down in the woods. As well as all the traditional fun and frolics, like swatting bees with bicycle chains, the bruins have a few problems and need the help of something with a bit more brain even though we haven't the common sense to spend the winter curled up snugly in some comfortable cave. If you can come up with all the right answers, not only will you set the seal on their party but you can also compete for one of the fabulous prizes they have persuaded Tomy to put on offer. Our friends at Tomy have offered six of their Tomytronic 3D games three of their new stereo sound versions for the first prize winners and three of the unique hand-held 3D games for runners-up. E UPWORDS  Before young Cedric can climb the ladder to reach that tempting beehive, he has to make the rungs safe. He can do this by finding the 12 six-letter words which fit into the squares. He has a clue to each word and the answer is entered by putting three letters along the line and the remaining three backwards along the line above. So if the answer to the first clue had been DANGER and the second answer were REGION, then the start of the ladder would look like this: NOI 2 REG 1 DAN Thus the last three letters of each word are the first three letters in the next word.

"NEW Percy the FOR THE CBM Another classic from Tony Crowther and packaging incl. post Birdlovers of the world unite. Defenders of the weak rally around. There's a little chap here who needs all the help he can get. There's never been a bird as brave as Percy or maybe he's just plain foolish), Driven on by the instinct with which mother nature blessed him his only objective is to make a cosy little home. Percy shows no fear or is it no brains when he plunges into the path of oncoming traffic to bravely pluck twigs from the tarmac. He needs an ice cool determination (lack of common sense????) in sidestepping the attentions of the fiendish black cat and dodging the grasps of the slippery snake hungrily waiting for a mouth watering snack. Even when he's off the ground our desperate little friend has to keep his wits about him (those few he's goti, dodging an aerial assault from planes, hot air balloons and a flock of nasty twig snatching sparrows. But don't give up hope you've not taken up a totally lost cause, Percy has a masterful little trick under his wing-a battery of explosive eggs with which he creates a little havoc of his own. Befriend this loveable little bird and you'll become addicted to his zany, foolhardy exploits.

"SPOT THE DIFFERENCE starting from A, using the small stones for a bit of extra support on the way. The arrows show that he can go across and diagonally up or down but cannot jump straight up, say from A to E. As he goes, he must keep a running total. He starts with a total of 10 at stone A and, if the stone he lands on and his total are both even or both odd, then the stone value is added to the total. But if they are not the same one is even and the other oddthen the stone value is taken away from the total. So if he goes from A to Chis score goes to 14 (10 and 4 both even), but if he goes from A to B, his score goes down to 7 (one even and one odd, so 3 is taken from 10). There is one slight problem for Big Daddy as he jumps off each large stone, it sinks into the lake and cannot be visited again.

SSO 19 TEVE 0200020140 PLAYS SLINKY Slinky, the spring, was having fun hopping about when suddenly he came upon a pile of coloured blocks, so he thought he'd play around on them for a while. Much to his amazement he found that they changed colour when he landed on them. Wow! But unknown to him, the blocks belonged to the Wicked Wizard, who sent his friends along to tease our poor hero. Slinky is a real fun package with ninety-nine levels, amazing reward displays, and action replays. Where else could you meet such charming characters as Dusty the dust cloud, Marge the magnet, Ralph the random raindrop, and Lorenzo the chameleon hopper?
