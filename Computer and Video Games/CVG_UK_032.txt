"TION COMPETITION COMPETITION CO HOTLINE Joe the Lion Results Last month you came in ough to solve the COMPETITION RESULTS For those of you in the know, last month we ran a Hotline competition on the special Bugphone where you had to identify the sounds of six ColecoVision games in the order they were played However, we did have quite a few perplexed phone calls from people complaining that the Bugphone was full of weird, squeaky noises and where was the Bughunter?!! We're glad to say the Bugphone is now operational again. We had 50 of ColecoVision's latest games cartridges to give away 25 for the ColecoVision and 25 for the Atari VCS. The entries flooded in and most of you Vidkids got the answer right, although many of you confused one of the games with Gorf. Anyway, the prizes are on the way to the lucky winners and the answers in the correct order were: 1: Smurf. 2: Donkey Kong. 3: Carnival. 4: Mouse Trap. 5: Space Fury. 6: Pepper II. whers, 60 copie Spectrum, 60 aged to crack the And so Joe the Lion set off on a quest of immense magnitude -to solve the riddle of the mystic book that would lift an evil curse that had a whole bunch of software companies tied up in knots. They had lost the power to create games programs. However, Joe had one problem -although he was courageous and brave, he wasn't clever enough to solve the mystery all by himself and this is where you came in. Last month we printed an extract from the mystic book and asked you to help Joe find the names of the software companies hidden in the text. There were 180 games to give away to those who managed to crack the riddle first 60 copies of Bimbo for the Spectrum, 60 of Challenger for the BBC and, for Oric owners, 60 copies of Loki Very few of you managed to pick out all 47 software companies hidden in the text. Congratulations to Wai Fung Wong from Luton, Ben Bryant from Kent, Dane Kurth from Switzerland and Cameron Harvie from Devon, all of whom got the correct answers. Prizes are being sent out to those of you who came nearest to the magical number of 47. The names of the hidden software companies are: Rabbit Silversoft English Sunshine Interceptor Bridge R&R Abersoft Artic Imagine Shiva Ocean Superior Crystal Elephant Softek Bug Byte Melbourne House Virgin Addictive Salamander Lothlorien Ll .

By Matthew Smith-C&VG Golden Joystick Award Winner 1984 Runs on a 16K Spectrum By now, most of you will have played or seen Matthew Smith's latest weird and wonderful Miner Willy epic from Software Projects, called Jet Set Willy. But did you know that Matthew had an idea which didn't quite make it into the final version of that number one hit game for the Spectrum? We bet you didn't! Well, Computer and Video Games persuaded our Golden Joystick Award winner, Matthew, to give us an exclusive listing of the missing screen. And now we're passing it on to you just for the price of this magazine. You can't say we're not generous! Matthew has been slaving away for a couple of weeks to get this game to you we hope you like it! As you already know, Miner Willy has been spending the cash he made down the mine and has purchased a vast mansion complete with a housekeeper and a cook. Maria, the housekeeper, gives Willy a hard time about the mess his guests leave behind after a mammoth party in Jet Set Willy. In our game, André the cook has waltzed off for the evening without leaving so much as a boiled egg for Willy to munch on! Anyway, our hero marches down to the kitchen to make himself a sandwich and comes face to face with the amazing technicolour man-eating pizzas! GASP! Can you survive the onslaught of these nasty little doughy monsters? Dare you open Willy's kitchen door? Full instructions are included in Matthew's listing let us know if you like it! 58 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

Each tape contains 15 games written by Clifford and Mark Ramshaw entirely in Basic. Castle of Doom is a fairly typical example of the very high standard of all the programs on the tape and we are very happy that we have been able, together with Melbourne House, to print this listing to give a small taste of things to come. The game is very similar to the arcade game, Shamus. You are trapped in a castle filled with hundreds of rooms. Armed with only a gun, you have to fight your way through all the monster-infested rooms until you meet the dark castle's owner. Only after killing him will you be freed from the Castle of Doom. The program, although written in Basic, is remarkably fast and the graphics rival even the best that professional software can produce. With CBM software costing .00 upwards, the new 64 Super Cassettes seem very good value. @ POKE55255 POKE55_47 V=53248 FOR I=125 44 70 12551 : POKEI B NEXT POKEV +32 B 1 POKEV +33. : FOR 1=12288 TO 12319: READ A POKEI A NEXT POKE54296,15 2 POKEV +24.26.POKEV +22, PEEKOV +227 OR 18 PRINT FOR I=12352 T012991 READA PORE 3 NEXT POKEV+37 18 POKEV-38.5 5 DIN A$24) Ru@POKE 54278 PORE54292 10 FOR I=B TO 24 READ A NEXT L1=3 KB = = =6 15 POREV +16,6 POKEV 250 SOKE +1 120 POKE -39.6 POKEV +20 15 POKE2042 193 DIE 20 FOREV +422 58 GOSUB 1808 Sh=8 55 K=SEEKCKB) A=PEEKY + K=18) #8 (K=18 * 8 BEFEER V+15) AND 1 56 IF K=10 THEN DI= 1 57 IF K=13 THEN DIE 58 FOKE 2840 193+DI IF AKG AND THEN B= A=252 55 IFA 255 AND B=B THEN B=1A= B F B AND A62 THE POMEV-16 PEER V+19 AND 254: POKEV 28 R=R+1 GO TO 5e 88 IF B=B AND AC28 THEN POKEY +48 FEEK V LB OR 1 POKEV.60 PER-1GOTO 58 FOHEVA POKEV +16 PEER +162 OR BIFE = 0 THEN POKEV +16 PEERV +16 ANI 254 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"Are you fed up with fighting aliens from outer space or battling with dragons in some dark, dank dungeon? John Ridealgh has written a game for C&VG that stars a monster which is a little closer to home, but no less scary the tarantula. Spider Grid is a version of the arcade game, Genesis. The game is played on a web spun across the mouth of a deep mine shaft. You have to pick up the squares that litter the edge of the shaft, but keep a close eye out for Boris the spider. He is always on the look out for unwary adventurers to snap up. To make matters worse, the web is littered with the skulls of Boris' previous victims and one wrong step will send you tumbling down the mine.

"MICRODRIVE COMPATIBLE PROGRAMMABLE JOYSTICK. 26.95 INTERFACE for Spectrum ZX81 ONLY 26-952 ETOOpp PACK CONTENTS SUPPLIED  Programmable Interface Module as illustrated, complete with clip-on programming leads. Self adhesive programming chart detailing how to define which key is simulated by UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and FIRE.  One pack of ten Quick Reference Programming Cards for at a glance setting to your games requirements. Works with QUICKSHOT II S TRACKBALL Recognised as the only true Hardware Programmed joystick interface this product offers all the features associated with such a design. You can use any Atari-compatible joystick controller with any software for your Sinclair Spectrum or ZX81, not just those with a joystick option. Movement of the joystick is recognised by the computer exactly the same as pressing the appropriate control keys, and can therefore give the most immediate response to that movement. The hardware programmed design works with all possible key-reading methods, both BASIC and Machine Code. Eight directional movement, with or without the fire button being pressed, can be achieved by only programming the left, right, up, down and fire keys required by the game. Programming is achieved by a two-digit code, which is looked up on the Programming Chart supplied, for each direction and firing button. These two numbers are then selected on a pair of leads which are clipped onto appropriately numbered strips on the interface. Once configured this can be marked onto a Quick Reference Programming Card for storing with the game. As the programming is not power dependent the interface can be immediately used when next switched on. The keyboard remains fully functional and can be used simultaneously with the joystick. An integral rear expansion connector means there is no need to remove the interface to connect other peripherals. NB. A recent design improvement now means that the AGF Programmable Interface works with the new Quickshot Il rapid \"Auto Fire\" feature. 12 months guarantee and full written instructions. KEY FEATURES * Programmable design gives TOTAL software support. Accepts Atari, Competition Pro, Wico, Starfighter, Quick Shot, Le Stick etc. + Rear extension connector for all other add-ons. * Free demo program and instructions, ONLY 11.95 + P&P Quickshot II.

"OMELETTE BY ALAN DOWNS RUNS ON AN ORIC 1 IN 16K The Chef's away and a lot of things are cooking in the kitchen! He has disappeared and left the gas on full blaze in the kitchen. Your only chance of survival is to throw eggs into the hot frying pans to cool them down. Every time you hit one of the pans, you are awarded a piece of rope which, when it's long enough, you can use to climb out of the very hot oven and turn off the gas. However, if you happen to miss the pans and let the egg hit the ground, the omelette monster lurking in the dark corners of the kitchen can add one step to his already fast growing ladder. The difficulty of the game is determined by how hot the cooker can become before it blows up. In skill level one it is 180 degrees but in the second, it is only 130 degrees VARIABLES LL Climber's P1 Pan 1's co-ordinates CT Temperature Co-ordinates P2 Pan 2's X&Y Chick's counter SK Skill level L Ladder's MDS Melody string Illustration: Terry Rogers.

"MISSILE COMMAND You are the last hope for your planet. Hundreds of alien races have entered the atmosphere and positioned themselves in orbit around your world. Your race has been wrongly blamed for murdering the President of the Galactic Federation and the Federation is preparing to wreak a terrible, revenge attack on your planet. Using a moving sight, you must track down the incoming alien ships and air burst a nuclear weapon in their flight paths. There are four waves of aliens and the alien changes every three screens. After gaining 1500 points, you receive an extra life and when each screen has finished you are awarded bonus points. Full instructions are included in the listing! This is a version of the arcade game and has since become a classic. The highest score we've managed in the C&VG office is 20,000. Do you reckon you can beat that? If you do, let us know.

"the pit stop feature better than the racing part of the game really!\" Rating: (****) Tension mounts as you sit strapped into the cockpit of your high-powered Formula One race car waiting for the start of the Grand Prix. The noise of the engine is deafening as the start light flashes green. You flatten the accelerator pedal to the floor and your car blasts away from the starting grid at the speed of a guided missile! The closest most of us will come to the ultimate challenge of driving a Formula One car will be playing a race game on a home computer or sitting down in one of those monster arcade Martin Brundle knows just what it's like to drive one of these high-tech machines. He is a rising star in the world of F1 racing and this season is driving for the British Tyrrell team. He finished fifth and scored World Championship points in his first Grand Prix race in Brazil a few weeks ago. VIDEO GRAND PRIX Program Name: Enduro System: Atari VCS Manufacturer: Activision Price: .95 Martin Brundle, Formula One driver, Tyrrell team This VCS cartridge had the C&VG team glued to their joysticks when it was first released. You drive your Atari special in a 24-hour endurance race through day and night, snow and fog. You have to pass a certain number of cars during each lap or day-to k in the race. This new Commodore cartridge for the 64 takes you to the world famous Le Mans circuit for the equally famous 24hour endurance race. You drive through day and night time sequences TIMATE Computer and Video Games asked Martin to step into the turbo-charged C&VG special and put motor racing simulations for some top home computers and video game systems to the ultimate test. Just how true to life are they we asked? Here are Martin's verdicts on the best racing games. Martin's verdict: \"It sounds like you're riding a motorcycle rather than driving a car! But the graphics are quite good and the game is quite challenging. The joystick response is good but the car doesn't behave like a real and face hazards like ice and tricky sections of the track like the Esses-a series of nasty 'S'-bends. If you hit another car, you must head for the pits to be repaired and refuelled. There are several skill levels and you have to VIDEO GRAND PRIX Program Name: Pitstop System: ColecoVision Manufacturer: Exidy Price: .99 This brand new cartridge for the Coleco features racing and a pit stopjust like the real thing! You have to keep an eye on tyre wear and your fuel as you race. If you need more tyres and fuel, you pull into the pits and control a pit crew to carry out the refuelling and tyre changes. There are several game variations and different tracks to race on a driving game with a new twist. Martin's verdict: \"You play the part of driver and team manager in this game. You have to conserve the car to reach the finish which is very relevant to Formula One racing these days. What's very realistic about it is the way you have to look up from the track to watch the read-outs on the screen for instance, the cursor which shows you where you are on the track just like looking out for pit signals! Calling the tracks different names is a bit silly really, as they bear no relation to real tracks. I'd like the controls to be a bit more responsive -the joystick was better than the plug-in steering wheel module. It's also realistic in that you have to keep an eye on tyre wear. I liked Martin at the wheel of the TX-1 one when you hit the snow!\" Rating: (***) COMPUTER GRAND PRIX Program Name: Le Mans Computer: Commodore 64 Manufacturer: Commodore Price: .00 use the Commodore paddles to control the action The \"track\" scrolls up the screen and you guide your computer race car around the various hazards which appear. Martin's verdict: \"The night driving feature is clever — but I was soon bored with it. The pit feature doesn't really give you much variety. It's all a bit the same.

"COMPUTER GRAND PRIX Program Name: Pole Position Computer: Atari 400/800 Manufacturer. Atari Price: .95 This is the classic racing game based on the now legendary arcarde machine which you'll still see attracting big crowds at arcades and which has spawned Pole Position ll and many computer game variations. You have to race your car on a qualifying lap in order to get into the Grand Prix proper chasing and passing as many cars as you can along the way. Here at C&VG we quite enjoyed playing this game but what did the real racing This is the game that's riding high in the C&VG Daily Mirror charts and it has several features including a choice of track to race on and a choice of three cars to race in! It has a sophisticated Screen display and colourful graphics plus a fastest lap time feature. It also has a pit stop feature and you can choose how many laps you want to race, Martin selected the Silverstone track to race on a circuit he knows extremely wellto judge this game. Martin's verdict: This is really pretty impressive, given the limitations of the keyboard but you need a few more fingers! You really have to set the car up properly to take the corners. You also have to change gear and keep an eye on your revs. I was w the car wouldn't pick up, then I realised I was in the wrong gear! You have to use the brakes carefully going into the we thought we'd take him for a quick burst on TX-1 which must be the ultimate in arcade motor racing simulations right now. TX-1 is a three screen 3D graphics stereo sound monster and we found one lurking in The Family Leisure Centre in Old Compton Street Martin slipped into his race gear so he could get to grips with the machine which is currently attracting more interest than the laservideo games at this particular arcade. Atari's TX-1 offers a greater challenge than any other racing game currently in the arcades. The further you get into the game, the more circuits you get to drive on. Ultimately, you could be roaring around race tracks like Monaco, South Africa and Spain. The graphics are amazing there's really no other word for them! And the sounds... well, we'll let Martin tell you DRIVING TEST driver think of Pole Position? Martin's verdict: \"This has the most realistic representation of the track out of all the games I've seen today. The noise when you hit the kerbing is quite realistic and I like the noise when you pass other cars. However, the car control is not that good.\" Rating: (**) corners and there are markers to show you when the corner is coming up something that's missing in the other games. However, the steering response isn't that good. The track is loosely based on Silverstone but the chicane is missing. Again, there are no Armco barriers. I'm surprised that none of the games have these. Wherever you go in the world, you are racing between crash barriers! all about those sounds. \"Brilliant! It's the nearest you'll get to the real thing, short of getting into a proper car! The sound is amazing especially when you go through the tunnels and you get vibrations through the back of the seat which is a sensation you get when driving a real F1 car. You can slide the car through Rating: (****) COMPUTER GRAND PRIX Program Name: Chequered Flag Computer: Spectrum Manufacturer: Psion Price: .95 e thought Mr Brundle might be getting an itchy throttle-foot after all this messing around with fiddly joysticks and keyboards, so Martin tries out one of the top computer racing games the corners and, when you bump wheels with other cars, not only do you hear the right sound, you also get nudged over a bit on the track. The steering is very precise and the accelerator really appears to work. The graphics are great too! How much do they cost?\" We finally managed to prise Martin out of the TX-1 and remind him that he had to be in Italy the next day ready to take his Tyrrell on a test drive at the Imola circuit. Perhaps his session on the TX-1 will help him win his first Grand Prix? We hope all C&VG readers will be cheering him on as he races around the world this season! The rating system: We asked Martin to rate the games out of a possible top score of five stars, based mainly on how close the game came to real racing COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 117 "

"Do few months back I looked at some of the factors which anyone thinking of buying a chess computer should bear in mind. Now, on the assumption that everybody who read that article is bound to have bought a machine, I am going to look at ways of getting every last drop of enjoyment out of it. New owners of chess computers are easy to pick out they are the ones with the bleary red eyes. Again and again people tell you how their machine is infinitely stronger and more fascinating than they ever thought it would be and that they have been up till the small hours every night since they bought it. It is very easy for those of us closely involved with chess computers to get blasé about machine which five years ago would have been, literally, incredible. Just how good modern chess computers are can be seen in these two positions from last autumn's World Championship semi-finals. In both of them a CONCHESS computer, on one of its top levels, reproduces a match winning sacrifice by one of the very best players in the world. In position A from the first Kasparov v Korchnoy game, Korchnoy played and CONCHESS plays this neat little combination: 1.... NXP! 2 RxNRxB. 2 Bxn would have come up against 2 .... PON4 winning back the piece. way Black is a pawn up and winning. The second example, position B, from the Smyslov v Ribli match, is a real blockbuster. Smyslov played and CONCHESS plays the following brilliant sequence: 1. Rx Pch!! PXR 2. O x Pch N-B2 3. P-Q6ch RXP 4. N-Q5ch RXN 5. OXO and suddenly White has won a position The first example was simple, although still easy to miss if you are not a top flight computer, but the second really is something out of the ordinary A lot of experienced commentators thought that Smyslov had overreached himself until he produced his series of thunderbolts. Your computer won't produce something as good as that in every game (neither will you!), but there is always that chance. It's a peculiar fact that computers have good and bad days just as much as humans do. I have certainly seen a chess computer losing to a child on one day and holding a Grand Master for most of the game the next. As time goes by, your chess is sure to improve because of the regular practice you are getting against your computer. When you find that you can give the machine a reasonable game at most levels, you should seriously consider joining your local chess club. This will give you the chance to broaden your experience and style by playing against CHESS COMPUTERS your move Chess is still a firm favourite among computer gamesters and we like to keep you in touch with what's going on in the world of the chequered board. Our friendly chess expert, Jonathan Calder, has been looking at ways to make the most of chess computers — whether you're lucky enough to own one or can get to grips with a chess machine at your local chess club. a whole range of different players. Your computer might appreciate it too! When you do join a club, you will really become aware of one of the great advantages of a chess computer. You play when you want to and only when you want to. For some reason, chess matches always take place on evenings when there is something else you want to do but when you do fancy a gamesay on a wet Sunday afternoon you can be sure the club won't be meeting. Once you have joined a club, you will soon find them asking you to play in matches against other clubs. Big clubs run several teams and small clubs are almost always short of players, so you really don't have to be a master to get a As an alternative to playing in the evenings, there are tournaments which take place over weekends. Here you will play five or six games and have the chance to see some very strong players in action in the top sections. Whichever way you choose to play your competitive chess, do not think that your computer will no longer be of use to you. There are many ways a chess computer can help the more serious player. The most important is still in providing him with practice regular practice and at times when he cannot get it any other way. For the serious player, the kind of practice is very important too even friendly games must be taken seriously 120 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"If you are playing against a computer purely for fun, it makes perfect sense to scrap a game and start a new one if you look like losing or get bored. When you are practising for competitive play, this is the last thing you should do. Just as many points are won by dogged detence or by patient manoeuvring as are won by brilliant attacking play. Of course we enjoy playing aggressively the most, but the serious player needs experience of all types of play. A training method favoured by almost all strong players is the playing of five minutes or 'blitz' chess. These are games where each player has five minutes to complete all his moves and the first player to run out of time loses. They provide a very concentrated form of experience as you can see your good (or bad!) judgement rewarded on the board in front of your in a matter of seconds. This helps a player develop his chess instincts just as important as calculating ability in playing good chess. When you start to play serious chess, you will soon realise the importance of the first few moves and the value of being properly prepared for the opening. If there is a line that you always get bad positions against or one you know to be a particular favourite of your next opponent in the club championship, then why not use your computer to help your combat it? You can play as many games as you need, against the opening you are worried about. Your computer will not protest that it is bored with the opening and you can try half a dozen plans until you find one you are happy with. Computers have their uses at the other end of the game as well. While endings are easily the weakest point of a chess computer's game, because ironically any competent chess player can calculate further than a computer on a near empty board, that doesn't mean they are useless from the training point of view. There are a number of rules which just have to be learnt from books but, once you have learnt them, it's very instructive to try implementing them against an opponent. If the computer plays a move that is wrong according to the book, it's up to you to prove just why it is wrong by winning the game. You should not go away with the idea that computers are complete idiots at endings — see what a nasty shock CONCHESS gave to its fellow computer Mephisto in position C. It comes from a computer tournament run by the Surrey-based chess master, Mike Basman. After Black played the plausible 1. ... K-N4, CONCHESS replied 2. P-N4! and, after Black had taken the pawn, White's KRP was free to steam up the board and the Black King was too far away to catch it. Easy to see if you know a bit about endings, but a lot of players would miss it. So if you are just looking for fun from chess or if you want to play the game at competitive level, a chess computer has a lot to offer you. The better you play, the more you get from it. One final thought which you may or may not find consoling. If your computer does help you to improve to the stage where you feel you have outgrown it, you can be sure that by then there will have been enough developments in programming and in hardware technology to boost your machine to new heights!

And suddenly U notice this VG-like personage leaning on an elegant tallystick and bearing a strange resemblance to somebody U know.. And he appears rather cross as if he has just missed the bus.. \"This is the KEWL\" says the AGAS proudly. \"He is a nice enough chap, very brainy and all, but tends to get a bit behind with things.\" \"I think that's why he is always in a hurry especially on Market days.\" The AGAS chortles gaseously to himself and takes refuge in a swift vaporisation to render himself later\" says Ur obliging CVG, \"Now I brushes his elegant moustache and, taking a paper from his top pocket, exclaims: \"Quo Vadis,\" said the KEWL, \"I've no doubt soon that U'N Be trying very hard to find the Key To a very tricky question Which starts with my suggestion That U first look very hard at C..!\" \"It could be that U'll say A quite old fashioned way Of making notes for everyone to see.

Woe is me!\" \"I ask U for the Date When water brushed his pate, To fix the little fellow's name for good And if U've no complaint Pray tell me, who's the Saint The Lady of the House, it's understood?\" (((a) ...))) (((b) ... ))) AGAS immediately reappears having taken advantage of a slight fall in temperature to condense slightly and, recognizing that this is a tough problem for one so young, directs U to the nearest library. Making good use of the reference section, U very soon solve this little matter and set off North once more. U see another Big Red Road, this time off to Ur right. It seems to disappear into a haze and, in the far distance, shimmers in a heat mirage almost as if it is crossing another such road far away. AGAS is humming a little ditty to itself: \"Noise Mode Riding\" and \"Some Died Ironing\" and a cheerful CVG joins U on the way. This CVG knows the local terrain well and points out away to Ur right a huge plain at the centre of which U can just make out a shining monument or tower pointing skywards. \"But U'll see all this later\" says Ur obliging CVG, \"Now I have to take U to the AURIC again for it has a Pronouncement to make about Ur next test\". And indeed U spot the AURIC once more, but this time in the company of a strange, scruffy Knight. They are standing by a sharp right-angled comer in the road. \"Who is that?\" U ask the CVG. \"Oh, that's the Chief's cousin, Dexter. We think he may have been a cricketer at one time but he has to hang around this corner nowadays waiting for Adventurers.\" The AURIC is making all the signs of speaking, but is struck by a flying object hurled by an objectionable AVG and promptly shuts up. \"Oh dear, Oh dear!\" cries the AGAS, \"See to him, Dexter!\" At which the Scruffy Knight leaps into the centre of the road and shouts: Alas poor AURIC? No! No! He's alive! And must bring U now ready to face The toughest by far of the month, Question Five. I hope U are still in the race? Pray tell me then, Questor, which time honoured words Assembled in order quite free Can be made by the bits and the bytes on the board Displayed by the VGs of C?

(((a) ...) \"Fol de ROL indeed!\" sniffs the AGAS, \"Have they nothing better to do than muck about with computer games and stuff?\" \"But I see that U've managed very nicely so far.\" \"However, this problem needs some extra data so that U can instantly solve it.\" And the AGAS shouts to the AURIC: \"Make with the data, AURIC!\" And that languid extraterrestial lookalike slowly unwinds a shimmering sheet with the legend: A4 A0, A1,2A,AO 10, A0,26,A2,AO 10.A2,A9,2A,10 glittering upon it. And without more ado, the AGAS points U East and bids U farewell. Ur journey now takes U into a flat domain with the big plain on Ur right now clearly visible and the shining obelisk glinting in the sunlight. U are much troubled by this device but can as yet, find no reason in it. The road is suddenly busy with VC traffic. AVGs flying in flocks like seagulls, BVGs digging holes in the road and CVGs everywhere trying to tidy up. On asking the way, U are told: \"On, on, U're wasting time,\" so U press on at a brisk pace.

"notice the KEWL frantically adjusting the destination board from the back step. It seems to be coming from a place called 'MAYLEORDURE,\" although the dust is obscuring Ur view... U approach a big junction in the road. A Big Red Road goes off to the right at right angles and immediately after this U are confronted by two VGs called Adam and MacDonald who ask U firmly but politely to step into the huge field on the right of the road. It is empty but U hear the breathy tones of the AGAS intoning a little speech: Two VGs now confront Ur path Young Adam and MacDonald, The second never eats at home. The first, an APPLE swallowed! They bear upon their manly chests Some data for inspection Just heed their names and calculate To give U introspection. Pray tell us then the number clear, (The outcome of the feast...) And then we'll let U pass, don't fear, For now we'll know The Beast! The two CVGs dance around U shouting \"See Peyew, See Peyew\" butU see nobody about at all ... But a moment's thought soon brings the answer... is to come...\" \"Bye...!\" U are following the path of the East road, although U are still in the big plain. A BVG stops U and tells U to move South as the Chief will be there. U do this and notice that the Base is now on Ur left and U are coming to a Big Red Road crossing Ur path. The Chief rides swiftly up on his charger and enquires after Ur health and well-being. \"I'm fine,\" U say, \"What is that noise I can hear over to the right?\" **That, young shaver, is The Dragon of Herbal Hill and is the fiercest of his kind in these parts.\" \"U will have to fight him next month so I suggest U take camp here and gather strength for the ordeal\" says the Chief seriously, adding: \"And I hope U have all Ur answers safely stowed away for inspection.\" \"Otherwise U will never make it to the final treasure.\" And being weary of the travelling. U settle down to await events. THE PRIZES The first two people to solve the Quo Vadis? quest will win a complete Coleco Adam computer system worth over .

A robot adventurer could travel through a real landscape, sending pictures back to your TV and be your eyes in a truly three dimensional fantasy land. With the advent of the cable TV games networks, this may not be as far off as you think. Meanwhile, let's get back to earth for a rundown on the robots that are available right now. They won't be able to do a great deal for you just yet, but if you want to get one up on your friends who still thinks it's the IN thing to have an order form for a OL, having a robot in the house is just the thing. Read on and discover the future... ROBOT NAME: RB5X MANUFACTURER: RB Robot Corporation (USA) PRICE: Not available RBSX is quite small -just two and Most hard-nosed electronics businessman will tell you that the domesticated robot one you can use about the house is at least a decade away. These Homebots would do a bit of hoovering or fetch a Coke from the fridge. Now that doesn't sound that impressive in this age of hi-tech. But when you consider all the separate decisions a Homebot must make leaving aside the mechanical problems for a moment in order to fetch that drink, the problems are considerable. First, the homebot has to be able to understand just what it is you've asked it to do, then move to the place where you keep the fridge, open the door, identify the Coke can, grab it and return to the room where you are waiting eagerly for a refreshing drink So-tech.

It is dustbin shaped and comes with or without an arm. It zaps along at four inches per second! RB5X is equipped with a ring of bumper switches and a highly directional sonar system capable of sensing objects at distances from 10 inches to 35 feet. Infra-red sensors under its body can detect markers on the ground including a line which leads it to a charger which boosts its batteries when its feeling a bit low. RBSX can be fitted with a vacuum cleaner, a trailer and a fire detector and extinguisher. You can also add a voice device and speech recognition equipment so that it comes when it's called and does what it's told! (We could do with one of those in the office...Ed) This little chap is designed to grow as its owner's demands increase. But again you have to use a computer to control it either an Apple or an IBM personal computer. ROBOTS' NAMES: Movits MANUFACTURER: Prism PRICE: .99-.99 The Movit family comprises a gang of five of the most unlikely looking robots. They are the most basic of all the robots mentioned in these pages and a far cry indeed from Topo or Tomy They range from very simple to not so simple and certainly won't be rushing round the house doing you household chores!

But remember, you may already have a robot of a sort in your kitchen at home. Just look at the programmable washing machine in the corner that's really a robot without eyes or legs! Ultimately your entire home could be controlled by a brain which in turn controls robots to handle household chores like cleaning or answering the telephone.

"Prism ROBOT NAME: Topo MANUFACTURER: Androbot/ ultrasorted to to stop is anothollow moves in a different way. The Piper Mouse looks like a mechanical bumble bee mounted on three wheels. Controlled via an ultrasonic controller, it can be instructed to turn left or right, to move forward and to stop. The Line Tracer is another threewheeled blob which will follow a black line drawn on a white background and that's about all it does do. Perhaps the most interesting is the Monkey which is suspended from a length of wire and moves along by cranking its arms back and forth. A sound sensor activates movement Tolate an above his light to man who Price: ,500 The first Homebot to make any impact on the UK is Topo from Androbot the US company launched by Nolan Bushnell Bushnell's previous invention was the video game which in turn spawned a company called Atari. Bushnell's involvement in robots is one reason why so many people are taking a sudden interest in robotmania. How seriously you treat a man who once tied an electric light to a kite and flew it above his home town to simulate an alien attack is your affair! Topo is the deluxe model and will set you back ,500. That's if you computer which already own an Apple -the only can use the only control language which exists so far. And you do need a computer to play. Play? Well, what else can you call it. Topo can't hoover, do the ironing, or fetch you a pancake roll and chips from the local take-away. Perhaps ich is suspens along by specific functions provided you've programmed it first. Alternatively, Maplin have developed an interface allowing Hero popular home micro, thus control is established directly from your computer keyboard by means of a direct wire, infra-red or radio link Hero's one step nearer to fetching that elusive Coke so long as you put it within its reach and program it to fetch it, all of which will take a lot longer than walking across the room to get it yourself! And if that isn't enough for you it can also see! Well, in a sense. Using a highly developed ultrasonic system, it is capable of detecting movement or motion and can detect an average size adult walking towards the sensor from 15 feet. ROBOT NAME: Tomy voice recognition robot MANUFACTURER: Tomy PRICE:  Here at C&VG we realise that Tomy's VRR is great value for money and a good introduction to learning to live with a robot! What makes life really easy with Tomy around is that it will obey eight basic commands programmed from its master's voice, is radio controlled and has limited vocabulary. The voice recognition system understands stop, talk to me, pick up, put down, go forward, go back, turn left and turn right. We've got two of these little chaps up for grabs if you enter the Win a Robot competition on the competitions page. It is house trained, good fun and will be a great mate to have around.

Fred is just one foot high and can be controlled via a computer, a joystick, or the portable infra-red controller which is supplied with this little chap. Fred can also talk it's got a 45-word vocabularly which can be expanded. It is perhaps a bit more useful than its big brother it can be used as an educational tool. But it still can't go out and grab that can of Coke! hope ble as it weet high a Prism So what can it do? It can act as guard dog or fire alarm. The manufacturers claim that it can also be used to mow the lawn, but this seems at best doubtful and certainly a lot more bovver than a hovver! Topo can talk. You program in what you want it to say on your computer and this is transmitted to it via an intra red link. It also has a teach mode which enables the owner to show Topo the layout of the area in which it will be moving. Topo then knows where the valuable china is and won't -hopefully knock it off the Queen Anne table as it whizzes past.

"Basic is slow. Very slow. When you're running a Basic program, you may sit marvelling at the apparent speed with which it churns through those calculations, or moves all those aliens around the screen, but things are not quite as they seem. At the heart of any computer is a chip called the CPU (that's the Central Processing Unit). It is this chip which actually does the work of running your Basic program when you type RUN. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand Basic words like PRINT, INPUT or GOTO. The CPU can only understand programs written in a special, very complex language which is difficult for us humans to understand. These programs don't have real words, just lists of numbers which is fine for a chip, but not for a person. However, because the CPU can understand it directly, the program will run very fast. This language which the machine uses is known as machine code. So how can we make our programs easier to understand, and take advan400 LOCAL VSK 401 BLX MX%: B* 102 IF CHARSO% THAN DRAW BI MOVE LA %=016 =: 13: BLY Ai 30%, puit (data); Os LON TIL . : stuto) tausTM SINH C CEDURE 19 (2.B 48.163.) Compilers are often regarded as magic plain program goes in at one end, and pure machine code comes out at the other. But are these programs all that they seem? Will they cope with just any program? And what about languages other than good old Basic? Will new languages, invented for the convenience of the compller's author, perform well for the inexperienced programmer too? Bug Hunter as been trying them out and here he presents an easy-to-read jargon-free report. 02231329 5376 1110.29 87.216.55.66 103 21. 1045 71.9.203, 2.2004 12.30), 12.68.105.73, 202,234 6619 09 T 200 IO36.97.27 154 1.36,82 6.9.80 tage of the speed of machine code? What's needed is a computer which can be programmed in near English and not those endless streams of numbers. And so, in 1964, Basic was bom. This was a simple programming language, where INPUT meant read the keyboard and PRINT meant print out on paper. However, there was one major problem with this language: although the programmer could understand it, the computer couldn't. The CPU, you'll remember, can only understand programs written in that simple language called machine code. So what was needed was an extra program built in to the computer which could convert one language to another. This was de signed, and was given the same name as a human doing the same job an interpreter. The interpreter is a program which usually sits in a chip of its own in the computer. This means that, although it's a program, you normally don't have to load it from tape each time you use 2,62 ILLUSTRATION: IVAN HUSSEY 40,93.127, 3,62 140 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"the machine which would be time consuming. When you've finished entering your Basic program and type RUN, the interpreter takes over and translates the first line of your Basic program into lots of separate, short machine code instructions which can then be run by the CPU chip. The interpreter then starts work on the second line and so on, working its way down the program and translating each line into a form which the CPU understands. If, when running your program, the interpreter comes across a line which says go back to the first line', then it will have to start translating again from the top. Although it has already translated the first line once at the start, it'll still have to do it again each time it needs that line. The problem is that all this translating takes time which is why Basic programs run around 30 times slower than those written entirely in machine code. What would be ideal, then, is a program which could translate the enwhich means that the programs you write in Scope run very fast. You'll remember that machine code is a very simple language and it has very few instructions, so recreating some of Basic's more involved functions will often require hundreds of machine code instructions. For example, the Basic function LEN (A$) will work out how many characters are in string A$. Although this is simple in Basic you just type PRINT LEN (A$) — think how difficult it is in machine code. The CPU doesn't have a built-in way of calculating lengths of string3 in fact, it can't even handle strings d rectly. To find the length of a string in machine code, you'd have to start at the first character and work your way along the string, counting the characters as you go. You'd also have to check that each character existed before you counted it, to make sure that the end of the string hadn't been reached. Next time you use LEN in a Basic program, think how much work the interpreter is saving. your program, you are giving away copies of the compiler too! An example of this is some of the early copies of Blue Thunder for the Spectrum by Richard Wilcox Software. If you think that you have such a copy, load the first 5k of machine code then PRINT USR 48011. You'll then be in the compiler and, with a little experimenting, you can use it to compile your own programs. If you are going to try this, type CLEAR 27001 first, otherwise you'll get some weird lines inserted. To run the compiled program type PRINT USR 27002 Anyway, with all those different compilers around, it's about time we reviewed some. So let's start with one from Salamander Software, normally known for their Dragon programs. The compiler, though, is for the BBC and is called Turbo. Probably the best feature of this package is that it also runs on the Electron as well as the Beeb. The reason for this is twofold first, because it lacks all the features which mincing Words tire Basic program into machine code at the start before running it. Although this means a short wait at the beginning, once translated, the program would run at the speed of true machine code-in fact, it would Be true machine code. We call this special kind of interpreter a COMPILER So a COMPILER is a program which translates an entire Basic program into pure machine code. But why stop at Basic? Why not create other languages and write compilers for these, too? The program would have a choice of languages, but the final machine code would still be the same. Well, people did just that. As well as Basic compilers, you can now buy a compiler for Pascal, Forth and many other languages. Some companies have even invented their own for special tasks. ISP, for example, has a language called Scope which is designed for writing fast graphics games. It's not really a games designer, more a program language and, because it's a compiler, it produces machine code So every time the Basic program contains a LEN function, the compiler would replace it with the relevant block of machine code instructions and, apart from the name of the variable, the code would be almost identical in all cases. For this reason, the standard routines are converted into machine code and stored, along with the compiler itself, in the memory of the computer when the compiler tape is loaded. When compiling the Basic program, any LEN instruction can be replaced in the resulting machine code, not by the code itself, but just by inserting a diversion to the already-prepared machine code. However, there's one big problem with a compiler written in this way. When you save the compiled program on tape or disk, you have to save the actual compiler as well, otherwise you won't be able to run your machine code as parts of it will be missing! This means that if you write a program using a compiler of this type, and you then sell makes the Beeb tower over the Electron under normal Basic circumstances and second, because it's only 2k long in total. If you're now wondering whether or not you can fit a decent compiler into 2k, I'm here to tell you that the answer is definitely no. The program comes on cassette, with a tape version on one side and a disk version on the other. If you want to use the disk version, you'll have to load the cassette and then save it to disk using the instructions supplied in the manual. Other than telling the user about this transfer, the remainder of the 28-page manual serves as the entire reference on the subject. Reading through it, you begin to realise the limitations of the program which is a shame, as the idea is very good. The fact that it occupies just 2k is amazing, even if what it can do is not. The range of commands which Turbo can handle is limited. The list includes PRINT, GOTO. GOSUB, RETURN, FORNEXT, LET, CLS, CLG, CALL, VDU. SOUND and F. In fact, that's about the u COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 141 "


"whole list, but there's worse to come. Reading on, all line numbers in the Bas program you want to compile must be between 0 and 255. Multiple statement lines are out and so are all variables except A to Z. Strings are not directly supported nor are numbers with a decimal point. And we're only on page 10 of the manual! Although this compiler is pretty rudimentary, I admit that, if you're only interested in writing simple, fast games, then you may find it useful. However, a good compiler should allow you to load absolutely any Basic program which you have written in the past and compile it. This is certainly not the case with Turbo. If it's a Dragon you own, you can get a Basic compiler for .95 from Oasis Software of Weston-super-Mare. Like Turbo, it won't allow numbers with decimal points, but apart from this fairly important omission, Sprint does approach something resembling a true compiler and it will cope with nearly every command in Dragon Basic. Although it is better than Turbo for the certainly not just another games de signer. Scope is actually a programming language. Originally available on the 48k Spectrum, it has recently been improved and renamed Scope 2. Owners of Scope I can simply return their original cassette and, for the difference in price of , obtain mk 2. Scope is now also available on cassette or disk for the Commodore 64. To write programs here, you just write it as a normal Basic program, but each line must start with REM. So although you won't be able to run the program under Basic, the Scope compiler will know what to do. A simple Sys call will compile the program, and another one will run it. The compiler does not have to be in the micro's memory for the compiled program to run. This system handles sprites, graphics and sounds. Gone are those endless POKEsto various graphics and sound control registers: four Scope commands handle all the sprites, and a few more deal with music. An added extra is that everyone who buys a copy of Scope gets free membership of the Scope Users' Group. You can COMMODORE 64 ISPO mincing Words BBC in this respect, it's partly because Dragon Basic is far less sophisticated. Anyway, to use the compiler. you first write your program in Dragon Basic on the machine itself. When you're satis fied that it's working perfectly, you save it on cassette. To compile, you load the compiler and then the Basic program. The compiled version can be run with an Exec command, or saved on tape and loaded later with CLOADM. This is the way it should work-your program is perfected under normal Basic and then compiled. The reason that you write it under normal Basic is that, if you find bugs, you cannot correct the final machine code version as easily as a Basic listing. There are very few commands which Sprint will not support, although some are written slightly differently under Sprint to get round the lack of decimal numbers. Commands not available include CLOAD, RENUM, LIST, EDIT and MEM. The trig functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.) are also missing as these cannot be calculated without decimals. At the back of the manual is a list of hints to help in running and loading Loading the blocks of uncompiled program is often unreliable and a few helpful POKEs are suggested. If all else fails, the final paragraph says that \"you'll need to beg, borrow, buy or steal another cassette recorder\". Yet the warning to potential copiers of the compiler tape itself is made very clear at the front. In addition to compilers which start with Basic, there are some which have their own language. It is this language which is converted to machine code, so the end result is no different to machine code produced from original Basic, but because the writer of the compiler also invents the language which the programmer uses, it can be made more specific to certain areas. One such product is Scope from ISP Scope stands for Simple Compilation of Plain English. This new language has just 46 different words, and is graphics oriented. Although its main function is to produce fast-moving graphics, ISP goes to great lengths to point out that this is send off for your free piece of plastic, complete with special membership number and, which is more useful a telephone hotline number with a friendly voice on the other end who will help you in your hour of need while trying to perfect your Scope Program. So now you know what a compiler does. Or what it should do. There are literally dozens of them around at the moment some costing a few pounds and some costing hundreds. Oxford Computer Systems produce some very good ones, including what's called a Cross-compiler. This doesn't mean that it's fed up with writing programs! What it does is allow you to write in Basic on one machine but produce machine code which will run on another. So, for example, you could write a Basic game on a Pet but compile it so that the machine code would run on a Com modore 64.

BY ROBERT SCHIFREEN 144 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES BINARY BOOTS Everyone must have heard by now that it's possible to cheat on the Spectrum version of Manic Miner by Software Projects. Type 6031769 while the game's running and a boot will appear. Pressing combinations of keys will now transport you directly to the level of your choice. What no one knew before, though, was the logic behind the strange choice of these key combinations. But now, Bug Hunter Enterprises, in association with A. Kelly from Birkenhead, Merseyside, presents the explanation. Select the number of the level you want to play and subtract one. Now convert it to binary and use keys 1,2,3,4 and 5 to represent the binary values of 1,2,4,8 and 16. So get to your level, press the relevant keys (ie. all the bits of the binary number which are set to l) and also the number 6. You'll then start playing on your chosen level. Mr. Kelly states that this method works for all levels except the first, where you only press 6. But, the first level is one; subtracting one leaves zero which means that you don't press any of the keys 1 to 5. So it appears to work for all levels. Only problem is that the surprise awaiting you on completing the final screen will not appear if you get to the screen while in 'cheat' mode. That's it for another month. Remember, you can write to me about any problems you have either with the games in C&VG or in professional software which you've actually paid out hard-earned money for. If you want to save the cost of a stamp, send me a mailbox on Micronet my account number is 012 786 556. But if you do, use page 89, otherwise I won't get your address. "

"Since writing the article on the Japanese arcade scene in our February issue, Tom Sato has been back to Japan to report on exciting new developments in the Japanese computer and arcade industry. Here's his report. The Japanese arcade industry seems \"to be at a turning point. I visited numerous arcade centres around Tokyo and, although the games they had were completely different from the ones I saw a year earlier, the manufacturers certainly look as if they have run out of original ideas for arcade games. The current trend is toward sports simulations. Hyper Olympics, or Track & Field as it is called in Britain, is the best example of this. You can take part in six different events the 100m dash, long jump. javelin, 110m hurdles, hammer throw and high jump. The game has great graphics and the characters run and jump realistically. It's really easy to play. All you have to do is bash away at the run and jump buttons! I'm sure many of you have seen this game at your local arcade already as it is widely distributed in this country by Taitel. Konami, who produced the game, ran a Hyper Olympics competition in Tokyo during February and the first prize was a trip to the Los Angeles Olympics this summer. In addition, most of the arcade centres dotted around Tokyo had a large number of Hyper Olympics machines, which made it a major hit. There are many other sports simulation games in Japanese arcades. Pro Wrestling, Boxing, Women's Volleyball, American Super Ball, Baseball, Soccer, Doubles Ternis, Roller-Skating, WaterSki-ing... You can play the entire Olympics on an arcade machine! Personally, I get more out of watching Match of the Day, but then some of these sports simulations are quite amusingPro Wrestling for example. You can even play a tag match complete with angry crowds of spectators raging in the background as you pile drive your opponent! There are now as you'll know if you've been reading your copy of Computer & Video Games carefully — several laser disc games on the market. The most notable is Laser Grand Prix, a Formula One racing game, featuring live film of a race track Apparently Taito, who make the game, had a staff of over one hundred filming at the Fuji Grand Prix circuit. Each frame shot was analysed to calcuiate the position of the ground, with respect to the computer generated cars, so that they appear to be running on the circuit. This is not easy, since cars must be placed at the right position and angle on the screen, otherwise they will appear to be floating above the road. At the moment, the pride of every arcade centre in Japan is the Tazmi TX-1 sind the post illustration: Melvin Bagshaw END OF THE ARCADE ACTION? 148 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"This is about to change, however, with the advent of ASCII Microsoft's MSX standard, which allows software and hardware compatibility between differing manufacturers. Namco and Konami are concentrating on converting their games to MSX standard. By January, Konami had 10 of their games converted to MSX. These include Frogger, Time Pilot and Super Cobra, but their biggest hit is Antarctic Adventure. All Konami's games come in the form of an 8k ROM cartridge and they can be used in any computer which uses the MSX standard. There are over 20 of these! Let me describe Antarctic Adventure, my favourite MSX game, in more detail. You control a cute little penguin with a pair of skates sliding on a vast ice field. Your aim is to reach the exploration bases of various countries dotted around Antarctica within the time limit. You can see the penguin skating along in very smooth 3D graphics. There are numerous holes on the ice which you must jump over. Occasionally a red fish will jump out and, if you catch it, you score extra points. Sometimes a seal will motor racing game. This machine is usually placed in the most prominent position in the arcades. Forget the laser disc games, TX-1 is about the best arcade machine ever invented. This giant racing game has three large screens which totally fill your field of view, and an excellent stereo sound system. The turbo-charged F-1 graphic racing car is about three times as large as the Pole Position. The sound is amazing, especially the echoes inside and just outside a tunnel. It is quite unbelievable that a computer can generate such realistic sound effects. The machine itself is much larger than ordinary machines. It has a steering wheel and gear lever which wouldn't look out of place in a real car. It also has brake and accelerator pedals some people have found the game so realistic that they've been looking for the clutch pedal in frantic moments! The extraordinary fact about this TX-1 is that it was Tazmi's very first arcade machine. They have previously avoided the arcade industry. It's surprising also that they decided to join when most of the other manufacturers are concentrating more on home computer software. The sad fact is that there's no doubt that the arcade boom is nearing its end. Most of the arcade centres I visited in Tokyo were only a third full at best. It is simply not 'trendy' to play arcade games now. This is despite the fact that most arcades are running the latest state of the art machines like the TX-1. Most arcade companies are now wisely considering moving into the home computer software market. The major cause of the decline of arcade machines is due to the fact that you can play video games on a home micro for free. If you can't beat them, then join them! Those who are already selling home computer software are Namco and Konami. Namco created such masterpieces as Pac-Man and Pole Position. They also have versions of Xevious, Dig Dug, Mappy, Galaxian and Pac-Man for various micros. Most of them are limited due to the capabilities of the host micro, but they all have the same algorithm as the arcade version, so you can apply the same tactics. Nowadays in Britain, microcomputer versions of old arcade games do not sell all that well because there are so many different versions available. However, in Japan, the computer boom has just started. Games such as Pac-Man, which is considered out of date by the British, are selling extremely well. There is even a serious shortage of Namco's games cartridges. Japan is approximately one year be hind the UK and US in terms of computers sold. The hardware is excellent in terms of performance and reliability, but the number of computers sold in Japan is relatively small. red potential computer buyers and the computer boom never took off in Japan as it had done in the United States or in Britain. The manufacturers thought it was a great idea and after lengthy discussion, on the 16th of July 1983, ASCII Microsoft together with Microsoft US, held a press conference, announcing the MSX plan. Despite receiving a cool initial re action from the US and Europe, most of the Japanese manufacturers enthusiastically developed their versions of MSX computers. By late October last year, the first of the MSX machines appeared from National Panasonic. Hard on their heels came 11 other companies determined not to miss the Christmas sales. By January this year, there were 12 manufacturers selling some 20 different models using the MSX standard. MSX computers now represent 30 percent of the total computers sold in Japan. It is set to become the biggest selling consumer electronics product since the video tape recorder. So what is MSX standard? Basically, all MSX computers have a common hardware design and the Extended Microsoft (MSX) Basic. It might sound silly 12 manufacturers making machines with the same hard and software but they all tend to add little extras to make their machines as different as possible from each other. Take Yamaha's MSX computer, the YIS 503, for example. It has all the MSX standard hard and software but, on top of it, they built in a special synthesiser chip to turn it into a polyphonic synthesiser. Because there is no need to rewrite software for different breeds of MSX machines, the software houses, who were previously complaining bitterly about software incompatibility, are now extremely happy with MSX and can concentrate on writing original software rather than converting old material. People can now buy MSX without fear of lack of software and the large number of competing manufacturers means that they can expect high standards and availability. MSX Basic is a vastly expanded version of Microsoft Basic found in Dragon and Apple micros. It also has features of GW Basic which is used for 16 bit microcomputers. It supports two text modes and two graphics modes, the maximum resolution being 192 x 256 dots with 16 colours. It can handle up to 32 sprites which can be moved above the actual screen without disturbing it. One thing you can be assured of is that the companies supplying MSX games don't publish any rubbish. This is understandable when you consider that they were the people behind the video game boom in the first place. The MSX standard gave them the perfect opportunity to expand and they are reaping the harvest of their past effort. emerge but you cannot jump over this creature so you must carefully avoid him. If you fall into a hole, you can see your penguin furiously trying to climb out, which is very comical. The jumping action of the penguin is excellent and the approaching seals and fish are very realistic. For some absurd reason, this game is advertised as an educational game for geography! The only thing you are likely to learn is the location of every exploration base in Antarctica. Still, I reckon that Antarctic Adventure is about the best non-violent home computer arcade game ever! It was in late 1982 when ASCII Micro soft, who previously supplied modified versions of Microsoft Basic to the Far East for Microsoft US, talked to several computer manufacturers in Japan, proposing to set a standard for eight bit home computers. At that time, there were a vast number of home computers which were not compatible with each other. This deterCOMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 149 "

"(13/1LV. By Garry Marshall MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR 64 PART 3 eight bits (a byte) and so it can control eight dots on the screen. In fact, each byte controls a row of eight dots. The illustration shows the screen divided into rows of eight dots, and indicates the way that the locations in memory correspond to the rows of dots. Within each byte, bit O controls the dot at the right of the row and bit 7 the dot at the left. Thus, to turn on an individual dot, we must find the byte controlling its row, and then find the bit that controls it. If the dot rows are numbered from 0 to 199 and the dot columns from 0 to 319, the dot in column X and row Y can be turned this if we make it: POKE BYTE, (PEEK (BYTE) OR 2 BIT) The following program incorporates all these ideas and, by calling a subroutine to plot a single point repeatedly, it draws a line on a screen. The program is: 10 POKE 53265, (PEEK(53265) OR 32) 20 POKE 53272, 24 30 FOR N=1024 to 2023: POKE N.21:   40 FOR K=8192 TO 16383: POKE K,0: NEXT K 100 FOR X=20 TO 180 110 Y=X 120 GOSUB 1000 130 NEXT X 140 END 1000 CCOL-INT(X/8) 1010 CROW-INT(Y/8): R=Y-8* CROW 1020 BYTE=8192+CROW*320+CCOL* 8+R 1030 BIT=X-8* CCOL: BIT-7-BIT 1040 POKE BYTE, PEEK(BYTE) OR 21 BIT) 1050 RETURN CCOL-INT(X/8) CROW-INT(Y/8): R=Y-8* CROW BYTE=8192 + CROW 320 + CCOL* 8+R BIT=X-8* CCOL: BITEBIT-7 POKE BYTE, 2 BIT This just tums on a single dot, but if any other dots in the row of eight are already on, it will turn them off. The last instruction can be amended to avoid 15 16 When you first switch on the Commodore 64, it appears to be a conventional character-based computer. This impression is reinforced by the presence on the keys of graphics characters. It can be great fun to build up images using the graphics characters, even to the extent of using them to 'type' pictures in the same way as a paragraph of text may be typed. But character-based graphics do have their shortcomings. The images that can be created using graphics characters cannot be as detailed and realistic as those of high-resolution graphics, generally speaking. However, the Commodore 64 can display high-resolution graphics. When it does so, it gives a resolution of 320 by 200 dots, for every dot on its screen is then available. The character-based screen gives 25 rows each with 40 character positions, and the dot matrix for a character is eight rows of eight dots. This means that the high-resolution display provides 200 rows of dots each having 320 dots. The high-resolution mode is known as the 'bit map' mode on the Commodore 64. It is set by placing a l in bit 6 of location 53265 without disturbing any of the other bits in this location. This can be done by: POKE 53265, (PEEK(53265) OR 32) Location 53272 establishes where these two areas of memory are to be found, and POKE 53272, 24 positions the bit map from locations 8192 to 16383 (this is 8k, so that a small amount of it will not be used). It also selects locations 1024 to 2023 for storing the colour information. (In character mode these locations hold the screen's contents.) In the block of locations controlling the screen colour, each location controls the colour of a block of eight by eight dots. The most significant four bits determine the foreground colour and the least significant four bits the background colour. In this way, to do our plotting in white (colour 1) on a green (colour 5) background, we must put 1*16 + 5 = 21 in each colour location. This can be done by: FOR N=1024 TO 2023: POKEN, 21: NEXT N. The screen can then be cleared so that it just shows the background colour by: FOR K=8192 TO 16383: POKEK, O: NEXT K These two loops take some time to complete. Each location in the memory can store 2 CHARACTER COLUMN 23 DOT 8208 8200 8192 8193 8194 8195 8196 8197 8198 8199 8512 82078215 8520 8 ROW 1 8527 15 16 8519 8832 238839 CHARACTER DOT 152 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"FOLLOW THE BOOZER'S TRAIL! THE TEAM We are here to help you and hopefully to help you help other Adventurers in distress. I read all your letters and some I pass on to the rest of the team to deal with. Not being superhuman, I cannot possibly answer all letters AND come up with a column each month! We've had Adventure Quest, Dungeon Quest and Just Quest. The quest to end all quests must surely be Pub Quest from Dream Software. This cheeky game has the player in search of money to pay off his debts at the Chequered Flag. The said cash is hidden somewhere in the sewers. Of course, I had to pop in for a quick one before trying in earnest and was somewhat miffed when I tried to buy a pint and was asked \"What wiv! buttons?\" That is where Adventure games differ from strategy games in the latter, one is always endowed with the wherewithal to start off with. If you think from the title that this is a game to be played in convivial company with a few well-oiled friends — forget it! You need a clear head! How often does the adventurer use the phrase LIGHT TORCH? Just think about it! Now think about it again! Silly, isn't it? Who'd want to set one of those on fire? Well, that's the sort of clear thinking you need for Pub Quest! This is a text adventure and colour is used quite effectively as a code to the type of message being displayed. Response is quite fast and the game is played in real time, the player having the option of one, two or three hours in which to complete his task. Pub Quest, fun but as hard as the ground under the apple tree, is from Dream Software Ltd, for the Commodore 64 priced .95 — and well worth So here's the team: PAUL COPPINS — super-Adventurer with an Atari bias. Paul is aged 20. lives in Stanford-le-Hope in Essex and has a full time job. Nearly all his spare time is spent solving the latest Adventures and answering your pleas for help. And a very thorough job he does too! The chances are that, if you have a problem with an Atari game, or an Atari query, you will hear from reply is from Simon, you may have to excuse his handwriting. The chances are that he has had yet another rugby accident. They always seem to affect his hand or wrist..! Simon and Paul are reviewing games in our regular Adventure Reviews Extra, and you will be hearing from them month. As readers, they have, for again next over a year, been prolific writers to the Helpline. Now drafted in officially, they represent you, the readers. And if the standards of Paul and Simon are anything to go by C&VG must have the finest readership of any magazine going! So you can see, there's a great team here waiting to help you! Write to us at Keith Campbell's Adventure Helpline, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ. And please — help us to help you! Do make sure you include your full address. We have had letters returned by the Post Office with incomplete addresses and even from demolished houses, so write clearly, please (we're not clairvoyant!), and name the micro on, which your are playing. The same game can have a slightly different solution on various micros. Paul. SIMON MARSH a great guy who has a way with Dragons. Simon made his debut on the Radio Sussex computer program cently, talking on that very subject reSimon, aged 17. is a rugger-playing sixth-former from New Malden in Surrey, and has ways and means of getting his mates to divulge their Adventure secrets if he doesn't know the answers himself! If your THE PIRATE RETURNS! \"You be forgetful, matey,\" says the pirate, and sulks off angrily. Of course, I knew what he was after, but I just didn't have any to hand. No, surprisingly enough I hadn't consumed it myself I'd not found any! Pirate Adventure, the second in Scott Adam's original series, is generally considered to be the easiest. The 14th and latest takes you back to Pirate's Island — but a slightly different and much harder island it is from the one you thought you knew! Scott seems these days to delight in dropping Adventurers straight in at the deep end. Bruce Banner started off tied hand and foot; Pirate 2 starts off where it's too dark to see! Of course, Adventurers have been plunged into darkness unexpectedly before, and experience suggests that there is a lamp, torch or similar device fairly handy certainly within nondying range! That was my theory, anyway! Eventually, the fact I suffer from astigmatism paradoxically helped me to focus on the problem more clearly, and get into the game proper. My wife, who doesn't have the same affliction, was struggling! There are plenty of mysteries to work on, as well as the problems immediately to hand. Why I should want to make glue, especially at some remote place I never heard of! What use will the Pirate be this time if I can get him out of his sulk? Meanwhile, I have found the familiar crack on the hill, and even been inside! Returning is another matter and, at this point, the game has an innovative approach, and a definite link with its forerunner. Adventure No. 14 is by Scott Adams, and is available from Adventure International for a wide range of machines on both disk and tape, some versions with graphics.

Despite having a check list of many tips, I find myself struggling to answer some of the questions I receive. Other adventures have a set answer to a given problem Hobbit problems have different solutions according to the circumstances of the game. Hobbit players will be delighted then, to hear that there is now a book available to help them in their quest. A Guide to Playing The Hobbit, by David Elkan, takes the Hobbit player through the adventure at three different levels. The first part of the book, entitled Through the Green Door, explains Inglish Language, gives advice on collecting treasures and describes doors and passageways, and the characters encountered in the game. There are also tips on mapping and scoring. Part two is a Hobbit Helpline and divides the game up into seven sections, such as The Goblins' Caves and The Elven King's Halls. Each section is introduced with a general discussion on tactics and objectives, followed by a number of tips categorised as HELP, HINT, FURTHER HINT and EXTRA HINT. The last two levels of hint are written in a simple code and give fairly direct clues. The aim of the section is not to give a solution, but to help the reader help himself through the game. The final part of the book goes through the game location by location (there are 50 in all), with a detailed commentary on what to do, what might happen and how the player should proceed. By following this section, the player should no doubt be able to complete the game without too much difficulty Having perused the book very thoroughly, I decided to put it to the test, and what better way to use it, rather than take me through the game, but to answer some of the varied Hobbit problems of writers to the Adventure Helpline? The exercise proved invaluable. allowing me to give far clearer answers very quickly. Although not overlong some 60 pages in all — the book is logically arranged, written in a clear, easy to follow style and, being the perfect companion to the game, should belong on the bookshelves of all Hobbit players. A Guide to Playing The Hobbit, by David Elkan, is published by Melbourne House at the modest price of .95. THE REPLY..

"GAMENTO edib NEVER MIND THE QUALITY..! player the chance of making it all end happily ever after, for the game takes up the theme where the story ends. The setting of the events is an unusual one for science fiction right in the heart of rural England between Forby and Launchester. You start by your bungalow at Ferrier Malvis, and the game takes you into the surrounding countryside, where you may visit the village shops, your small pottery works and your old office at Geographica. There are various side puzzles to be solved on your way to solving the game itself which is enhanced with graphics. Your company, Geographica, is working on a project to produce Mappamundi, which students of pidgin Latin will quickly translate as 'Map of the World'. But this one is to be different it is to be computerised and to include other scenarios. Suddenly, something inexplicable happens, and world travel is brought to a halt even driving home from work becomes difficult. The world map has changed. Millions of people mysteriously disappear, including your wife. Thus reads the short science fiction story, Width of the World by Ian Watson, which forms part of a new package from Mosaic Publishing. Mosaic specialises in 'Bookware' complementary book and software and an Adventure game of the same name by Simon Gould accompanies the book. Playing Width of the World after reading the story offers the adventure again, and to provide a little variety. The game is written in Basic, but the Spectrum's response is quite fast. The output/input mode is a little unusual, in that the computer's reply is quickly displayed, and input is inhibited during a pause for reading. I left Width feeling that here is a game that is not mind-bendingly difficult, but certainly not a dead give-away. It is a light-hearted excursion, with a humorous disposition. For example, I had to fix a revolving door before I could enter a building. On being successful I was told: \"You didn't know you could mend revolving doors, did you?\" In the true spirit of Adventure, the player can have the satisfaction of achieving things which in real life might be totally beyond his capabilities! Width of the World includes the short story and Adventure game for the 48k Spectrum. Published by Mosaic, it is a new release available through John Wiley at .95. purist, I am not usually too keen on graphics in an Adventure all too often the repetition of pictures slows down the game and leaves little to the imagination.
