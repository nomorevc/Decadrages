"KOKOTONI WILF \"Kokotoni Wilf is an arcade adventure whose undisguised intention is to steal the title of \"best arcade adventure program bar none\" from Jet Set Willy'. As Kokotoni Wilf you must recover all the pieces of the legendary Dragon Amulet (which has been scattered throughout time) for your master the great magician, Ulrich Throughout the quest Wilf comes up against many dangers from huge lumbering prehistoric dinosaurs, to hostile alien robots, but the reward for recovering all the pieces warrants the risk. The 48K program features a number of major advances over Jet Set Willy. The games designer Elite, stresses that each of the games 60 plus screen settings is genuinely high resolution, as opposed to psuedo hi-res, and doesn't require a title to explain what you're looking at. Furthermore, the sprite characters are of cartoon quality and exhibit their own personalities. Impressive claims. Jet Set Willy fans will no doubt feel both sceptical and intrigued...

"G.A.M.ES NEWS INGRAM WILLDALEY WIN! THUNDERBIRD IS GO! THUNDERBIRD Flight Simulation fanatics are going to have a lot more flying time under their belts with the launch of a new game based on a modern helicopter gunship. Thunderbird is the third of Digital Intergration's flight simulation programs, and it follows in the wake of Digital's phenomenally successful Fighter Pilot and Night Gunner games. Flying a helicopter is much more difficult than a conventional light aircraft and Thunderbird is a considerably more complex game to play. But the game does include a feature which allows you to take on as much or as little of the actual flying of the chopper as you like. The program is not a version of Fort Apache but a realistic simulation of flying an actual helicopter. But shoot-'em-up fans won't be disappointed either as the game includes some spectacular ground attack sequences. Digital's next promised release has its feet, or should I say its wheels, firmly on the ground. Motor Raceris, as the name suggests, a motor bike racing game. The game pits you against 40 other racers around any of the top European race tracks including Silverstone and the Isle of Man TT race circuit. Prices for the two games have yet to be announced but both games should be on sale in eary August for the 48k Spectrum. DALEY THOMPSON'S DECATHLON Ocean Software has signed up top athlete Daley Thompson, to help promote their new decathlon game. The British Amateur Athletics Board will receive royalties from the game, which will retail at .90 for the Commodore and .90 for the Spectrum version. The game, launched to coincide with the start of prel the Los Angeles Olympics, simulates the ten decathlon events including the 100 metre sprint, long jump, pole vault, javelin throw, discus throw and shot putt. wh nlaver has to qualify by taking an \"energy test\" and the computer will decide if he or she is fit to compete. A speech synthesiser gives vocal scores and a voice intones \"On your marks, get set, GO.\" The roar of the crowd urges competitors forward and a multiple scrolling action creates a realistic 3D effect as the field opens up before them. Daley Thompson, who admits to enjoying arcade games, tried out Ocean's new game before he left for Los Angeles. Sweat broke out across his brow as he recreated the 100 metre sprint. \"I'll have to run faster than that,\" he cried.

"islar tannplex.. = RUNS ON COMMODORE 64 Push is a version of the famous board game of the same name for two players. The aim of Push is to form a square of nine balls of your own colour and, when the final push is made, a ball of your own colour must be the last one to be pushed from the grid. To start, the first player must push a ball into the grid from Jone of the positions numbered 0-9. In doing this, he scores points for all the balls in that row. The colour of the ball that was last pushed from the board determines whose move it is. To enter a move, simply type in a number between 0-9 which corresponds to the point in the grid where you wish to move the counters. Full instructions are contained in the listing.

Perched up in the cabin of your juggernaut, the outside world is miles away as you thunder down the motorway to your destination, hundreds of miles over the horizon. But, there are a couple of weeks a year which every truckie hates summer holiday month. Cars jam packed with irrate drivers, bawling children and very hot passengers pour onto the usually calm motorways on their way to the seaside resorts and channel ports. The program has been written in two parts. Type the first program into the computer, save it onto tape, clear the machine memory then enter part two and save that onto tape as well. -We .)

"It is not often that the hardened members of the Computer & Video Games' review team get enthusiastic. I mean, when you've zapped as many aliens as they have, no computer game seems that big a deal. Well, David Brimley's game, The Enchanted Castle, certainly shocked our review team into a fervour of enthusiasm. The one problem with the game is that the listing is very long — it takes up the entire memory of a BBC model B. We decided that we couldn't fill the whole magazine with one listing, but we also decided we couldn't deny our BBC readers the chance to play one of the best games we've ever come across. So we've compromised. This month we've printed the first half of the listing and the final part will be published in the October issue of C&VG. Basically, the game is a graphical Adventure game set in a seemingly deserted castle, but we guarantee that the graphics will knock your eyes out. To find any of the words the game understands, simply type in the keyword VOCAB. BY DAVID BRIMLEY Enchanted Castle RUNS ON A BBC MODEL B * *** WD "

Hundreds of space ships have been hijacked, their contents looted and the crew and passengers butchered to death. A widescale panic has spread across the galaxy and almost all the trade between member planets of the Galactic Federation has ceased. As one of the top young pilots in the Federation Space Academy, you have been chosen to take charge of the Zodiac, the Federation's fastest ship and the only craft capable of catching the pirates' space bikes. After having tracked the pirates down to a remote and barren planet at the edge of the Federation's sphere of influence, the pirates attack the Zodiac with their full force. Even your ship is unable to withstand such an attack and you have no option but to land your battered ship on the nearest planet. With only one operational laser cannon, you must hold tight until reinforcements come to your rescue if they can find this remote corner of the galaxy, that is. The 1 and 2 keys move the Zodiac left and right and the 0 key fires the laser cannon. Illustration: John Higgins RUNS ON A SPECTRUM 16K BY JULIAN CROUCH 94 "

Its inhabitants had denounced violence after the Crystal Dawn of Zarg. From that time until now, not a fist or a voice had been raised in anger in any Kalon city. Until they came yesterday, at dawn, splitting the achievements of generations in three short hours. The Kalons had no choice. It was fight or die and fight they would even though their whole civilisation would never be the same after the battle whatever the outcome. The best the Kalons could hope for was to defeat the Fire Demon and hope that they would live to serve the higher principles of peace and justice in the future. Whether Kalos will remain the bastion of peace in the Third Sector, no one can say. But already in the Pleasure Domes and Relaxation y Centres the people were talking about the Star 5 Warrior as the next Kalon general. Will you take the job? Will you become Star z Warrior, commander of the last remaining Kalon laser base and only defence against the Fire Demon? If the answer is yes, then get this listing into your Atari as quickly as possible and start blasting those Fire Demons. **** ** Illustration: Dorian Cross "

To begin with, you Titanic must raise enough cash to finance an expedition to find the sunken wreck and find and recover gold that was on board. This is quite fun, for there is a selection menu of 15 likely sources on finance and you must gamble, to a certain extent, on which will offer you the most. I found a publishing company that was being quite generous (could it have been EMAP??!) so I took advantage of their offer of ,000. I then went shopping for same NASA photos of large objects in the search area, expert diving teams, repair kits for the ship and supplies. The next part of the game involves shifting your ship around the sea by using direction keys and it jumps about 0.5 centimetres per time. If you have been wise enough to purchase a photo, about 17 pink spots mark the sea at the positions of large objects. On arrival at one of these, the chances are that you will have run straight into an iceberg.

What have I done to deserve it? Star Trek was never like this! Things soon take a turn for the better (or worse, depending upon how you look at it) for I have to make a death-defying escape from the stellar patrol ship, Feinstein, using one of its many escape pads. I then found myself on a totally alien world, my only belongings being what I was wearing at the time Feinstein met its untimely end, plus a scrubbing brush, a survival kit and a towel with the words DON'T PANIC on it. As if I would! As luck, or Infocom would have it, I had come down right next to a large alien complex. After exploring and enjoying the local scenery, it soon became clear that this planet was in a good deal of trouble and it was down to me to put it right. As it was an alien planet, all the signs and other reading matter were in an alien language. This proved a real torment to translate. You are not quite alone, for help is at hand in the shape of B-19-7, known to his friends as Floyd. Floyd is a robot and, as robots go, he is a little strange. Floyd refuses to grow up and act like an adult robot — he prefers playing hide and seek and writing on walls to doing any actual work. Mind you, he has a vital part to play, for you will not complete this Adventure without him. In fact, I dare say you would end up stone dead. I found Planetfall to be a very humourous science fiction Adventure and a refreshing change from the usual. To play it, you'll need a good sense of humour and not a little patience, to put up with Floyd's mischievous behaviour he can be a real pest at times. If you have these qualities, then you and Planetfall should get along just fine. Planetfall is from Infocom for Atari 32k, Apple II 32k, IBM PC 48k, Commodore 64, TRS-80 Models I and III 32k, TI professional and PDP-11. Price is dependent upon version.

"GAMES, GAMES, GAMES When the 64 was launched about a year and a half ago, there were very few good games around. The Spectrum was the top selling micro of the time and most of the software companies were writing for the Sinclair machine. But things have changed now and many writers have realised that the 64 is a powerful machine. It has the capability for the best sound of any micro and is the only one to have a built-in synthesiser chip. The Hobbit is a top-selling Adventure from Melbourne House and runs on the 64. Continuing the storybook theme, Alice's Adventures in Videoland is a new game from Audiogenic. The official Pitfall is available at .95, which is far cheaper than the original Atari cartridge version. Sports fans will know about International Soccer, which comes on a cartridge at .99. Spectrum hit, Manic Miner, is available from Software Projects, and a version of Jet Set Willy is planned. My favourite shoot-up game of the moment is Gyruss but, at around , it's not cheap. And if you want a maze game with a difference, try Cavelon from Ocean. BUG HUNTER'S GUIDE TO ... Are you baffled by all the different computers available? Are you having trouble deciding which to buy? Do you need something to cover all those cracks in your bedroom wall? This the first in a series of cut-out wallcharts. Every month we'll be featuring a different micro. You can stick them on your wall or put them in an album or scrapbook. Then, when we've been through all the machines, you'll have all the info you need for all the popular micros around at the moment. When you start talking about computers at school or work, you'll be the first with the facts. .. THE COMMODORE 64 LOADING GAMES OUR BEST EFFORTS Computer & Video Games has been publishing listings for the Commodore 64 ever since it was launched. You can get back issues of the magazine from our offices in Peterborough. Give them a ring on 0733 264666 for details. So get your typing finger ready and try some of these past classics: Crash or Crush in 3D by Mike Singleton from October 1983, Rox 64 by Jeff (Llamasoft) Minter in January 1984, Castle of Doom by Melbourne House, June 1984. Games for the 64 come on cartridge, cassette or Alternatively, type LOAD and press return then disc. Cartridges load with no problems, but start the cassette playing. Once the program has remember that you must always turn off the loaded, you'll have to type RUN (and press return). computer before plugging in or removing a If you have a disc drive, connect it to the cartridge. computer and turn it on. Then open the door and Cassettes are normally loaded by holding down insert the disc. Close the door and type the SHIFT key and pressing the RUN / STOP key LOAD\"*\",8,1 and the game will load. You may at the same time. Then, press the PLAY button and have to type RUN after the first part of the game the game will load and start automatically. has loaded. GRAPHICS AND SOUND The Commodore 64 has the best help you to program the SID chip. sound facility of any micro around at As well as normal text and the moment. The heart of the system programming mode, the 64 has a hi is the SID chip which stands for res graphics mode with a resolution Sound Interface device. The sound of 320 X 200 dots. Each of the dots output comes from the television can be controlled independently of speaker which produces much any others. Hi res mode uses 7000 better quality than having a small bytes of RAM in addition to that built-in speaker as found in the BBC normally used by Basic. and Spectrum, for example. Graphics mode is more compliThere are three sound channels on cated to use than normal text mode. the 64, but unfortunately there are no Basic commands like clear screen special Basic commands to handle and PRINT will not work and you'll the sound. You have to use special have to write your own routines in POKES unless, that is, you have either Basic or, for more speed, one of the special programs which machine code. MORE DETAILS Commodore are based in Slough. You can get details of their computers or software on Slough (0753) 74111. A good general book to read is The Commodore 64 Exposed by Bruce Bayley and published by Melbourne House. If it's pictures and music that you like, then try Commodore 64 Graphics and Sound published by Granada at .95. To make your micro think, try Artificial Intelligence on the Commodore 64, published by Sunshine at .95. EXPANDING THE 64 The computer comes with a standard 64k of RAM. However, not all of this is available for Basic programs. In fact, unless you resort to clever machine code tricks, you only have around 38k for Basic. Writing purely in machine code, though, you can get more memory to play with. The standard disc drive for the machine is the 1541 which is very slow and not recommended. At , it's not really worth buying. The new fast-loading cassettes will actually load faster than from a 1541 drive. However, a lot of new disc-based American software is becoming avaiable over in Britain. Commodore computers use an IEEE connector as opposed to Centronics or RS232 and a new range of official peripherals has recently been launched, including the new, faster 1542 disc drive. If you're after a printer, then there's the new MCS 801 colour version at  or a black and white model at . A daisywheel letter-quality printer will cost you about . As an alternative to Commodore printers, Alphacom produces a cheap thermal printer which will link to a 64. Total cost, around . If you want a package to help with programming graphics and sound, then Simons' Basic is an extension to the 64's programming language and adds commands to deal with graphics and sound while avoiding all those POKEs. It costs around . "

"MARATHON MOUSE You would think that running around a laboratory maze all day in search of the best cheese the British taxpayer can afford would keep a mouse pretty fit and healthy. But for Herbert all was not well what is the use of four physically perfect legs when all the brain has to do is tell them to \"follow that nose\"? Which was why his keeper found him curled up in the corner one day obviously suffering from the blues. To give the little fellow something to occupy his grey cells, he has contructed this maze in which Herbert knows where the cheese is but must take a different route to reach it each time. Herbert can go RIGHT, UP or DIAGONALLY RIGHT, as his instinct only lets him travel towards the corner where the cheese is. He now scampers about quite happily, searching for a route which is not identical to any he has taken before. But he also has a problem too big for his tiny brain to fathom just how many different ways are there to get from the bottom left comer to the top right? You can try finding each route and counting them all, but there is a much simpler way of working it outand maybe letting your micro crunch the numbers. When you have found the answer, send it in on a postcard, together with your name and address, and you could be one of 10 people lucky enough to win an exclusive Compiler & Video Games tee-shirt! IN AND OUT Can you give a rational explanation to the little story depicted in this set of pictures? If so, send it to us at C&VG. The best explanation will win some software for your micro. Don't forget to tell us what it is! UU Snu T SHOP lief FB FOUR IS NO SQUARE ILLUSTRATION: TERRY ROGERS. \"It is perfectly simple,\" said Fred. \"At least, it is supposed to o be. I have made eight Z shapes of four squares each and one T shape, also of four squares.\" \"So what's the problem?\".  \"I've been trying for hours but no matter how I fit the pieces F onto the board, I cannot cover it completely.
