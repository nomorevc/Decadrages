"WORD UP WITH GARTH t's a real scorcher this month and just like the weather, CVG's hotter than ever. SFII Championship Edition hits the handhelds on the Engine GT whilst the SNES finally gets the SFII Turbo version it's always wanted. We show you the latest moves to perform with the bosses on page 34. This month also sees a real line up of new consoles just skulking around the corner and ready to give Sega's Mega-CD a bit of stiff competition. Commodore's 32 Bit machine should be hitting the streets in September and the 3DO will be following it in the new year so on page 22 we've put the two machines under the microscope. As we write, we've just got the news that Sega have just signed the papers for Streetfighter II Championship Edition Hot or what? Who knows what's going to happen next on the streets? We do. So get inside and find out today what the other mags will be telling you tomorrow! See ya GARTH CVG CREW NEWS LOTUS HOCUS POCUS The Lotus Esprit S4 is a nice car. Just about ,000 worth of nice car. So why Gremlin should want to allow a joystick-wielding, speedcrazed loony like our editor to be let loose in one to celebrate the launch of its Lotus driving game was beyond us. Gremlin is well proud of its association with Lotus and rightly so. But, the CVG boys were very less than chuffed to be associated with Garth when news of his exploits came to their attention. Apparently, out of the thirty or so drivers who turned up on the day, only one person from the whole bunch managed to drive so badly as to frighten the professional driver that was with him. \"I missed a gear on the bend and span out\", he whined, \"and it was a left-hand drive car, and I thought that the gearknob was a joystick\". Spy's tells us that as the car pirouetted towards the fence the professional asked me if I'd ever span a car before. \"Not one this expensive\" I said\". He's now been grounded from driving until he gets a little more used to key driving skills like using brakes, slowing down for corners and not taking his hands off the steering wheel to tie his hair back.

GARTH Garth's not much fun at parties. Only the other week he turned up at Jon's party after everyone had left, tidied up the kitchen and wandered off home again. Few people are brave enough to invite him to their beanos because he tries to play old seventies records and prances around in sad flares doing John Travolta impressions.

He always manages to end up on his own too, and has a habit of falling asleep an hour after arriving anywhere. There'll be no more partying for our Gaz when he moves down to Bath, where the drinks are full of twigs and flies and his only friend will be Gertrude the three-legged cow! Still, at least she'll keep him busy until he can plan a way to come crawling back to OOOOO JON Jon's parties are now legendary in CVG circles as a succession of north London flats have been trashed by errant staff members, Essex Supermodels and all.

"First ever 32-bit games machine! NEWS NEW NEW in just a couple of weeks, Commodore launches the Amiga CD32 the world's first 32-bit CD console! The machine is being hyped as the next generation of Amiga games machine, taking over from the beige computer range which is now almost ten years old. The CD32 is a stylish black number with a four-button SNES-style joypad and built-in top-loading CD drive. Based around the state-of-the-art Amiga 1200 technology, it's not only the world's first 32-bit console, but the first ever stand-alone CD games machine! AMIGA CD CONSOLE ARRIVES! 32blt Commodore JUGI CD he CD32 goes on sale at the end of August at a price of  although there are rumours that the price could drop to as low as  by this Christmas! Games CDs are set to sell around the -30 mark, which means that all-round, the CD32 will be a much cheaper machine than its nearest rival, the Sega Mega-CD. The first games to appear on CD32 will include Zool 2 from Gremlin, Diggers and James Pond 2 from Millennium, an enhanced version of The Chaos Engine and, of course, Ocean's Jurassic Park If the CD32 takes off, it could spell the end of the old Amiga games computer. The recent A1200 machine will survive, but the bog-standard A600 isn't expected to live on for long. But if you buy a CD32 and want to use it as more than just a games machine, don't worry Commodore will be launching a whole range of add-ons, including a keyboard, mouse and disk drive. Early tests show that the new console is compatible with around 60% of existing Amiga software. Like most CD-based machines, the CD32 isn't capable of Full Motion Video just yet, although there is an expansion port for an FMV cartridge to be plugged in, allowCommodore's Amiga CD32 in all it's glory. Wonderful, isn't it? Amiga CD32 easily beats its rival CD platforms with 256 colours, high CPU speed and the double speed drive. And the big bonus is all that lovely RAM to play with. Andrew Hewson 21ST CENTURY ENTERTAINMENT Commodore's joint MD's David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot beaming about their potentially world-beating bit of plastic. "


"32bit GAMES CD Commodore claims that between 50 and 100 titles will be launched for the CD32 between now and Christmas. Unlike Sega and Nintendo, Commodore is encouraging thirdparty software developers to write games for the machine freely, with no need for expensive licenses from the manufacturer. The good news is that most Amiga publishers, including Psygnosis, Team 17 and Virgin are already 100% behind the new machine, which means that there should be no shortage of games once the ball gets rolling. Games currently in development include: The Amiga CD 32 in all it's glory. Again TECH SPEC So, what kind of technical muscle does this Amiga CD32 pack then? Well, it's very similar in power to the A1200 computer, which isn't bad at all. And many of its rivals will have a really tough time trying to compete with it. For example the Mega-CD can display up to 128 colours on screen at a time, right? Well, the CD32 can do up to 256 THOUSAND colours on screen at a time! Also the CD32 boasts a 14MHz 68ECO 20 processor based around the AGA (advanced graphics architecture) chipset, 2 Megabytes of RAM (compared to the Mega-CD's 128K) and full Amiga stereo sound. That makes the CD32 by far the biggest, toughest games console on the block. Lou Eggebrecht, the technical mastermind behind the CD32. He should be called Lou Egghead. ing for interactive movies, pop music videos and all that sort of thing to be played. The module should be released this Autumn, bundled with an FMV CD, and cost \"under \". Commodore has had its fingers burnt once before with a CD-based Amiga the cumbersome CDTV machine never took off, but with much cheaper price, better technical spec and the support of the games I think it's quite good really. It's an above-average bit of hardware for a belowaverage price.

A lot of companies claim to have the future of computer gaming'. But with the CD32 we have seen the future. industry's biggest names, the CD32 looks like it could be the next big thing in the gaming world. Enough to give Sega and Nintendo sweaty palms? Probably. Sega is on record as saying that, although it has the technology to produce a 32bit CD console, it won't because it couldn't sell it cheaply enough. It doesn't seem to have stopped Commodore, though... This is THE most exciting technology. I'm sure that with Commodore's track record the CD32 will be a tremendous success in Europe.

Streetfighter II CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION comes to the Sega... and CAPTAIN CARTRIDGE dispenses software justice to one and all... IT'S CHAOTIC!  MATT BLACK 0733 315439 Sent from the other side of the galaxy to deliver software justice to the needy of the planet Earth, Captain Cartridge has already received sackfuls of mail after his debut appearance in CVG last month. Unfortunately, most of the begging letters have been obvious fakes, sent by people who have no genuine sob story to tell, and the Captain knows exactly what to do with those... file them in the bin! But there are always a few genuine needy causes out there, and it's to them that Captain Cartridge dispenses his aid, sending out free games to those who, through no fault of their own, are missing out on the fun that the rest of us take for granted. So let's delve into this month's mailbag... Dear Captain Cartridge My mum and dad are on the dole. I have only got Axis F2 and Sonic and I am bored bored bored. My grandma bought my Megadrive for a Christmas present but refuses to pay  for a game. I have got a paper round so I can buy your excellent mag and try to save for a game. So please please please send me Mega lo Mania or any other game. Ricky Rees, Doncaster THE CAPTAIN SAYS: I am only too happy to help you in your predicament. Unfortunately, the top corner of your letter was torn off, so I can't read your full address. Write back to me, telling me what it is, and I'll be only too happy to send you something to cheer you up. he Acorn Archimedes might not be the most popular games machine in the world, but the software released for it is actually better than on most other floppy formats. The latest title to be causing a big splash in a little pond is Spheres of Chaos, an arcade blaster that's already picked up a 94% ratFrenetic Asteroids-style action in Spheres of Chaos the best reason to ing on Radio One's buy an Archimedes yet. games review slot. \"With a simultaneous four player option, it dumps on most console releases\" reckons Dominik Diamond. Classic games like Elite and Virus all started life on little-known BBC machines, so who knows where Spheres of Chaos may end up? The creators are looking for a publisher to convert the game onto other formats, so if you're an interested software bigwig, give 'em a call why not? Dear Captain Cartridge Please come to my resue. I have been deeply distressed ever since my cousins came to visit from Oxford. When my cousins saw my SNES, of course, they started playing my game, and when I wasn't about they couldn't get the game out properly and so they pulled the game out and broke the connector from the game to the machine. Please Captain Cartridge, please come to my aid, could you send me a replacement? The game was Final Fight. Brendan Campbell, Northern Ireland THE CAPTAIN SAYS: Oh yes, I am only too familiar with the \"dozy relative broke my game\" syndrome. Unfortunately I have been unable to lay my hands on a copy of Final Fight, but I am only too happy to send you another top SNES title to make up for it. Just don't let your dingbat cousins anywhere near it. IT'S CHAMPION SEGA STREETFIGHTER! Dear Captain Cartridge Could you fix it for me so that you could get me Cool Spot? I have had a Megadrive for over a year and only got Road Rash and Sonic. I have played Cool Spot once at my mate's house and loved it. Could you please please please print this letter? Thanks a lot, Chris Antooka, Edmonton  SEGA 071 373 3000 THE CAPTAIN SAYS: Ask and it shall be given. A copy of Cool Spot will be winging its way to you shortly. After months of negotiation with Capcom, Sega have just got the go ahead for Streetfigther II Special Championship Edition. As we write the ink is still wet on the contract that could give Sega its biggest selling game on the Megadrive ever. Andrew Wright of Sega, managed to say through a cheesy grin, \"We fully expect it to be the bigger than even Sonic II and anticipate it could be the number one Christmas game.\" The game will be Sega's first ever 24 Meg cartridge release and is expected to hit the shops in October costing a gob-smacking .99. Will it be any good? DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM? CAN NO-ONE ELSE HELP? If so, contact Captain Cartridge! The most generous man in the Galaxy has joined up with CVG and is waiting for your letter genuined needy causes only, please, as the Captain can spot a fake a mile off.

"FANTASTIC! MARVELLOUS! VOLUPTUOUS! PHILIPS disc Interactive The once-thriving British film industry may be on its last legs, but tucked away in a quiet village in Dorking there's a new generation of movie technicians, programmers and would-be actors beavering away with their film cameras.

Once you've got over the formidable appearance of the beast, the concept behind Philips' CD-I player is simple. The design purposely mirrors that of a conventional video player and compact disc deck spliced together and is meant to blend into any living room around the globe. Once you've grasped the idea that 20 Philips believes it's created the ultimate home entertainment system for the whole family and, now the standard and design of its Full Motion Video cartridge is finalised, the icing is firmly set on the cake. Little Johnny can slap in the latest LucasArts CD Star Wars flight sim, dad can take a photography lesson on the player and the whole family can settle down to watch the latest movie releases in crisp Dolby CD stereo sound! You see, unlike Mega-CD and most other CDROMs, FMV has achieved on CD-I what no other system can offer the complete, fully-rounded home entertainment package. some of the previous disks, graphics, music, speech and animation have always been of the highest quality and put every other home computer format to shame.

"ccording to most industry pundits, the future of gaming currently lies with compact disc. If they're right, then you could well find yourself blasting away on either of the two new 32-bit based CD consoles, 3DO's Multiplayer or Commodore's Amigabased CD32. Want to know a bit more about 'em? CVG puts the machines head-to-head! 3DO vs CD32 WHICH HIT ONE WILL YOU BUY? CD32 WHAT ABOUT THE DISC DRIVE? 38552 Price  Launched: Out Now Sicate expect soon on CD32! UNDER THE HOOD The CD32 has a double-speed drive, capable of reading CDs much faster than conventional audio CD players. To prevent any pauses while the machine accesses the disc, there's 2Mb of buffer RAM which the upcoming sections of games are loaded into before you reach them. Commodore also claim the machine is expandable to full computer spec. To do this they've given the CD32 a full version of the Amiga Workbench operating system and are currently developing a disk drive and keyboard for it. Whether or not this will interest people who will be buying CD32 primarily for games remains to be seen. Psygnosis Microcosm looks a CD32 treat GAMES, GAMES, GAMES! Undeterred by the spectacular crash and burn of their CDTV, Commodore have continued to push forward with CD technology and, with very little fanfare, have caught the major players totally unaware by pushing out the first CDbased 32-bit console! The imaginatively titled CD32 is a landmark machine, regardless of what the future holds in store for it. Not only is it the first 32-bit console to hit the UK, it's the first one on sale any where in the world. This is the one machine Commodore must sell, as recent financial losses have left them in a very unstable position. Their original intention was to get the machine on the shelves for a mere , which would have destroyed all the competition. Unfortunately for us, exchange rates and other complicated market and production business has forced the price up to its current , although industry sources suggest the price could drop to below  in the future. The tech-spec is certainly impressive. At the heart of the CD32 is a powerful Motorola 68020 processor, which also drives Commodore's successful A1200, giving it a running speed of 20Mhz. To you and me that means almost twice the speed of Sega's Mega-CD and five times that of the SNES. All that processing power wouldn't mean squat if the machine couldn't cut it in the graphics department. For this Commodore have again tumed to the A1200, and produced a re-worked version of its AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture) chipset, which is capable of displaying an incredible 256,000 colours from a palette of 16,800,000. According to techy-bods, that's the maximum amount of colours the human eye can perceive, so there you go. Currently there are only three titles available for the CD32, although we're promised between 50 and 100 by Christmas. All the major companies are developing for it, although many of the forthcoming games are merely conventional Amiga games re-worked slightly for the new format. The retail price is certainly good news though, with games coming in at between .99 and .99. "


"3DO Panasonic 3DG CONTROLLER MOVIES ON DISC Price  (estimated) Launched: Early '94 US '95 UK Panasonic 32bit JURASSIC 3DO-is this THE machine for the 90s? Aside from any technical advantages the console may have, the awesome array of names attached to it could just give 3DO the edge in the upcoming battle of the 32bit consoles. doesn't have to worry about crunching the extra information while you're trying to shoot things. Instead of manufacturing the console themselves, the 3DO Company are selling the manufacturing rights to whoever can stump up the asking price. This means that there will actually be several different versions of the machine on the market at once. Because of contractual stipulations, it's highly unlikely that we'll see companies trying to cut each other, but on the plus side they're guaranteed to be compatible. ICHAEL While the talk over here is about the CD32, on the other side of the Atlantic the buzz word on everyone's lips is 3DO. The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, as they call it, is the result of several years of research by The 3DO Company a conglomeration of some of the best home computer brains brought together by Electronic Arts' founder, Trip Hawkins. Within a relatively short space of time their work had attracted interest from some of the largest media companies in the States, including Time Warner and AT&T, and has built up an impressive list of software. > Wet 459 153 Both machines have FMV cartridges in development. These gadgets will let you play Full Motion Video CDs on the respective consoles, but they'll set you back at least  extra. Two months ago all the major players in the FMV field got together to agree an industry standard for their releases, which basically means you'll be able to run FMV disks on any machine with the right set-up. The advantage of this is that FMV movies are clearer than usual VHS films, although seeing as standard CDs can only store 76 minutes of film, it means that you'll need to swap some disks half-way through the movie. Doh! TO PIN: 4 RIVER STROKE 260 IN THE BOX EXTRAS! EXTRAS! READ ALL ABOUT 'EM! 3DO are also planning an impressive range of hardware add-ons, including a pair of virtual reality glasses which could scupper Sega's VR machine. Also lined up is a modem which will let you play games with your mates over the phone (and generate a bill so big your parents will kick you out of the house), and a MIDI interface so you can hook up music keyboards and the like to it. 3DO's technical specifications are very close to those of the CD32. It utilises a similar 32-bit RISC processor and graphics chip set which allows it to display the same number of colours as its Commodore rival. However, it also contains a set of custom chips which the 3DO company call Cinematic Software Tools. These are specifically designed to let the machine produce loads of weird effects, such as pasting sprites over 3D objects and rendering objects in 3D then warping them. The advantage of this is that the main processor SOFTWARE GALORE VERDICT When it comes to software the 3DO is more than well represented. Existing smash-hits such as Road Rash, PGA Tour Golf and John Madden's will be appearing alongside original titles like Star Trek: The Next Generation and an incredible interactive movie version of Jurassic Park. Plenty of educational discs are also in the pipeline, along with entertainment packages such as CPU Bach, which plays some of the composer's most famous pieces to your specifications. It doesn't stop there, though; big names such as Ocean, US Gold and Virgin also developing software for 3DO. While both machines are closely matched in technical terms, Commodore have gained a significant edge thanks to their machine's low price and by simply being on the shelves first. 3DO, on the other hand, has the power of some of the biggest guns in the entertainment world. Tie-ins with MCA and Time-Warner promise some incredible interactive movies. Until both machines have been on the shelves for a while it will be impossible to tell which, if either, has the upper hand. So don't call us asking \"Which is better?\" wait and see how they perform! PAUL RAND "


"32-BIT SATURN REVEALED! The rumours about the imminent arrival of the new breed of 32-bit consoles have been flying for some time but now Sega, ever on the ball, look set to turn these flights of fancy into reality with their new machine, the Saturn, which is already being billed as bigger and better than 3DO! Sega have already made their mark in the realm of 32-bit technology with arcade machines like Virtua Racing. Now they're trying to bring the phenomena into the home with the CD-based Saturn. Lucy Hickman reports... 2XALL Is this the future of home entertainment? Probably not, as this is just an artist's impression of what the Saturn could look like. We'll bring you more news as it comes in! UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT You've had the gen, now look at the hard facts the stats of the current Saturn prototype machine: WHAT'S IT GOT? According to an inside source at Sega of Japan, comparing the graphics capabilities of the Saturn to the new 3DO multimedia machine is like comparing 20 to 3D and if you look at this system's statistics, which read like a techno freak's dream, it could just be true. Imagine, if you will, a machine with a graphics chip so advanced that it is capable of producing 16.7 million colours through its 24-bit pixels. On the understanding that the Super Nintendo has a palette of only 32,000 colours and the Megadrive a paltry 65, that's a lorra lorra colours in anybody's book. Sega have sweated blood producing a custom-built 32-bit processor which is roughly based on the existing V60 NEC 32-bit chip but with a massively improved performance. Speed is going to play a big part in this baby the current prototype processor runs at 27 MHz and when you consider that the Megadrive only has a 7.61 MHz processor and the Super NES runs at only 3.58 MHz, we're talking fast! But even if the V60 only ran at 3.58 MHz, it would still process similar tasks a lot quicker because, the Saturn chip is inherently faster and it's a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Chip), which means that program code is simpler and quicker to execute. MICROPROCESSOR: Custom 32bit processor based on the NEC V60, with speed modifications by Sega and Hitachi to make it run at 27 MHz. nicked from Virtua Racing includes a highly advanced polygon generator chip which Sega have slapped into the Saturn. This chip can display and animate over 16,000 polygons on the screen at once! Eat your heart out Nintendo this baby makes the Super FX chip look like Playdo. Okay, so it all sounds hunky dory but don't start wetting your pants yet. It would appear that the Saturn won't even be out in Japan until the end of next year so God only knows when it'll be winaing its way across the ocean to Britain. On the pricing front, it looks like Saturn will hit the shelves for about $400 in America and in the UK we'd guess it'll cost around . Oh, and if all you Mega-CD owners are hoping for Saturn compatibility with your machines, tough. As the saying goes, no way José! GRAPHICS: Custom 24-bit processors with Alpha Channel effects. COLOURS: A massive palette of 16.7 million colours! IT'S GOT THE LOT! Due to something known as The Alpha Channel' apparently some sort of hardware graphics filter the Saturn can produce \"transparent\" colours (as seen in Super NES games), modified colour palettes and textured shading (as seen in Virtua Racing). Another feature, POLYGON GENERATOR: Capable of displaying and animating 16,000 polygons on-screen! 24 "

"When the BIG NAMES play games, they play 'em with CVG! ELEBRITY CHALLENGE with KLAN KECAN THE CHALLENGE VG's star-studded challenge series rumbles on into another month, and with the new footy season just underway, we've gone back onto the pitch as part of our Summer Soccer Spectacular. So, step forward newly-promoted Premier League manager Kevin Keegan to take part in the toughest CVG challenge yet... KEVIN KEEGAN'S DIARY OF A PLAYER MANAGER MONDAY JUL TH Randy hands over the Player Manager cart to an excited Keegster. The challenge is on! Former Liverpool and England superstar Kevin Keegan has just led his team Newcastle United into the top-flight Premier League. But could he repeat his legendary success as a team boss in one of the most accurate management games ever devised? We dispatched our resident Geordie Paul Rand to deliver the challenge to Kevin on his home turf of St James' Park, home of the Magpies. Kevin was given a week to take his computerised version of Newcastle Utd from the bottom of the league to top-of-the-table glory. No easy task, even for one of the game's top managers. But playing during close season, Kevin was able to put plenty of practice in. This is his personal diary of what happened... Glory glory Kevin Keegan... We thought we'd try something a bit different for the Challenge this month. Normally they're rather confrontational affairs based around two-player games, with a CVG staffer taking on a top famous bod. But seeing as how we keep getting stuffed by the celebs, we've gone for a Kev with the cart that will take over his life for the next seven days. Met my new squad for the first time today. Took a little time to go through them one by one and weigh up their statistics. A few promising players here, but quite a few carthorses, too. I'll put the lot of them on a gruelling training routine and see how they fare in a couple of pre-season friendlies. Then we should see the cream float to the top. I just let the lads out on the pitch for a friendly game against the computer. What a disaster! 4-0! We can't afford that kind of result when the season starts. If nothing else, I managed to isolate the shirkers, and I've let them know that I will no longer be requiring their services. If I can get a decent price for the three I'm getting rid of, there may be enough cash in the coffers to get a decent striker we're definitely looking weak up front. Gave our scout his instructions. «Get me a striker with plenty of stamina and a bit of that old razzle-dazzle.\" I've little hope of tempting Gazza back home, but there's plenty of talent out there waiting to be discovered. Let's see what happens. The Geordies' God, yesterday. bit of a change of pace. To tie in with Newcastle United manager Kevin Keegan's endorsement of Anco's new Player Manager game, we decided to find the answer to that age-old question... how good would a real football manager be at his own football management game? Let's see, shall we? "


"TUESDAY JULY 6TH FRIDAY JULY 9TH SATURDAY JULY 10TH I want no funny business lads, just silky skills and honest graft... EX It's not all fun, fun, fun! Had another good, hard look at the squad today before casting my eye over the transfer markets. Those three donkeys are already up for grabs, so we'll soon see if any other clubs are interested. I also had a look to see who was on sale, and a few names caught my eye, but there's nothing in my price range. I need to get results early so I can pack the fans in and get good gate receipts to boost my purchasing power. But how can I do that if I can't afford a reliable target man in the first place? It's a vicious circle that all managers have to break. Yesterday's practice game also threw up some sloppy midfield play, so I've rejigged our training schedule to suit. With any luck this should tighten us up a bit at the back so at least we won't concede as many. I'm fairly happy with the general make-up of my side at last, so I'm going to take the plunge and start the season proper tomorrow. I'll need to pack in as many games as I can in a day if I'm to finish in a decent league position by the challenge deadline on Sunday, and that might mean cutting corners. Gulp. The club's finances are looking good after yesterday's crowdpleasing results. I could afford another player, so I might go on the lookout for a midfielder. Otherwise I'm perfectly happy with the team, and I don't expect to make any changes to my line-up for today's matches. At this late stage I need consistent results — losses now will make it nigh-on impossible to finish well by the Sunday deadline. FULL-TIME We won four of the games we played today, drew two and lost one. We're in fourth place on 23 points, so things are really looking good. Two of our upcoming games are with teams above us in the table so, while they're bound to be strong opponents, each win would be a real six-pointer. Ooh, I'm excited! I've bought a new midfielder for a tidy sum — he actually cost less than my striker, but the cash is rolling in now so it's less of a strain on the old wallet. I've already got him in training with the rest of the lads, and I'll try him out in the games later today. If he can plug this annoying hole in midfield, it'll take the pressure off my back four and, theoretically, we should concede less goals. FULL-TIME In the five games played today, we let in only two goals. Best news of the day, though, was giving top-ofthe-table Aston Villa a good stuffing 4-1, which drops them down to third and, along with the rest of the results, shunts us into second place. I want to play more, but it's getting late and there's still a whole day to go. Time to call it a night. And to think I was worried! WEDNESDAY JULY 7TH THURSDAY JULY 8TH SUNDAY JULY 11TH \"What do you mean, I've ran out of time2\" Mind you, if the Keeg can get his team to third spot in a week, just think what he could do for real this season! The first game of the new season draws us against Sheffield United. I've studied their team and they look strong all round. I'm confident that our defence is solid, but I've still got a gaping hole up front. I'm throwing everything into a 4-3-3 formation and giving my forwards orders to shoot on sight. If I throw enough mud against the goal, maybe some of it will stick. FULL-TIME Success! As I predicted my defence held firm. My Number 6 produced an out-of-the-blue goal that took us to victory over the Blades, 1-0. As it turns out, the other results from around the country generally went our way, so after our first match we've gone from the relegation zone to a respectable 12th place. My scout may have found the striker I'm looking for. He doesn't come cheap, but I can just about scrape the cash together to sign him. We're going up against Tottenham, West Ham, Everton and Man City. None of them are easy, but I'm confident we can absorb the pressure. An early win does wonders for morale. FULL-TIME At the end of the day I'm pleased, The final day, and my star striker has picked up an ankle injury that will sideline him for the next three games. I've got to get that ball in the back of the net. with wins against West Ham (2-1) It's too late to be making fancy changes now. All I can do is put out the best and Man City (1-0). But we only team I know and hope for the best. drew against Spurs (2-2) and Everton took us to the cleaners, 3FULL-TIME 1. Seven points out of a possible I think I rushed things. I only played four games today, but managed to lose twelve is nothing to be sneezed at, two of them and draw the other two, which just about scuppers my though. I admit I made a mistake chances of scraping back to the top spot by the end of the day. Currently fiddling with our defence — the I'm in third place, but CVG is coming to pick up their Super NES later today. lesson for today is if it ain't broke, It's a shame, because I came so close. Maybe if I hide the SNES in the don't fix it. cupboard and tell them I lost it? Victory shall be mine... THE FINAL WHISTLE In the end, Kevin Keegan had to give us back the Super NES after specially-trained sniffer dogs found it hidden under the floorboards. Kev never quite made it to the top of the table, but any manager who can take a team from last place to third in the course of a week can't be doing badly. Maybe he should take it up professionally... CVG CELEBRITY CHALLENGE HALL OF FAME MAY: Nigel Benn SEPTEMBER: Kevin Keegan JUNE: Zig & Zag OCTOBER: JULY: Arsenal FC AUGUST: The Mitchell Brothers "

"REVIEW PC ENGINE by CAPCOM T.00 OUT: On import. Thanks to ACE Consoles (071 439 1185) for the review cartridge. The dragon punch is the best way to halt Balrog's leaping aerial attacks. A backbreaker is an especially damaging move in this version of the game, sapping more energy than ever. Balrog plants a big one right on Eddie Honda's head. SIX OF THE GREEN To get the best out of PC Engine Streetfighter 2 you'll need to change your joypad. You can now get hold of special six-button pads which have been launched to coincide with the release of the game. With a standard twobutton pad you can only access the heaviest or lightest punch and kick, which makes SF2 very difficult to play. With six buttons however, you get all the moves and, just like in the coin-op, the punches are on the top three buttons with the kicks on the bottom trio. FIGHED If you're going to get Streetfighter pads to go with it, otherwise your 2 you had better get one of these sad limited attacks will prevent you from completing the game CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION Sho-Ryu-Ken! The coin-op smash makes it to the little NEC wonder and how! he PC Engine is often the one console overlooked when it comes to the big name games but not this time. From seemingly out of nowhere comes Streetfighter 2, and it's the Championship Edition to boot! Somehow, Capcom have managed to cram an incredible 20 megs of WHATIS IT ALL data on a miniscule Engine cartridge and the results are stunning. All the backdrops, music and ABOUT THEN? sound effects from the coin-op are featured and it's highly unlikely that anyone it's fast, too! There are even six button joypads reading this doesn't know about Streetfighter 2, unless they belong available, which are practically essential for the to a tribe of Patagonian pygmies game. With all that, what more could you ask for? who've just taken out a subscription to Sad Man Monthly. The aim of the game is to simply prove how hard you are by beating up a er 12.NET dozen of the world's greatest fighters. Your fighter can be any one of the game's 12 stars, whose combative talents range from fire breathing to incredible jumping punches. In the original version of the game you could only play the first eight characters, but after it became the world-wide number one coin-op Capcom realised they could spin it for even more cash Better than any other move in the entire game is Zangief's spinning pildriver. While it's difby releasing an enhanced version ficult to execute, any opponent caught with one can expect to lose up to half their energy. the Championship Edition! Sagat's tiger uppercut is an almost complete rip-off of Ken and Ryu's dragon punch, although it's not as powerful. Vega's torpedo is effective if you follow it with a throw by hitting hard punch when you land next to your opponent. 30 "


"THE BOSSES AND HOW THEY WORK For the first time on a console well, until Nintendo release Turbo on the SNES you can play the final four characters. Here's a bit about them and, more importantly, how to execute their special moves. And no, we haven't got their names mixed up, this is what they're called in this version so yah-boo-sucks to you. BALROG M BISON Of all the characters in the game, Dhalsim is the slowest. He has no new moves and is easily stomped on by the likes of Vega, With lightning-fast moves, Balrog is the speediest character in the game. He also has a set of strapon claws just to make no bones about the fact he's hard. This mean boxer from Las Vegas has a devastating arsenal of punches, but no kicks, which leaves him vulnerable to aerial attacks. Rolling crystal flash: L/R/Punch Balrog spins across the ground, claws first. With a hard punch he can deliver six blows in quick succession. Dashing uppercut: L/R/Punch Bison slides across the screen to flatten his opponent with a sledgehammer punch. A slow fireball from Ken or Ryu will nearly always catch out high flying characters such as Chun-Li and Guile. Izna Drop: D/U/Kick This is Balrog's most devastating move. He leaps into the air and descends claws-first onto his hapless victim. Power punch: Hold all three punch buttons then release. A highpowered killer punch capable of draining lots of energy even when your opponent is blocking! VEGA SAGAT Undoubtedly the hardest character in the game, Vega has a uniform fetish and a vast array of completely awesome moves. Despite being deficient in the eye department, Sagat is one tough cookie. He's also very tall, which gives him an incredible reach. Torpedo: VR/Punch Vega flies across the screen, charged up with mystical energy or something. Not very damaging, but good for getting out of a tight spot. Tiger uppercut: R/D/DR/R/Punch Similar to Ryu and Ken's dragon punch, but with a greater reach. Vega's high jumping abilities and massive strength make him a formidable opponent. Especially if you master all of his smart special moves. Head press: D/U/PUNCH A giant leap ends up with Vega jumping onto the head of his victim then giving them a jolly good slapping as he lands. Tiger shot: D/D-R/R/Punch A high-powered fireball that travels at incredible speed. Knee press: L/R/Kick A stunning three-hit move which consists of a spinning jump and several kicks to the shins. me VERDICT This is a real turn up for the books! In terms of action, PC Engine Streetfighter 2 almost manages to match the SNES version blow for blow, and being the Championship Edition you can thrash the life out of anyone with the hardest characters! In fact I only have two niggles with the game; the music is a bit poor and slow and it's almost impossible to play the game with the standard two-button pad. Apart from those faults, and the slightly purple graphics, this is a fine a conversion as PC Engine owners could ask for. You cannot afford to miss it! O STEVE KEEN Ryu vs Ryu. With an even match like this the winner is usually the person who knows all the special moves. 31 "


"WELCOME TO BONUS STAGE PC ENGINE SF2 contains several bonus stages where the aim is to trash inanimate objects, thus proving how hard you are. The orig. inal game had three, although, probably for memory reasons, the Engine version only has the two. The oil-drum stage is the one that got away; however, we are still left with these two excellent examples of violence. Car smashing: Somebody's made the mistake of parking in the space designated 'Ace Streetfighters Only, and he doesn't even have a disabled permit. There's only one way to remedy this situation and that's to employ your amazing combat skills to destroy the offending vehicle. Blanka, Honda and Chun-Li are the best at this because of their special attacks. It looks dumb, but this is actually the headpress, one of Vega's special moves. It works best when the fighters are at opposite sides of the screen, PROS: All the characters, moves and effects of the arcade original. CONS: A six-button joypad is pretty much essential if you don't want to play like a donkey. GRAPHICS A bit on the purple side, but they're large and very well animated Because of his awesome uppercut, Sagat is quite capable of blatting Vega out of the air every time he tries something flashy. Barrel bashing: Wooden barrels fall from the ceiling and all you have to do is smash them. If they land, chances are they'll flatten you and roll off the screen, so you won't get a perfect score. ONNOS All the tunes are there, but they sound slow and a bit iffy in places. LAMA 92000. MESEP 00 GAMEPLAY It's Streetfighter 2! What more can we say? Bison's power punch is capable of draining a large lump of energy even if the recepient is blocking Having the four end characters to control extends the game's longevity. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES The best characters for this stage are Ryu, Ken and Guile because of their strength, speed and excellent high kicks. VERDICT ONWON IIIIIIIIII The dashing upper-cut is a good move when it works, but all it takes is a low kick to thwart this devastating attack. MISS OK HIT They said it wasn't possible. What were they talking about? Streetfighter 2 on the Engine, of course. As you can see, it's perfectly possible, and pretty brilliant as well. I do agree with Stevie on his two niggles; the music is not much cop and irritatingly slow, and the six-button joypad is really indispensible when playing, so be prepared to shell out for one when you by the cartridge. The best thing about Streetfighter 2 is that it's going to be so popular that surely NEC will consider launching it in the UK and a big boo hiss to them if they don't. PAUL ANGLIN Balrog's Izna drop is a very good move, especially if your opponent is jumping at the time. In this situation Blarog puts away! his claws and executes an incredible midair piledriver. 32 "

"SNES by CAPCOM .00 OUT: On import. Thanks to ACE Consoles (071 439 1185) for the cartridge. THEY'RE BACK! AND THIS TIME, RYU, BLANKA AND THE REST ARE TAKING NO PRISONERS! IT==  : TYPER FIGHTING ME Think back to that golden Streetfighter Il era, when every magazine, school playground and arcade was overflowing with SF2 gossip and debates on hot tactics and SF2 shenanigans. As the months rolled by and players had perfected all the characters, attentions turned to the mysterious bosses. Wouldn't it be great if we could play them? Despite all the bleating from other mags and hundreds of phone calls, CVG stood its ground and proclaimed that, with the existing cart, this was impossible and we were right! But now, at long last, those infamous bad boys are within your grasp with SF2 Turbo and with them comes a whole lot more! SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE The two Spaniards fence it out. Flaming fury! Vega toasts another sap. VERDICT As the very name suggests, Streetfighter Il Turbo Hyperfighting's all about speed and the characters now all move at a blistering pace. There's hardly any time to blink on the highest Turbo setting and although the characters don't put out as much damage, the bouts are decided fast! Graphics have also been brushed up and the colours are a lot brighter and bolder, although the character selection icons are a bit cack! There's more sampled speech too, with cheers and crowd noises being added to the usual combat cries. Make no mistake; this is a massive 20 Megabit cartridge, and the whole caboodle is completely shoe-horned in like a tin of giant mutant sardines; in other words, it's big. 34 This is a dream come true! The new graphics, colours, sampled speech and sound effects put the icing on the cake to the greatest game in history! Capcom's cunning decision to add special moves to the usual characters and revamp their performances is a master stroke; the cart feels like a totally new game! Surprisingly, controlling the bosses is a letdown none are as deadly under your control as they were in SF2. Importers will have a field day with this; if you've got SF2, find someone who'll buy it and grab the sequel it's massive! STEVE KEEN Smack that big boy back to the jungle! "


"ART FOR ARTS SAKE! He's big! He's bad! He's, erm, big. He's E Honda! Karate's Ryu's bag. He's studied the art to perfection under the same master as ken. Although they have the same moves Ryu's feel slightly more sluggish than his American buddy's. Dragon Punch Lift opponents clear off the mat with the most powerful move in the arena! Hurricane Kick Batter skulls and break balls with the whirling warrior's ultimate kicking force. Fireball Ryu's most useful move. The awesome rush of flames has saved his skinny white ass more times than he cares to remember! The gutsy American fancies himself a bit and is a hit with the ladies. This often gets in the way of his fighting and his erratic nature makes him lose concentration and make stupid mistakes. Dragon Punch His most awesome form of self expression. Total carnage!

Fireball Let loose any one of three speeding balls of fire to fox and burn opponents into submission. with his own special brand of the Queensbury Rules.

Inza Drop Bounce up over your victim's head and drop down from above, knives at the ready to dice his flesh! Spanish Crunch Grab the opponent and smash his back and head into the canvas with crippling results. Spanish Crunch Inza Drop Despite what other mags say, you can not control the bosses in Streetfighter 2 with any cheat cartridge known to man. It's quite simple, the code just does not exist inside the cartridge to do it. The only way you can get your mitts on the juicy Jap final four is with this new cart. But that's not all! Turbo even has the edge over the arcade Championship Edition in that it packs some incredible new features. Just about every character has been adjusted to give you an even more rounded scrap than before. Hopeless fops have been given even more special moves and rock hard geezers have been tweaked to perfection. Overall the game has been made a touch harder with not so much energy dropping off when you get hit and now you've really got to pile on in if you want to stun a world warrior.

"GET IN THE THICK OF IT! Think you can play the bosses then, do you? Well, you might not want to, after all. The thing about Streetfighter Il Turbo is that, not only has the game's appearance been shunted one up the ladder, but the original characters' skills have been improved upon as well. Here's what the awesome bunch are capable of these days: HONDA Wow! The tummy ton terror's got a new bottom flop. He jumps up in the air and thunders down, flaps a-wobbling! Eddy can also move towards opponents whilst doing the Hundred Hand Slap for a real pasting! RYU AND KEN Their super-fast Hurricane Kicks have been improved by making them executable at a higher height. Ouch! That hurt! You can't do this in the original! KO BLANKA CHUN The lovely lady now has a colour coordinated fireball to play with. Her excellent Spinning Bird Kick is also at a deadly new height, too! The green-skinned monster can perform his rolling attacks vertically to come down from above as well as horizontal ly now. ZANGIEF Zangief's been jazzed up a bit and his new Super Lariat is unescapable. If you get within his reach you'll have to stay and suffer the consequences! THERE'S SO MUCH INI It's about now that Megadrive fans across the globe start putting guns to their heads and pull the trigger. Why? 'Cos not only have Nintendo beaten the Sega boys to the finishing post with Streetfighter 2, but they've completely quashed their fumbling efforts to get out the Megadrive Championship Edition by going even further with Turbo Hyperfighting! So what's the difference? Well, everyone knows you can play the bosses now, but with Turbo you can play the same characters head to head, change the speed at which they fight around the screen, notch up the difficulty level to new heights and mess around with a whole host of other fine and dandy options. DHALSIM Reverse crucifix? I'd give him a 9.9! As everyone knows, Dhalsim was a bit hopeless in the air and was easily trapped in corners. Now, with his new teleportation tactics, he can vanish from the screen to reappear somewhere else. ON THE OTHER HAND   TUFF E NUFF : .99 VERDICT Just one of many clones, but certainly the best alternative to Streetfighter 2 at the moment. Great graphics, characters and moves. Not quite as playable, but definitely in the same league. (89 REVIEWED: CVG No 139, We've been getting hot and sweaty about SF2 Turbo for ages now and luckily it looks as though it was all worth it. Ryu and the boys are back in real style, and with new coloured clothes. As great as the original was, it always lacked a tiny bit of that special something to make it earth shattering, but the Turbo edition has buckets of that magic stuff. The extra moves and the added colours and the extra speech and the added speed and and and argggh! My head's exploded! Buy it now, now now nowwwww!

"VERDICT SNES ER Famicom SIBERIALES Hiya! Am I the only one who can spot the glaring faults in this game? If you have the first game there's no point in buying this, as the two are almost identical. Secondly, the prices the importers are asking for this cart are extortionate. If you really have to buy SF Turbo, wait for the official release, you'll save yourself a fortune and the text will be in English. On the other hand, if you don't have the first game, this should be at the top of your must-buy list when it's launched here. In the meantime, cross your legs and wait. PROS: New moves and more speed. Totally customisable and you can even turn it into the normal SF2! CONS: The bosses aren't the same as they used to be. They've been tamed by having less powerful specials and given weedier moves. PAUL RAND GRAPHICS Great new bright colours and character outfits Look out! It's flying Honda! That must have smarted.

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE by SEGA .99 OUT: September. Thanks to Sega (071 373 3000) for the review cartridge. He's big, but underneath he's a real pussy! Bodies bodies everywhere, but not a jot to drink. DAMER BIG GUNS! Don't move, if you know what's good for you. GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT Gunstar Heroes is a bit more customisable than most games in this genre, and a great deal more interesting. At the start of the game you'll get to choose the style of fire you want to blanket out. There's a choice of Fixed, which lets you fire in all eight directions but doesn't allow you to run, and Free, which lets you move whilst you fire. You also get a choice of initial weapon and it's advisable to pick the Chaser gun as soon as possible as it splits up its stream of fire and homes in on the nearest enemies. And just to make sure you get an even break at the beginning you can even choose which stage you want to begin on from four rock hard levels. A robot Linford Christie? I think not! GUNSTAR HEROES Our boys only have room to carry two weapons and start with just one. Having said that, they can alternate between the two they carry at any time; the problem is finding them. If you're fortunate enough to discover a free pickup, count your lucky stars because to be rewarded with more guns you usually have to kill something! Shoot everything you see, including background objects. If they flash the chances are they're hiding something, so blow them to smithereens and collect your reward. The only icon worth more than a weapon power-up is the heart. This replenishes your validity counter and your health, so if you have to make a speedy choice as to what to take go for this every time or you'll be out of the game and sent right back to the start! weapon and it's advisable to pick Guns, blasting and laughs ahoy in one of the best Sega shoot 'em ups for a long time! e're used to seeing weird and wonderful things from Japan, but Gunstar Heroes on Megadrive is something else! 'Oh yeah! you cry, 'Looks like any old platform shoot 'em up to me! But oh, how wrong you are! You see, in the wacky world of the fevered Japanese programmer's brain anything can happen and in Gunstar Heroes it generally does! The idea's to fight through level after level of crazy death-filled action and collect the power crystals before the evil Captain Orange gets to them. Now prepare yourself for a serious ride! Hit him where it hurts. STAGE BY STAGE There are four immediate stages to the whole game and, although it doesn't sound like many, it's not going to be an easy Jump on to your retro-scooter, bring back the host's missing brother by negotiating the underground mines, trains and guard filled carts and flatten the massive twisting guardians. This is the master's base. Blast though the techno levels and try to get onto the board in one piece! The ancient ruins, covered by jungle foliage and swamped with imperial guards. Find the mystic gem near the pink mining machine and take it to the next level.

An absolute monster of a purchase. NO ODHITTON STEVE KEEN Watch your step or you could lose your head. 39 "


"VERDICT MEGADRIVE Gunstar Heroes has everything! Platform action, fighting, shoot 'em up stages and more special effects than a Spielburg movie. My particular favourite was Black's board game, which is one of the most original features I've seen for a long time. One word of advice; don't play this game on Easy mode. You'll finish it in no time at all, which would be a crying shame as this game contains sooo much excellent stuff. There's no way on Earth you could become bored of Gunstar. What more is there to say about the game, other than buy it? In space, no-one can hear you burn! PROS: Highly original and entertaining arcade masterpiece! The gameplay is incredi bly fast with more sprites biting the dust than bees in a hive. CONS: Much too fast and complicated to play with two players. The screen gets much too cluttered and both sprites look the same. PAUL ANGLIN Even when you're facing the opposite direction you can dish it out. ON THE OTHER HAND GET BUSY! We've all got our own favourite styles of play, so here's a list our personal choices of weapons, all of which can be powered up by collecting icons: Awesome explosions and brilliant metamorphosing guardians. RANGER X GRAPHICS Although very similar Ranger X has the edge due to its harder techno image. Ranger X is Cybernator for the Megadrive and although the robot suited hero is nothing like the Stars the basic shoot 'em up theme remains true with tons of weapons. ONDOS Realistic effects and good dynamic noises. REVIEWED: CVG No 142 FORCE Garth's best weapon. The Force seeks out the central point of the nearest object you aim at and directs your fire towards that point constantly until you take your finger off the trigger. A bit like Garth when he's trying to make a point! GAMEPLAY Fast and furious relentless arcade action! LIGHTNING Paul Anglin loves this one because, like him, it never strikes in the same place twice! Lightning shoots at enemies and passes through them to the next object. @ Addictive and un-putdownable! Buy it! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 3 CHASER Produces a stream of green bullets that homes in on enemies. If there is more than one attacker the stream will split and spread itself between them. This is Steve Keen's all-time fave because it reminds him of himself once he's scoped a babe he never gives up until he's hit the target! Nice ships make nice tips! Just use the WEIRDER AND chaser. WEIRDER Probably one of the hardest sections in the game is the giant playing board that's thrown up to hinder the Stars' advances. The playing surface is made up of 18 squares, each hiding a devilish problem or obstacle for you to negotiate. By literally picking up a huge dice and tossing it you have to advance to the exit at the bottom of the Avoid the hurly-burly and blast! screen. Each square hides a different challenge, ranging from cunning mazes populated by bone-frying balls of plasma, finger-numbing obstacle courses to massive guardians and a miniature guard who jumps onto you like a limpet and tosses you all over the place! Get to the other side and land on the penultimate square and it's right back to the beginning again. Land on the last square and you'll have to face off with the huge end-of-level-boss! There are only two helpful squares on the board which are the pick-up rooms; loaded with goodies, these are vital if you want to survive the board game, but you'll have to land on them first! They can sneer, but you've got the upper hand. NWUOVO TUTTITUT MISS OK.HIT FIRE Ejects huge balls of flame to roast enemies close by.

"MEGADRIVE by KONAMI .99 OUT: Now. Contact Konami (081 429 2446) for information. LRES JASS. ROCKET KNIGHT ADVENTURES Konami brings you the world's first rocketpowered opossum! Up, up and away! he animal kingdom has been more than fairly represented in Megadrive games, with hedgehogs, foxes, dogs and insects all making an appearance. Now things are getting really stupid the star of Rocket Knight Adventures is an opossum called Sparkster! Don't be mistaken, though. This isn't the kind of cuddly opossum which is quite content to spend its days munching on insects; this one has a sword and a rather large rocket pack strapped to its back, making it the hardest rodent ever. HAM 'N EGGS Sparkster is on a mission to free his world from the clutches of an evi! overlord called Axle Gear and resI wasn't expecting anything from this game, which probably explains cue the local princess from him in why I was so surprised by it. At first it seems like a standard scrolling the process. Why a small, treearcade adventure, but as you get into it you dwelling mammal would undertake realise just how much gameplay it contains. such a quest is unclear, but The levels are huge and there's always seeing as the planet is something to do, be it battering pigs or trying almost entirely populatto work out how to get Sparkster past a pared by killer pigs it's ticularly large hazard. Combined with the not quite as strange excellent graphics, varied action and the as it first seems. Sparkster is armed originality of the character, this is one of the with a nifty sword better games to grace the Megadrive in '93. which, quite apart from being dangerously sharp, also fires deadly PAUL ANGLIN energy bolts. VERDICT 42 "


"7-UP VERDICT level is size. Each one seems to go on for ages, through many different backgrounds and features. One particularly tricky stage has you guiding Sparkster from platform to platform by looking at his reflection in a pool of lava. Between Sparkster and Axle Gear are seven danger-packed levels. Starting in the relatively safe forest, Sparkster has to survive the perils of the mountains and the caves beneath them. Should he come through unscathed the next step is to journey into deep space aboard Axle's giant battleship, then finally confront the evil one on his home world, the Pig Planet. Between levels you're updated on the plot, with cut scenes showing what devious dealings Gear's up to. One feature common to each Well, this game has certainly snuck up on us! It's not often you see graphics of this quality on the Megadrive I mean, they are huge! Anyone who's seen the amazing Super Ghouls 'N' Ghosts on SNES will know just what to expect, 'cos the backdrops and platforms in the first level are almost identical. The lad Sparkster has a bit of a mean line of fire, but it's not until he lets loose with his amazing rocket-powered jet pack that this game takes off! Action, baddies, explosions and huge cartoon characters are relentless and the differing styles of gameplay (platform and horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up) make for a corker of a ride through the levels. It looks great and plays like a dream we love it! GARTH SUMPTER THRUSTING ACTION Sparkster's rocket pack lets him blast himself toward aliens at several times the speed of sound. This causes them massive amounts of damage while getting Sparkster from A to B in a very small amount of time. All you have to do to activate it is hold the attack button then press the joypad in the required direction. Spinning sword attack: Sparkster sticks out his sword, kicks in his rocket and rotates at high speed. The result is a deadly move which slices and dices any pig who gets too close. AQUATIC ACTIVITIES Quite apart form the standard scrolling stages which make up the bulk of Rocket Knight's action, there are also a couple of variations on the theme. Sparkster occasionally employs his rocket pack to power him through horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up sections; here, the onus is completely on action with the object being simply to blast everything that appears. There are also a number of underwater stages, which are generally slower than the platform and blasting levels, and as a result are tedious by comparison 29=CC Side rocket: Charge! Sparkster puts his head down then blasts across the screen at high speed, skewering everything that gets in his way. Leaping attack: Similar to the side attack, only this time Sparkster goes up, up and away, only unlike Superman he lands in a sad heap. SWORD PLAY RESTO9-CODE xOMODO. STOGOSTER VALLS PIG IN A POKE Axle Gear's warriors have been busy coming up with all sorts of crazy devices to thwart Sparkster's mission. These include giant Star Wars AT-ST ripoffs which are easily destroyed, steam-powered jeeps which aren't any better and giant robots which look like they were cobbled together on a wet weekend. Like the bosses, most of the vehicles have to be hit in a specific area to be destroyed; as to where that area is, trial and error is the only way to find out. As you approach the Pig Planet where Axle hangs out, the bosses take on an altogether more ferocious tone. These usually take a lot more hits to kill and cause much more damage than their predecessors. For a small rodent, Sparkster is actually a very hard character. His sword attacks cause vast amounts of damage and are often more useful than using the rocket pack. For some bosses such as the train, the best tactic is to get in close, then turn on the autofire, or start smacking the attack button as quickly as possible. Most bosses won't drain Sparkster's energy when he touches them, and often when he's very close to them they can't actually attack him. This tactic usually works, but if you get the timing wrong you'll find Sparkster coming to a very short, sharp end, or getting pushed out of the way. yalar 43 "


"IROCKET KNIGHT MEGADRIVE ADVENTURES TRAIN KEPT ROLLING The first truly tricky boss you encounter is the underground train. Unlike everything you encounter beforehand, this guardian has to be destroyed three times. BEAM ME UP SCOTTY When Sparkster has finished on the planet, he switches his rocket pack into overdrive and heads off into space. Here he faces a whole new threat from Gear's elite space troopers. Once more he enters a shoot 'em up section, although this time he comes under more fire than ever and you'll spend more time dodging than actually shooting. Should he survive all this, he finally arrives at Gear's homeworld. The final showdown between Sparkster and Axle Gear is a real test of your game-playing skill, and you'll probably find yourself annihilated within a few seconds. PROS:Big levels, decent graphics and plenty of action. CONS:Some of the boss stages drag on for too long. Up! Up! And away! GRAPHICS Colourful, with some very smart large objects. Happy, boppy tunes which can be a little irritating. Stage 1: The train rolls on from the left of the screen. Blast over to it then whack the fire button to slice its gun up with your sword. Rocket Knight takes on the big dragon! Will he survive? Find out next week! GAMEPLAY Easy to play and extremely challenging CO. The levels are massive, often containing two bosses. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Stage 2: This time the hands are the weak spot. Wait for them to grab at Sparkster then use the spinning attack to slice them up. THESE TEME 10 Ilike driving in my, erm, walker. VERDICT ONWA0000 111lllllll There's nothing better than a game that pops up almost totally unannounced and turns out to be a real cracker. And Rocket Knight Adventures is just such a game! There's so many reasons why this 'un's a winner; the graphics are excellent both sprites and backdrops, sound is a winner; gameplay is second to very few Megadrive cartridges around of late. This is a very stylish package, stuffed to the gunnels with varying kinds of game platform, shoot 'em up, the fun seldom stops. You might be of the opinion that when you've seen one blaster, you've seen them all. But when games like Rocket Knight Adventures come along, you're pleasantly surprised to find that there's life in the old genres yet. Nice one! MISSIOK HIT Stage 3: Finally the train attacks from the right of the screen. Again, get in close, but instead of the sword, use the spinning attack to finish it off. PAUL RAND "

"TIREVIEW PC/CD-ROM by LUCASARTS/US GOLD OUT: Now. Contact US Gold (021 625 3366) for information. PC:.99 CD-ROM:.99 Sunt down ACRES Of cherry trees in my days Laverne is stuck in a tree, so Hoagie must cut it down. George Washington hates cherry trees... The Secret of Monkey Island was the best adventure ever. But look out — there's a new boy in town! ...but this is a kumquat tree, so to fool old George you have to paint it red. ad professor Doctor Fred Edison has been causing chaos again. Not content with creating two weird tentacle creatures, he's also managed to invent a machine entirely devoted to flooding the rivers with toxic waste. The problems start when Purple Tentacle drinks the toxic sludge and mutates into an evil supergenius who wants to take over the world. Big problem! Especially when the only people who can stop him are nerdy computer boffin Bernard, twitchy medical student Laverne and fat heavy metal roadie Hoagie. It looks like humanity is doomed, then. Gumph! Sure enough, the axe-happy president agrees to give the tree the chop. You get a buzz from playlng! door 200 years later, the problem tree vanishes and Laverne comes down to earth with a bump. 46 "


"PUZZLING BEHAVIOUR VERDICT PC/CD-ROM Half the fun of a game like this is knowing what weird and wonderful objects are needed to solve a puzzle. And believe me, nothing is ever straightforward in Day Of The Tentacle. Like, how on earth do you get that fake vomit off the ceiling? And why the hell would you want a pair of horse's dentures? Sure, it's all completely insane, but who needs reality? I found Day Of The Tentacle easier than Monkey Island don't expect it to be a doddle, though. However long you take to complete it, you know you're going to be well and truly entertained. The best thing about this game is the look it's like one great big interactive cartoon! If you thought Monkey Island looked good, this is even better. And it walks all over cartoony games like Space Ace because it not only looks amazing, it's terrific fun, too. Go out and buy it now. PROS: The best adventure game ever. Graphics, sound and puzzles are all first rate. CONS: Like any adventure, it won't keep you entertained forever. Other than that, it's pretty much perfect. GARTH SUMPTER ON THE OTHER HAND THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND 2 PIRATES SPIT SPITE Brilliant graphics and fiendish puzzles feature in this crazy tale of pirates, treasure and three-headed monkeys. The ending is disappointing, but otherwise it's a great game that deserves a place in anyone's collection. GRAPHICS Completely brilliant. It's like watching a cartoon, only more fun. Loony laffs abound in this cracking game! REVIEWED: CVG 126 INOOS Catchy tunes, awesome sound effects and, on CD-ROM, wall-towall speech. RUBIER Loka+ PUR SHELL Bernard hates clowns, especially when they hit back. GAMEPLAY Loads of completely insane puzzles and plenty of laughs thrown in. SON OF A MANIAC Being flushed through time in a customised toilet is not my idea of first class travel. You'll tear your hair out at times. Oh, all righ?! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Day Of The Tentacle is the sequel to Maniac Mansion, which appeared on PC and Commodore 64 five years ago. The story is once again set in the mansion home of the crazy Edison family. Aside from Doctor Fred, there's Nurse Edna, an ugly old crone with a taste for younger men, and Weird Ed Edison, a paramilitary nut who's been undergoing therapy to calm him down. Laverne needs that food voucher, and to get it she must win the human show. But where's she going to find a willing human? illllllllli ONWULIMIT VERDICT VERY LAVATORIAL! MISS OK HIT I never thought I'd see a better adventure than Secret of Monkey Island 2, but I was wrong. This game is so impressive that whenever I played it I got an audience, and it wasn't long before everyone wanted a go. The cartoon style graphics are brilliant and there are lots of hilarious animation sequences to keep you entertained. The puzzles are pretty wacky, so you need to use your loaf, but you'll have a lot of fun in the process. This game is so good I'd sell my grandmother's crutches to pay for it. Hell, I'd even sell my granny. At the start you can only control Bernard, but as things progress you gain control of Laverne and Hoagie, too. But how do you swap inventory items with a character who's 200 years away from you? Simple. Each kid has his or her own time machine a customised toilet known as a ChronO-John. All you have to do is put the item down the toilet and flush it through time. PAUL ANGLIN 47 "


"REVIEW SNES by INFOGRAMES .99 OUT: September. Contact Infogrames (071 738 8199) for information. France's hysterical historical hero returns to computer screens again in this latest Super NES version. Does the midget marvel cut the mustard? s it just us, or are French cartoons really dull? Actually it's probably not just us, because that other French one, Tin-Tin, is crap as well. I mean, prancing about with Captain Haddock and those two blokes in bowler hats. What's funny about that? And what's funny about a pint-size frog geezer with a stupid moustache beating up Roman soldiers in the year 50BC? Nothing, that's what. But no matter. Whether Asterix is funny or not (and he isn't), you can't deny that he's had his fair share of video game stardom over the years. Like the films and comics, though, most of the games have been cack; now it all comes down to French firm Infogrames to deliver the goods where others have failed. ASTERI Among the snowy wastes of Helvetica. Climb, climb, climb! VERDICT GOING UNDERGROUND Just like in Mario (are you trying to make a point here? Ed), Asterix occasionally has to explore eerie underground caverns. Down here where the air is damp and it's all a bit creepy, the gameplay takes on a more maze-like feel, where it's harder to find your way through the rocky labryrinth you have to climb ropes to reach some high-up places for a start. But never fear, there are plenty of handy signposts dotted around to help even the most wayward adventurer. Oh, and watch out for the moving spikes and stuff. DOWN, SHEP! Every now and again, Asterix will burst open a brick that releases a little bone. This is a bit good, because it summons Asterix's pet pooch Dogmatix, who runs on and ravages the baddies on-screen. Huzzah! Unfortunately, these pickups are few and far between, so use them wisely. The coins, the baddies, the general feel of the platform action... it's all very reminiscent of that Brooklyn plumber and his kerrazy adventures. So, we've decided that Asterix is a bit of a Mario con, but does that make it a bad game? Well, provided you're willing to tolerate the obvious lack of originality, no. Sure, we've seen it all before, but it's not often a platform game comes along that looks, sounds and feels as good as this. Asterix fan or not, if you appreciate a top platform romp, you could do a lot lot worse than grab this little number. PAUL ANGLIN 48 "


"VERDICT ER NO, NOT SNES on ramicon Infogrames' SNES version of the little Gaul's adventures is, let's face it, a total rip-off of the Mario series, with the odd tweak here and there. But what platform game isn't, these days? The most important thing is whether it's playable, and Asterix is, for a while at least. Sprites and backdrops are impressive, and the game is enjoyable enough to keep you playing for some time. If you can stand to fork out another forty-five sovs for another Mario clone, then you should be happy enough with Asterix. Each level is divided into five short Acts in each one, you've got to guide Asterix past the numerous dangers to the exit. Primary perils come in the form of deadly drops off the bottom of the screen, which kill you instantly but can be avoided by using the controller to scroll the screen around Asterix without moving him, so if you're unsure as to what lies at the bottom of an abyss, you can slide the display down to take a look. Other than that it's the usual array of footsoldiers, flying fiends and wild boars that cause Asterix most of his grief. PROS: Good graphics and solid, addictive gameplay. CONS: Almost completely unoriginal. GARY WHITTA GRAPHICS Cool, clean and chunky just like Mario! WHAT'S A SESTERCE? A sesterce is a fancy name for a shiny gem, of which there are absolutely squillions in the game. They can be found on the ground, up trees, down holes, etc etc, and if Asterix collects a cool hundred of these, the counter resets and he gets an extra life. Just like in Mario, in fact. But these orange baubles are only some of the many objects Asterix can grab to make his life easier. Hearts and food items increase our hero's energy (he loses a point each time he gets hurt), musical instruments can be used to stun enemies and coloured cauldrons have a variety of effects when the potion inside is drunk, from limited invincibility to the ability to fly! INNOS Plenty of top tunes and FX to jolly along the action. Down in the mystic caverns. IT'S A PLATFORM GAMEPLAY It looks good, feels good and by golly, it does you good! Well, what did you expect? Asterix: The Flight Simulator? In his latest outing, the lovable Gaul has been sent to rescue Obelix, who's been kidnapped by a Roman patrol. To get to him, Asterix has to cross the Roman-occupied land of Gaul, avoiding Caesar's traps and footsoldiers along the way. Asterix is an athletic fellow, and can run and jump just like, erm, Mario, but also packs a nifty punch with which he can see off most baddies. Simple, eh?

"OUT: Now. Contact Ocean (061832 6633) for more information LREVIEWSY OCEAN829,99 ONE STEP BEYOND PROS: Loads and loads of levels interspersed with some nice static screens. CONS: The gameplay is very linear, not to mention extremely easy. You re stuck! You have 17 tokens Watch out Colin Curly's Use Token Restart Puzzle Quit SOIHd 189 Not much to look at during the levels, but some of the still screens are excellent. Go on, be a devil and use a token! ONNOS SANTO Plodding tune and the occasional sampled sound don't do much. 00:242 Poor Colin's a bit stuck. GAMEPLAY It's easy to get into once you can remember how the various platforms work. PLATFORM HELL t seems that licence The majority of the platforms you'll fever has left Ocean encounter simply disappear when well and truly deliri Colin jumps off of them, but there ous, as they've now are some special ones which are real spanners in the puzzle-solving bought the rights to works. These babies do such jolly Quavers! While this things as cause all the other platsounds like a recipe for a forms to reappear, thus undoing all boring snack-related your good work, catapult Colin to game, Ocean have opted another part of the screen or even award him an extra life. As there's to revitalise Colin Curly, only one route through each stage the jolly Quaver-crunch all it takes is one false move by our ing character who graces Col to make a complete hash of the TV ads. It seems that the entire level. Colin was uplate playing Here's what everything does! Push Over (Ocean's previous Quavers game which had nothing to do with the crisps) when he was zapped by a strange beam and sucked into his computer. And guess what? Only you can help him escape. Easy to go through, and ultimately boring. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES DAT OSZONTEL POSIONEL TUS MADNESS For some reason Colin's computer contains thousands of tiny ledges which the canine hero has to traverse in order to escape. The catch is that each one disappears when Colin jumps off of it, and that the doorway to the next area only opens when all the platforms have gone. This is where the puzzle solving comes in. You have to guide Colin to the exit, getting rid of all the platforms on the way. One false move will leave the curly one stranded without any hope of escape other than you hitting the restart level button. Being a dog in a zoot suit, Colin isn't the most athletic of characters and the only moves he can muster are a few jumps. While these are enough to take him through each level, it also means you have to take this into consideration when planning his route. 104 OOO VERDICT  ONWAU MISS OK! HIT What I don't understand is, why go to all the time and expense of licensing a character for this title when the actual product hardly gets a look in? Colin Curly hardly ranks alongside Mickey Mouse and there isn't really much need for him or Quavers in the game. One Step Beyond lacks a serious challenge, and experienced puzzle game nuts will probably go through this like a dose of Sennapods through an old man. This makes it a good game for beginners, but it won't cut the mustard with anyone else. 23 Quavers PAUL ANGLIN ORIGINAL CHEESE FLAVOUR CURLY POTATO SHACK 51 "

"by INFOCOM I .99 OUT: On import. Contact Console Plus (0532 500 445) for info. .99 || SNES ER Famicom REVIEW by INFOCOM NIGEL MANSELL HI CHALLENGE MEXICO HERMANOS RODRIGUEZ LAP GISTANCE 421 PROS: Novel training mode and customising section. 19.231 30.95 CONS: Probably the worst road-handling of any driving simulation. ith Nigel Mansell, or \"Our Nige' as we patriotic Brits like to call him, reaping the benefits of driving for Paul Newman's Indy team in the States and his Formula One world championship title soon to be claimed by Frenchman Alain Prost, it seems that this game has missed the boat somewhat. Originally programmed for the Amiga by Gremlin, the game first appeared last year. Since then it's undergone a revamp by Japanese softco Infocom, who have made a few gameplay changes, most of which are for the worse, and unleashed it on a SNES market seriously starved of good driving games. Some tracks are far easier than others, with fewer turns and long straights. AND THEY'RE OFF! GRAPHICS Bland track but the car sprites aren't that bad. TE PEP man PUSE Before each race your car needs to be configured to suit the track and conditions. The right combination will make the race significantly easier. Buzzing engine, but good stereo effect when you pass cars. GEAR RATIO: The higher the ratio the more revolutions you get out of the engine. This means that a high ratio gives you a good top speed, while a low one is best for fast acceleration. Overtaking on corners is usually very dangerous, but this isn't real so if you crash you can just floor the accelerator and continue Hard, soft or wet, sir? And how about some tyres? GAMEPLAY The car handling ruins any chance of playability GRID POSITIU TYRES: Soft, hard or wets. Hard tyres are best for hot weather as they don't melt all over the road, while 'wets' are best for when it's bucketing down at Silverstone. SSANZUKI A lower price tag wouldn't justify the crud on this cartridge AULA No matter where you start on the grid, it's always possible to make up several places in the first few seconds. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES SPOILER: The height determines the road handling of your car. The higher it is the faster you'll go, it's just that your already nearuncontrollable car becomes impossible to drive. CRASH AND BURN The car in front belongs to Nigel. Hell tell you what speed to take corners at, although if you listen to him you'll probably end up crashing. ILL VERDICT ONWro v 110 MISS OK! HIT Formula One is an extremely dangerous sport one false move and you'll be on the last train to Crash Central. Fortunately, these hazards aren't recreated exactly in Nigel Mansell's as your car is made out of stronger stuff, being able to withstand head on collisions without any harm coming to the driver. Four black circles under the speedometer gradually disappear as you ram your car into the other drivers or road-side objects, inflicting damage on the vehicle. When there's only one left your pit crew radios al message for you to take a pit stop. Here they change your tyres, which instantly repairs the damage inflicted on your car. The original Nigel Mansell was hardly the best thing ever seen on the Amiga, but Infocom has made this version worse. Its biggest failing is the appalling road-handling it's as though the track has been greased. You car slides from side to side like it's on an ice-rink, and the only way to take sharp corners is in first gear. This is in fact so bad that it's almost impossible to follow Nigel's car on the training levels, and that's where it tells you how fast to take corners! The SNES has more than its fair share of driving turkeys, with this one joining that dubious collection. 39 PAUL RAND 53 "


"FIREVIEW MEGADRIVE by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 OUT: August. Contact Sega (071 373 3000) for information GOLDEN Frolics in the forest with large weapons. Check out the sequel to the sequel to the conversion of one of Sega's arcade greats! It's the Ultimate Warrior! It seems like only yesterday that Golden Axe was tearing up the arcades, and now we're already onto the third adaptation. Have the mythological adventures of the Golden crew lost their appeal or can we take even more hack 'n' slash beasty action? Sega seem to think we can as it wheels out what could quite possibly prove to be the last game in this popular series. CUT BACKS the sidelines and order everyone around. In his place are Chronos If you've managed to catch the Evil Rate the half-man, half-leopard excellent Golden Axe 3 coin-op in creature who's like an overgrown the arcades this is going to be a bipedal pussycat really, and Proud bitter disappointment to you as Cragger, a giant human who the Megadrive version is comdoesn't have enough brain cells to pletely different. The gameplay is make a pair. identical to the previous two games, with you taking your cho ZUOLA sen hero through a series of of horizontally scrolling levels, battering the heck out of anything which gets in your way. Hardly what you'd call deep. The most noticeable difference between the games are the characters. The Dwarf has now been pensioned off, preferring instead to stand on Stop! Hammer time. VERDICT I'm getting sick and tired of the Golden Axe saga. It wouldn't be so bad if the games were a bit different to each other, but Sega has gone for the same horizontally scrolling hack 'n slay which got players of the original all hot and sweaty, but made those who bought the sequel all hot and bothered because it was practically the same game. If anything, Golden Axe 3 is worse than before with low quality sprites, gaudy backdrops and unimpressive gameplay. There are better games than this the original Golden Axe being just one of them. PAUL ANGLIN 54 "


"SWORD PLAY VERDICT MEGADRIVE Sega promised so much with this game, saying that 'It's nothing like Golden Axe 2'. It sounded good, but the end result wouldn't look out of place on a Master System. Have the programmers been locked up a dark room for the last four years so they don't know what Megadrive games look like now? The backdrops are truly some of the most appalling ever seen on the Megadrive, and the animation is comparable to the original Golden Axe game which is years old. Two words describe this game perfectly; Not and Good. Between them, this quintet of weirdos has to battle through the forces of absolute darkness on a quest to recover the Golden Axe, etc, etc. What it boils down to is you, and possibly a mate if you have a second joypad and any friends, choosing the characters you think are the hardest, then thrashing the life out of the game's villains. These are a collection of barbarians, skeletons, knights and fat blokes who seem to like nothing better than running onto the end of fists and dutifully falling over when hit. Each character has a varied set of moves, ranging from straightforward slashes to devastating throws. There's only one attack button, which means that the move your character executes depends on how close you are to the enemy. When the going gets really tough, pressing B and C pulls off a special attack which makes your character go completely loopy, lashing out in all directions and generally getting him out of trouble. PROS:Loads of levels and stacks of moves. CONS:Boring, tedious, dull, unattractive. Is that enough? PAUL RAND DEATH SQUAD APHIES Horrid yellow backdrops and animation that's fluid like ice isn't. You get to control one of four characters, each of whom possesses different strengths and weaknesses. CAHN GRINDER Speed: Good Strength: Average Hardness: Vinny Jones Now that can't be nice. 02 SOUND Scratchy digitised yells and slicing noises. Not much at all. CHRONOS EVIL RATE Speed: Like youknow-what off a shovel Strength: Puny Hardness: Cuddly GAMEPLAY Picks up towards the end of the game, but dull to begin with. the end of the 56 SARA BURN Speed: Fast Strength: Middling Hardness: Lots It might not be good, but it's certainly very big. PROUD CRAGGER Speed: Worse than a 2CV Strength: Yes Hardness: Rock STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES DI TUL ONWAUOVO LLLLLLLLLL TUTTI ON THE OTHER HAND MISS U STREETS OF RAGE 2 'If it's beat 'em up action you're after you won't get any better than this on the Megadrive. It's sooo much better than Golden Axe 3, it's well worth the extra couple of quid. 62 95 REVIEWED: ISSUE 135 Does Clare know about the wings? 55 "


"REVIEW SNES SNESTI by SEKA .99 OUT: On Import. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the cartridge. R BATERIA The SNES conversion of the Amiga shoot 'em up classic is here! My, that's a big weapon! Where's not much of a plot to Turrican, but face it, a game like this doesn't really need one. Quite simply, as an agent of the United Planets Freedom Forces you've been sent to the distant world of Katakis to destroy its evil robotic ruler. Your only defence comes in the form of your Turrican assault suit, a device which turns your weedy agent into one of the deadliest killing machines in the galaxy and makes him a big hit with the girlies at the same time. Top blasting action ahoy! This weapon is a killer! 338 VERDICT DEAD LEVEL The game is set across 12 increasingly huge levels -so huge it's possible to go right through a stage without seeing most of it. Just to let you know how much you've missed, you're told how many lives and gems you failed to collect. Many areas are only accessible through secret passages, but it's worth tracking them down as they often contain loads of bonuses and cut out large lumps of the stage. No matter which route you take, they all lead to the same point and, obviously, some routes are better than others, coughing up more bonuses and less nasties. The only way to find these paths is through trial and error... 56 Crush him like a bug! Talk about hard on the eyes! Turrican is a visual and audio feast. The graphics are garish and bold; play in a darkened room and you'll be seeing spots for weeks! The sound is equally amazing, especially if you got a surround sound set up. Once you've survived the sensory onslaught you've got to try and get through the game, which is nigh-on impossible. The 12 levels are massive, and incredibly challenging, not to mention packed to bursting point with hidden passages. Pure, mindless fun and no mistake. PAUL ANGLIN "


"UP YOUR ARSENAL VERDICT SNES lendo Ramicom The Turrican assault suit is the hardest single piece of kit in the galaxy, imbuing its wearer with incredible strength and a 'huge array of weapons. Initially the suit comes with a very basic gun and a device called a freeze beam, neither of which are brilliant when it comes to dealing death to intergalactic hordes. Super Turrican is essentially the same as every other version of the game. What is does offer is a huge challenge which will test to the limits anyone who reckons they're even a bit good at action games. Each level is so massive you can go back time after time and still discover new areas. Despite being its best feature, Turrican's size is also detrimental. Each stage has a time limit which prevents you exploring large parts of the levels. Personally I prefer Super Contra, but this is still one of the better SNES blasts this summer. PROS:It's completely huge and packed to the brim with action. CONS:Difficult to the point of causing severe temper tantrums in some places. PAUL RAND Now that's a BIG baddy! Red: A very excellent spread shot which takes out enemies in front, above and below. TB411 TOMMT GRAPHICS Big, colourful sprites and bright parallax backgrounds. Blue: A straightforward, noholds barred, total deathdealing laser ONNOS Zaps, whoops, bangs and the occasional good tune, all in surround sound. GAMEPL Frustrating at times, but at least there's plenty to kill. Yellow: Bounce shots which are pretty good for firing around corners, but aren't very powerful. WHIRLING DERVISH One of the Turrican suit's weirdest features is its ability to tum the wearer into a whirling circular saw blade of death. Not only is it deadly to most alien lifeforms, it also allows you to roll down passages which would otherwise be too small. Sounds strange? Here's how it works. server Very taxing, and massive to the extreme. 85 Things are getting hectic and energy is running low; a Steve McQueen-esque great escape is needed. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES, Freeze beam: A long-range, weapon which temporarily freezes any enemies it touches. Brrr! SOD TIL  NONWA Clear some space then crouch down. Press fire and your hero transforms into a spinning death blade. Smart wall: Sends out a wall of energy either side of the suit, wiping out everything in its path. MISS OK! HT 83 Shield: Temporary immunity from the rigours of intergalactic adventuring. Steer by moving left and right. Death to everything it touches! Hitting fire in this form lays mines and fires dead nifty rockets. 57 "

"PUTER ANS COMPU VIDEO GAMES GB Sensi it's the biz! Score with Pele! Sensisoccer on GG! EA Soccer on target! MAS Super Soccer II! Kevin Keegan on SNES! RASEGA lhe soccer season has started and with it comes the annual deluge of football games to tease, tantalise and test the patience of all those heartily sick of seeing such titles! There shouldn't be much annoyance this year, though; although there's the usual stack of soccer sims already released and on the way, many of them are of tip-top quality. In this exclusive CVG special, we give you a look at some of the best and worst footy games released and coming to your machine during the next few months. Some are brand new, others conversions of old favourites. All of them are hot names, but will they all be top games? CVG tells you what's good and what's crud! So get stuck in as you all now by now, we never hold back on the crunching tackle! SPAINT ITALY MD Sensi storms in! The Ultimate Soccer game on Sega? 61 "


"REVIEW MEGADRI MEGADRIVE by SEGA .99 OUT: September. Contact Sega (071 373 3000) for information. Hmm, should be a pretty fair match. OPTIONS LL NDLY MITC: HOT B. N O 92* BAE LUMPUTLI LIVERPOOL ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO WIN SOMETHING THIS SEASON 'If multi-player games are your thing, then you've got it made with Ultimate Soccer. By plugging in two of Sega's four-player adaptors you can have up to eight people playing in a tournament! There is no option that allows two players to control one team, which is probably a good thing seeing as most efforts at trying that turn out to be complete cack, but what you can do is have every person controlling a full team and start up a league competition as you can imagine, the competition can get pretty fierce. PITI BUREEEE NORMAL Here's all the options; tweak to your heart's content. What with the new season upon us, we can expect a barrage of footy games in the coming months oh look, here comes the first one now! Wrn OnAmATT emember last month's review of Striker on the SNES? You do? Well this month we have for you the wondrous Striker on Megadrive, except now it's called Ultimate Soccer. Ultimate Soccer presents you with much the same viewpoint as Striker, but you are given the option to go a bit closer into the pitch if you so wish. The only difference is that, if you use the deeper viewpoint, the screen closes up tighter on the players and you see less of the pitch. In fact, the main differences between the SNES and Megadrive versions of Striker lie purely in the huge amount of options that you can tweak to suit your style of play. VERDICT Like its SNES forefather, Ultimate Soccer features three different competitions that you can enter. Ultimate league allows you to chose anything between 2 and 32 teams to take part in the league, As with all normal leagues, you'll play each team twice and then at the end of the season the winner will be announced. The good thing about the league is that you can select as many or as few teams as you want, so you don't have to play for hours before finishing the competition. The other two tournaments are essentially very much the same. Ultimate Cup features 24 teams battling it out for the prestige of the cup; as with the league competition, the Ultimate Cup features a password option so you can save your progress into the comp. Ultimate Knockout is probably the most fun option. You select 16 teams to play in the tournament and then the scrap really starts. The rules are very simple; if you lose a game, you're out! If you win all your games, the marvellous trophy is yours. Hurrah! My first impressions of Ultimate Soccer were something along the lines of \"Urggh\". The scrolling isn't the smoothest thing in the world and the sprites look a little rough around the edges. In the end, this all amounts to a game that is rather hard to get into, but thankfully, once you do get there you realise how good it is. The huge amount of options that you can choose from gives you huge scope for realistic footy frolics; you can change everything from the surface of the pitch to the weight of the ball! Not quite the SNES version, but damned good in its own right. PAUL ANGLIN If the man on the post gets to that, it's a certain goal. 62 "


"VERDICT MEGADRIVE Considering the unusual 3D scrolling found in Striker, it was always going to be difficult to pull off on the Megadrive because it lacks any graphics hardware. While the overall effect isn't as good as the Nintendo version, it's still an impressive example of into-the-screen scrolling. The game itself isn't quite as playable as its SNES counterpart, but it's got some options that its forefather doesn't possess, the ability to play with eight players being just one. This has some way to go to beat the likes of Super Kick Off for playability, but you could do worse than try it for size. ...BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY RATHER GOOD! You can choose between five different types of ball control: loose, dribble, push, normal or tight. The idea is that you start off playing with tight control, then you switch to loose where you'll need a touch more skill to get past play. ers. Everything imaginable has been included in Ultimate Soccer, even the new backpass rule, which is a bit irrelevant because it's very rare that you need to pass back to your keeper anyway PROS: Loads of scope for long term realistic gameplay. Great fun with eight players. CONS: Scrolling is a little suspect and the game can be a touch difficult to get into compared to its SNES counterpart. PAUL RAND BE GREAT LIKE IAN RUSH IN THREE EASY STEPS 1) Run your player tight to 1) Run to the edge of the 1) Run tight to the line. the line. box GRAPHICS Nice sprites, if a little rough around the edges. Slightly marred by dodgy sorolling 2) Hoof the ball towards the far post. ONNOS Reasonable effects and some convincing crowd noises. 2) When you get about here, cross the ball in to the area. 2) Shoot from here and curl the ball towards the goal. GAMEPLAY Once you get into the thick of it, you'll forget all about the hassle you had getting 3) Take it on the head... 3) Have the man at the back post pick the ball up. Note: This sudden change of direction will send the keeper completely the wrong way see pic. 3) Unstoppable! There's many a reason to be playing this for a very long time.

League had everyone here going soccer mad. It takes a couple of goes to get used to the control method but it's sooo playable once you do. This is one of the best Megadrive footy sims around, not least because you can play as Rineker san! REVIEWED: CVG No141 Welcome to the hop, skip and jump school of penalty taking. "


"REVIEW SNES by IMAGINEER .99 OUT: October. Contact Imagineer (0322 292 513) for information. VAT ith football fever biting at most consoles, and record numbers of soccer games being thrust upon us, there's finally a game which not only lets you have a good knockabout on the pitch, but deal with all the behind-the-scenes wheeler-dealing as well. Player Manager first appeared on floppy machines back in '91, where it cashed in on the phenomenal success of the ONE OF THE BEST FOOTY MANAGEMENT GAMES original Kick Off. The SNES version is essentially EVER COMES TO THE SNES AND HOW! the same game, with a few cosmetic changes and the endorsement of all-time Liverpool, England and now Newcastle footy great, Kevin Keegan! Choose team formation from here. The transfer table. And it's a bit bare. KEVIN KEEGAN MERCHANT TOT MERCHANT BANKERS TUDI M INUTI   DI Looming over the club like a bird that's ready to drop a particularly big sticky one, is the spectre of the bank. If the club starts to lose money, the board, rather than have it go into receivership, will threaten you with the sack. The only way to survive this is by flogging off players, often at discount prices. It doesn't stop there; if you start making loads of cash and hold on to it the board will rec ommend you go out and buy some new players or, again, clear out your desk. Revenue is generated mainly through ticket sales, and people only come to see your team when you're winning. Premier division teams have it a lot easier; not only are their players worth more when they flog them, but they automatically attract larger crowds. They also pull in lots of money through sponsorship and get paid wads for any matches shown on TV. The referee takes a dim view of particularly nasty tackles, so watch out. VERDICT INFORMASI WDEXECATORIA The only downside of this game is that Rand hasn't shut up about meeting Kevin Keegan yet. Once he does that this will be the perfect console football sim. The Kick Off aspect prevents it from becoming dull during flat bits of the season, while the management section contains enough weight to keep Kevin Keegan's Player Manager interesting in the long term. My only criticism is that the icons could have been more self-explanitory having to refer back to the manual every five minutes soon had me well wound up. This is the first football management game on SNES and if other such titles appear they're going to have to be VERY good, because Kevin Keegan's Player Manager is quite simply the best all-round footy game on the market. It's matchday! Get ready to play... AUCO Step 1: Select your team! Injuries and suspensions severely deplete a team's strength, so it's down to you to gauge the strength of the opposition and rest up the players who you think you won't need. GARY WHITTA The main selection screen. 64 "


"TRICKS 'N TACTICS VERDICT SR 140803 OOR You want to hope the keeper's awake! Not being the biggest fan of management games myself, I approached Kevin Keegan's Player Manager with some reservations. Luckily, those reservations were quickly quashed. This is a blinder of a game, which doesn't rely on swanky graphics to lure the player in; it comes down almost totally on the side of pure addictiveness to do the job. The graphics are a bit bland, but that's not important. The sound is hit-an-miss, but that's not impor tant, either. What is important is the sheer amount of gameplay stored in the SNES cartridge really too much to do justice to it here. Even if you hate this type of game, Kevin Keegan's Player Manager will eventually turn you around. The first of its kind on SNES, and the best for a long time to come. # 333 If you want to cut it in the highoctane world of Premier League management, you're going to need to kick your brain into gear and head to the boot room to work out your tactics. There are plenty of formations to choose from, ranging from the relatively safe 44-2, to the last ditch, must-score 5-1-4 all-players-forward pattern. Most players are suited to particular positions, such as midfielders and wingers. However, there always comes a time when you don't have the right player for the squad, so you'll need to turn to a utility player, if you have one in your squad. These guys can fill in the gaps at any position, bar goalkeeper, with only one disadvantage they're very poor when it comes to shooting. Should things become utterly desperate there's always the transfer market to turn to. Here you need to put on the old Arthur Daley hat to try and knock down the price, and often splash out more than you bargained for to bring the squad up to full strength before an important match. PAUL ANGLIN Why not give the players a bonus? Oh no! Archibald's out for a fortnight! These lads should do the job for you. Close, but no cigar. To throw in, just push in the direction you wish the ball to go and hit fire. MATCH DAY Before you even think about heading to a rival's ground for a kickabout, there are loads of preparations to make. 100 > TIMES SSOREISSOS PRODROKOK ZATE OUTGLASSCOM Step 2: If you're up against a particularly tough team you might want to opt for a more defensive formation, or for a lesser club you'll want to throw your forwards up and hammer in as many goals as possible. Step 3: Finally your team runs out on the pitch and prepares for kick-off. Step 4: Oh dear, they seem to be scoring rather a lot of goals. Perhaps it's time to change formation. Something more defensive might be in order; you probably won't score, but at least it will limit the damage. Step 5: Well and truly thrashed. What can you say? \"Please don't sack me\" is a start, but whether the board will listen or not depends on your past performances. "


"KICK OFF! PROS: Loads of features and an excellent mix of strategy and action. CONS: The dazzling array of icons make the game a little over-complicated in places. Unlike the vast majority of football management games where the 'action' is depicted in text form, or by complicated little graphs, in Kevin Keegan's Player Manager you actually get to participate in a real game of Kick Off 2! This is a faithful recreation of the Amiga classic, right down to the aftertouch facility. Obviously, as good as it is, having to play a vast amount of matches during a season, not including cups, would become not a little tedious in one sitting, so there are options which allow you to either watch matches, or skip the on-pitch action altogether and go straight to the results. After Looks like Kevin's been at the Grecian 2000! each match is over you're shown a newspaper headline reporting on the team's performance, then depending on the result you're either praised or dragged over hot A player's attributes are broken down into several categories, with a yelcoals by the board.

MORALE: No problems if the player likes the club, otherwise his performance drops. SHOOTING: This shows how accurate a player he is in front of the goalmouth.

And this one most certainly is! For the first game of its kind on the SNES, Kevin Keegan's is the benchmark for all those who try similar games on cartridge. It's a thoroughly addictive piece of software that sucks you in from the word go, and doesn't let you go for a minute. It's battery-backed, allowing you to save your progress through the leagues, and there's even a Kick Off 2 arcade section in there which is better than the official SNES version of Kick Off itself! If you're tired of the same old stuff, then take a look at Kevin Keegan's Player Manager immediately you'll be glad you did! MSSK HIT FLAIR: Is he another Gazza?

"MEGADRIVE by ELECTRONIC ARTS TBA PREVIEW AUTUMN RELEASE Stage of Development 75% Completed SPORTS SOCCER Chip the goalkeeper and the fans will love you forever. The company that's already conquered Golf, Basketball, Hockey and American Football is now having a crack at the greatest sport of all. But can a bunch of Yanks do justice to a game they know next to nothing about? turned its attention to the world's most popular sport. The Game of Billions. Soccer. It's a prospect that should get footy fans drooling with excitement and feeling a bit wary at the same time. EA Sports has produced a brilliant simulation of just about every sport it's touched so far, but soccer is a completely different kettle of fish. It's not an American game, never has been. They don't like it, and most don't even understand it. So how can an American company be expected to succeed where so many others have failed and produce a faithful and playable recreation of our great game? According to EA Sports, though, CRAZY Football is now GA Tour Golf. The NBA Playoffs. NHLPA Hockey. John Madden Football. Four of the best sports games on any machine anywhere, and all, remarkably, from the same stable EA Sports. Electronic Arts' dedicated in-house label has produced some sporty stunners in its time, but they've all been based around games played mainly by Americans. Basketball, Ice Hockey and American Football are hardly big sports over here, after all. But with the increasing popularity of EA Sports' wares in Europe, and the US World Cup just around the corner, the team has finally Corner kicks are placed with a high-tech crosshair type of thing. 68 "


"teams from around the globe competing in a round-robin tournament for a fictional trophy. All the teams are based on the real things, with recognisable playing styles and strategies to get to grips with. And the realism continues down on the pitch literally. The playing surface changes during the match according to ble weather condition and, like Sensible Soccer, the background crowd noises are «context sensitive» with cheers, groans and a host of traditional soccer chants accompanying the on-field action. Fans of traditional soccer sim features will be pleased to hear that there's a VCR-style action replay option, so you can view your favourite goals, tackles etc again and again with slow motion and freeze frame options allowing players to analyse play in more detail. Its main use though, as we all know, is to show off your silky skills to your mates. With plenty of work still to be done on crucial elements like player control, EA Sports Soccer is still some way from completion, but already it's looking like a championship contender. It's due for release on Megadrive in November, with Super NES and possibly Amiga versions to follow, depending on its success. We The flying foul always gets a good reaction from the crowd. Over 'ere son, on me 'ead! Sliding tackles look good, but they rough up the turf. SPORTS Spot the ball. Stick it up the wing! it's not a problem. EA has the same concerns about the American handling of a very unAmerican sport, so while the programming itself is taking place across the Atlantic (in Canada to be precise), the game is being designed and the whole project co-ordinated right here in the UK by people who know the sport and what makes a soccer game tick. The idea seems to have worked although it's still in the relatively early stages of development, it's already looking like one of the most polished soccer sims of the year. Unlike most footy games, which adopt either a top-down or sideon view, EA Sports Soccer goes for a more innovative three-quarter isometric perspective. It's not like any camera angle you'll see on TV coverage, but it allows for maximum visibility of the players and the pitch. Graphically, EA Soccer is going all-out to impress. The player sprites are made up of over 2,000 animation frames to take care of everything a real footballer can do not just dribbling and tackling, but authentic diving headers, bicycle kicks, leg and chest traps and jinxing round defenders. Trust us, they look good. As to the game itself, it's based on an international theme with 40 reckon that when push comes to shove in the footy free-for-all this Autumn, EA Sports Soccer could turn out to have the biggest boots in the ballpark. Oh, and look out for news of a special big-name licence which, if all goes well, will be tied into the game a la John Madden. We'll keep you posted, but in the meantime look and drool... Get the boot in, my son! Go in studs first for more shin damage. A save worthy of Tim Flowers himself. 69 "


"REVIEW by HUMAN .99 SNES JIMMY OUT: On import. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the cartridge. TREVOR GE There aren't a massive amount of options that you can play around with here, save for a few more competitions and the option to choose an all-star team. The new comps are Exhibition, One-cup tournament or a penalty shootout. The cup is quite a challenge as you have to play against all the computer controlled teams to win, which can take some doing. The penalty shootouts are worth practising because any game that ends in a Euggh, get away from me. draw instantly goes to penalties. For those of you out there who are suffering from deja vu, you're right! You have seen these exact same screenshots before well, almost. The graphics have more or less remained unchanged; oh blow it, I'm sorry but this really is just the same game as the original. There are a couple of little changes but not nearly enough to warrant an entirely new game. We would prefer the PC Engine version of this to the SNES one, and that's not much cop either! PROS: Umm, ean't think of any. CONS: This looks like the kind of SNES game that was being churned out about 18 months ago complete cack! GRAPHICS The SNES can do much better than this. These sprites are awful. ONNOS Tragic speech at kick-off and unconvincing effects. FOOTB CRAZ GAMEPLAY What little gameplay there is bores you absolutely rigid in minutes. sequel. What value?

Super Soccer was one as it's knocking on of the first games available for the machine and makers a bit now, Human Human have come up with a thought it about thought it about sequel Does it make a firstteam appearance, or will it time to release a limp around like Bryan Robson after a week into the season? There are still a ton of international teams to choose from and the bizarre pitch perspective has been retained, but it does it have any playability? BRIAN For all SNES-owning footy maniacs out there, don't worry too much; hope for a decent SNES game of footy is not lost. For instance, look Just beyond the keeper. at last month's review of the fine Striker, and take a peek through this issue there are loads of top soccer games coming out on the SNES at the moment. Of the ones we've seen, it looks as though Ooh dear, I don't think I've seen a football game this bad for a very long time. Striker is going to be the biggie, but there's a few more to come The big problem with Super Soccer ll is simple: the game is almost identical to the yet so watch CVG and we'll tell you original, and whereas that may have been okay a just which ones to get and which year ago, games have moved on a huge amount since then and this is really showing its age horto avoid rendously. The game is just so slow and crap that 03:06 you're bored with it inside of one go. It seems as though Human are stuck in the dark ages of SNES technology and haven't realised what this machine can actually do yet, and produced a game that shows exactly that. Very poor.

"MEGADRIVE by ACCOLADE The greatest footballer of all time doesn't lend his name to just any old game so what's so special about Accolade's latest? Around .00 PREVIEW AUTUMN RELEASE Stage of Development 65% Completed Homing in on goal. Don't bottle out now! PELE! Oh, so close! e's still regarded as the greatest player the world has ever known. His name has been a legend around the world for the last thirty years. The man IS football. He's Pele, former captain of Brazil, multiple World Cup winner and currently the sport's greatest ambassador to the world. And, of course, the man whose name adorns Accolade's entry into the Autumn soccer battle. It always helps to have a big name team or star endorsing your game, and they don't come any bigger than Pele. Licence aside, Pele! the game is shaping up to go head-to-head with EA Sports Soccer when it's released in November on Megadrive and Super NES. There are definite similarities between the two, not least the 35 degree isometric viewpoint that both games employ. Add to that the fact that both games feature 40 teams from around the world, have changeable weather and replay features AND are both being programmed in Canada, and it all gets a bit like an episode from the Twilight Zone. Only one game, though, can claim to have THAT name on it. \"I helped design the game, so you It's easy to dribble when the ball sticks to your feet. know it's realistic,\" says Pele. \"I'm also available throughout the game as a coach. We use the attributes and characteristics of real players, and feature games played in various kinds of players, and feature games played in various kinds of weather. You can even play as me in a special skills contest. The game's just the way I like it physical, exciting and powerful.\" Rather than EA Soccer's round robin tournament, Pele! takes players through a 30-match league season, with the 40 clubs from Europe and Latin America. In addition, if you really fancy your chances, you can go up against a faithful recreation of the Brazilian 1962 World Cup winning side, captained by Pele himself. \"Everything about the game offers true-to-life soccer, from the crowd chants to the tilted 35 degree perspective of the pitch which gives a TV-style feel, and an additional option to replay the best moves from a match.\" So says producer Robery Daly, anyway. At time of writing, Pele was still looking a little rough around the edges, as development team Radical still has a lot of work to do on the look and feel of the whole thing. One thing that's already in, though, is a digitised attract sequence featuring clips of Pele's greatest goals. \"Love is more important than we take in life. Everything passes\", says Pele. And who are we to argue? Top midfield action. EUROPEAN =PO SA Erm... this is a player kicking the ball. Take your pick of all the teams in Europe. "


"MULTI-FORMATS SUPER NINTENDO by SONY TBA PREVIEW AUTUMN RELEASE SEVGIDIE Stage of Development 90% Completed DOCCER FOOTBALL at last surfaced on GAME GEAR The biggest Amiga game of 1992 has at last surfaced on consoles! Sensible Soccer is on its way to (deep breath) Super NES, Megadrive, Game Boy, Game Gear, Master System and NES from Renegade and Sony. CVG's ALL-FORMATS EXCLUSIVE has all the details... CRAZLO Ooyah! Get the studs in! If Sensible Soccer wasn't one of the biggest software events on any format last year, I'll eat a pair of tofu trousers. Regarded by many as The Best Amiga Game Ever, it's also the biggest selling Amiga title of all time, which isn't bad going. But if ever a game deserved the success it got, it's Sensible Software's answer to the Kick Off phenomenon, a game that took Dino Dini's original idea and improved upon it massively to create a computer footballing experience second to none. For many, Sensible Soccer is one of the main reasons to own an Amiga rather than a console. But not for long. Sensible Soccer is at last nearing completion on consoles, and judging by exclusive CVG playtests carried out this month, the new versions are even better than the Amiga original! Megadrive and Super NES versions lead the way, and have both been produced by Sensible, the game's original creators, while the 8-bit versions have been farmed out amongst the industry's top thirdparty developers. But whatever machine you own, you're guaranteed a tip-top conversion. Console owners not familiar with Sensible Soccer but looking for a visual feast are probably in for a disappointment, however. Although the presentation has been spruced up for the 16-bit machines, Sensible Soccer isn't about fancy graphics and sound it's about gameplay, pure and simple, and that's why it's been such a massive success on floppy. Its realistic and instinctive control method, fast, fluid action and atmosphere The Game Gear version is one of the best of the lot. 72 "


"GAME BOY The teams line up for the national anthems That famous title screen Fast, smooth and playable that's Game Boy Sensi! combine to create a game that's not only extremely playable, but actually feels like a real game of football. More than anything else, this is what Sensible and the other developers have tried to port across onto the new console versions, and they've even added a few new gameplay tweaks and enhancements for good measure. More on those extras in a bit. Generally, Sensible Soccer on consoles is a carbon copy of the original. Everything is in there, from the full list of national, domestic and comedy teams to the manager's bench, the tournament designer, match highlights... everything, in fact, that the Amiga player enjoyed, plus a bit more besides. Most of the changes that have been made have been forced by the new formats, so now there's a battery back-up facility to save your current tournament, the option to play in-game music (no console game would be complete without it) and slight changes have been made to the names of the real-life players for copyright reasons, so, for example, instead of Des Walker you'll get Das Welker or something equally spurious. But don't worry, you can still change the names of players and teams to whatever you like. Sensible Soccer now features three levels of difficulty Beginner, Normal and Advanced. In the original game the ball never fully stuck to the player's foot. It all depended on the playing surface, how far the player was from the ball and other factors, so it took skill to control and dribble the ball. Now, console players can simply select Beginner level and have the ball stick to their feet like glue, making for much easier control. On the higher levels, however, the ball has more of a life of its own, so there's a touch more skill involved. The console joypads' extra buttons haven't been wasted, either. With more kick controls to play with, the new versions have made much more use of the star players on each team. These million pound wonders are marked by (you guessed it) a star over their heads, and when one of them is in control of the ball, a shot of the A button (rather than the usual B for kick) produces a thunderbolt blast of a shot at goal, no matter what direction you're facing at the time. These shots are much faster and harder to save than normal ones, so in a sense it's more like real football if you have a star striker, you'll want to get the ball to him as often as possible so he can blast it into the net. Because of the power of the kick, the «shoot on goal\" button is also well used by defendTime to dig deep, lads. ers and midfielders for giving the ball an almighty welly up the pitch. Megadrive and Super NES owners can look forward to a version of Sensible Soccer that graphically and sonically is every bit as meaty as the original, but what about the smaller machines? Well, though Master System and NES versions may look a little blocky, the gameplay has been translated faithfully, and both have an impressive turn of speed. And the hand-helds are a particularly pleasant surprise the Game Gear is actually faster and smoother than the Master System, while the Game Boy, although some changes have had to be made to the scale of the pitch and players, seems to have captured the original's fast, fluid feel. All in all, no matter what machine you own, it looks as though you're in for a right royal footballing feast by the end of the year. It's not a simultaneous release, but all versions should be launched within a few weeks of each other, starting in late October. Keep 'em peeled for the CVG reviews, coming soon...

"AMIGA by VIRGIN .99 OUT: Now. Contact Virgin (081 960 2255) for more information. The Emperor isn't pleased with you. An advisor to the Atreides. Death, destruction and deserts in Virgin's game of the film of the book t's a rare day when a PC game is converted to the Amiga without losing any of its speed or character. So it's kudos to Virgin (as they say in some parts) for coming up with an Amiga version of Dune 2 which is every bit as good as the original. The game's plot is a horrifically complicated meld of futuristic politics and trading. Basically, as leader of one of three major trading houses you've been given the contract to mine spice, which is a potent fuel allowing light-speed travel, on the desert world of Arrakis. The more spice you gather the more rewards you reap. Of course, it also helps to do over the houses in the process, thus earning wads of money and respect. This vehic This vehicle mines the spice. BATTLE ZONE Combat is a simple matter of selecting one of your units then clicking on what you want them to destroy. Each team has a limited energy rating, which depletes as they take hits. It's much quicker to repair an injured squad than it is to build a new one, so a tactical withdrawal, or running like the wind, is often a good move. If you're not too good at marshalling your forces, it's worth playing as the Harkonnen, who are the most aggressive of the three houses. This way you eliminate the side most likely to attack you. Look mummy, it's the scary Emperor. VERDICT The film may be stupid and a bit crap, but the original Dune game wasn't too bad. And the sequel is a scorcher! Virgin has done a grand job of converting Dune 2 from the PC, losing nothing in the transition. Graphically the game is quite spartan, but that's due to the nature of the thing. There's a dollop of fine sampled speech in there, and more importantly, lots of strategic planning and battling to be had. Not everyone is a fan of this genre, mainly because they've never given the genre a chance. And Dune 2 is such an absorbing title that it would a sin to let it pass you by. Select your louse Cyril congratulates you on winning a campaign. 74 PAUL RAND Atreides cos Barkonners "


"LOADSASTRATEGY VERDICT ducin Right from the off you can tell that a lot of time has been invested in prothis game. The presentation throughout, from the excellent graphic cut scenes to the digitised speech, is top-notch. While it looks very good, Dune 2 is very similar to the first game. So if you've got that, I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you're new to Dune you're in for a real treat. Dune 2 has everything you could ask for in a strategy game, from trading and politics to a thoroughly well worked-out plot. If you fancy spending a few hours locked up with a real heavy-hitting game you won't get any better than this. The game is heavily strategy based as you attempt to out-trade and out-fight your rivals. The main source of your power comes from your excellent build-anything factories, which produce tanks, soldiers, spice-mining vehicles and everything else a healthy spice refinery needs. Every so often one of your opponents decides that political wheeling and dealing isn't enough, they'll try and take over you installation by force. If you're well prepared this isn't as bad as it seems, as you simply unleash your dogs of war and put on your Napoleon hat for a high-tech barney in the desert. PROS:Stunning graphics help to create an excellent atmosphere CONS:Can be heavy going at times. STEVE KEEN THREE STAGES IN THE LIFE OF A SPICE MINER CONSTRUCT-O-BASE Incredible static shots and characters. GRAPHICS Building on sand isn't a very wise idea, but owing to the lack of rock on Arrakis, this is what you must do. Before you attempt any sort of construction you first have to lay down giant concrete slabs. Only when they're in place can you order the creation of useful sites such as: PONUNUNUNSUEL der 7 SOUND Strange music and some excellent digitised speech. 1. You've just landed on the planet and all you have are a couple of soldiers and a factory. The first thing to build is a Wind Trap, which is a sort of power station. This will give you the resources to build other, larger installations. GAMEPLAY Some people might never get into this. SENTATIOPTROHS Cod Light Vehicle factory: This installation produces nippy little armoured cars, allowing you to create a rapid response force. Wind Traps: Power is essential, and the only way you're going to get any is by building these giant ecofriendly wind traps. If you like it, you'll be playing for months. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 2. Once you're up and running, the next thing to build is the spice refinery. This comes complete with harvester, so you don't have to build one of those. 9 8 CENTAUIT OPTIONS Credits Spice Refinery: There's no point in sending your people out mining for spice if you can't do anything with it. Build a refinery and you can create perfectly usable spice while burning off any unwanted elements into the atmosphere. Infantry Barracks: General infantrymen are cheap to train, although this is reflected by them not actually being any good in a straight fight. Still, they come in very handy for holding up determined enemy attacks while you produce decent units. ONWAO NO TIIIIIIIII|| MWIL TITUTII MIND YOUR MENTATS MISS DK HIT 3. The final stage is fortification. A well-built installation is a prime target for enemy forces, so you have to protect it. Light vehicle factories, barracks and other specialist buildings allow you to create military units to fend off enemy attacks and launch a few raids of your own. Advising the various houses are the mysterious Mentats. These are a race of people who are completely brainy, and very nosy, so they always have the latest information. Should you play the house Atreides, your Mentat is Cyril. While this doesn't sound like much of a name for an intergalactic Einstein, he's the only Mentat in the game who isn't completely out of his tree. It pays to listen carefully to his advice if you want to get the upper hand over your twisted rivals. 89 75 "


"CVG COMPETITION CVG CON WIN! SLY'S    CTFFHANGER   CLIMBING ROPE! As used by Sylvester Stallone in the movie! PLUS Tons of Cliffhanger soundtrack CDs and Columbia vids! COURTESY OF SONY "


"PETITION CVG COMPETITIC o, we're not joking. Not since we gave away Arnie's actual Terminator 2 T-shirt have we had a prize quite as mouth-watering for film fans as this. We all know how Sylvester Stallone's high-altitude thriller Cliffhanger has been wowing audiences around the world of late. Let's face it, it's a bit of a top-class action fest (poor little Paul Anglin felt quite queasy for a few weeks after first seeing it, and still has problems travelling up to the top floor of CVG Towers), so a completely authentic and original prop, especially one used by the man Sly himself, would be rather a first-class giveaway, don't you think? Well brace yourself, because that's exactly what we've got! After several weeks of hush-hush talks with Sony Imagesoft, who are producing the Cliffhanger video games, we've managed to secure one of the actual climbing ropes, complete with all the metal bits at the end, used by Sly as he takes on top international terrorists across the Rocky mountains in the movie. Without this rope and the metal bits, Sly's character would undoubtedly have been killed and the terrorists would have triumphed, so you can see how important a prop it was. This authentic item is just the thing with which to impress your Cliffhanger fan mates. And, even though it's a movie prop it performs all the functions of a real rope, so you can use it to tie things up, tow cars and everything! And that's not all! In addition to the Cliffhanger rope, the winner will also receive an original Cliffhanger movie soundtrack on CD AND five Columbia/TriStar videos of their choice! Not too shabby. But what if you're not so lucky? What if your postcard isn't the first one pulled out of the CVG hat, but one of the ten that follow it? Well, as a runner-up you'll be sent a Cliffhanger CD soundtrack and any Columbia vid you like.

"VERDICT MEGADRIVE DEATH EXTREME General Chaos gives you one simple task wipe out the enemy using every means at your disposal. All this is done in a humorous vein; at least it's as humorous as you can get when the opposition is burning to death at the hands of your flamethrower-wielding psycho commandos. As a General you command an attack squad consisting of between two and five heavily armed soldiers, issuing orders to them individually as they try to get one over the enemy. General Chaos seemed my sort of game; lots of needless violence and not much thought. After a few games I started to come to terms with the fact that this wasn't the case. The violence is there but the brainpower required would make Einstein skulk off for a couple of Nurofen. The problem is caused by you having to control your team members individually. This means that unless you can think on five levels at once, you're going to have a hard time keeping your squad out of harm's way. A good game let down by a dodgy control method. PROS: Humorous animation and total and utter carnage on the combat field. CONS: Controlling five soldiers at once is awkward and the missions aren't varied enough. PAUL ANGLIN BOOT CAMP HRAPHICS Small sprites but humorous animation and big explosions. Ooyah! Suitable music and plenty of explosive sound effects. Before you enter the battlefield it pays to haul ass to the boot! camp. Here you're trained in the fine art of close combat, as you're taken through each stage of the game one by one. It's essential for novice combat-meisters to attend basic training if you don't want to find your massed legions slaughtered on the battlefield the morning after You're taken through the art of fighting stepby-step, although the general theme tends to be blow the heck out everything that's not on your side. Guns galore! The control method is frustrating and brings down the whole game. Crikey! Things are getting heated. It's fun with two or more players, but becomes dull on your own. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Da boyz! 8 VERDICT SMELLS LIKE TEAM SPIRIT III IIIIIIIIIII O-NWUO NO General Chaos looked really good when we got to check out a preview version of it a couple of months ago. Now we've got our hands on it, we're a little disappointed. The graphics are a little small, but they're well animated and there's a lot going on at any one time. Sound fits the mood; there's a lot of music and effects, although I've heard better elsewhere. The thing that puts me off General Chaos most is the actual gameplay, everything gets too muddled because of a poorly thought-out control system. With a four-player adaptor, things get better because you don't have to worry about taking charge of five fighters at the same time, but you frankly shouldn't have to fork out extra to make for a more playable version of the same game. MISS OK! HIT When you send in the lads for a brawl, you need to make sure you've chosen the right people for the job. In the barracks are four different squads, each suited to particular tasks. The assault squad consists of your general purpose troops, who can handle most situations competently, but without outstanding results. The demolition team, on the other hand, is essential if your mission requires you to destroy large amounts of enemy equipment. For specialist missions you have a team of two commandos, who are complete nutters capable of taking out enemy troops before they've realised what's going on. 68 GARTH SUMPTER 81 "

BOTH SEGA AND NINTENDO HAVE THEIR OWN PLATFORM lerror is gripping Third Earth! The world's supply of yarnballs is mysteriBASED HEROES BUBSY IS THE ONE CARRYING THE ously diminishing and there can be only ACCOLADE TORCH. one guilty party the Woolies. The Woolies' home planet of Rayon is under threat; you see, the story goes that Rayon's civilisation is powered solely by high fibre plasma engines which utilise yarnball superclusters at their core, so as you can imagine, the Woolies get through a rather large amount of yarnballs. So the Queens of Rayon, Polly and Esther have sent their armies to Earth to retrieve as many yarnballs as they can possibly carry, but there was one thing that the citizens of Rayon didn't count on Bubsy the Bobcat. Bubsy has the largest stash of yarnballs on earth, and you can bet he's goin to defend them with his life. The entire planet is depending on Bubsy pro tecting his beloved yarnballs good luck 604 THE ONE THAT EATS WITH ITS PAW STUCK IN THE CAN 36 8:57 WW Don't you love the fair mate? v10940 If Bubsy falls from a great height then you still have one line of defence to stop him from dying. By pushing the A button whilst in mid-air, Bubsy will glide gracefully to the ground. This method of control is also extremely useful for reaching loads of yarnballs all in one jump. If you run extremely fast! and then hit your jump button, you can glide in the air for absolutely ages and clear the largest of gaps. He's the best pussy in the world hurrah for Bubsy. 135 07:54 Aieee! 31  9:41 TOM Gorgeous backdrops eh? ON THE OTHER HAND 04760 SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2 There's nothing more annoying when you're playing a game than if you die and have to start from the very beginning again, but it's equally annoying when a game is so easy 'Cos you start from exactly the same place when you die. The answer is of course those wonderful things known as restart points. In Bubsy, the restart points are huge exclamation marks. Every time you go through one of these, you will start from that point again when you die. Hurrah for that eh? 84 If platforms are your thing, then you can't do any better than this. Sonic has speed unmatched by anything you've ever seen and the gameplay is marv. I'm sure you're all more than familiar with Sonic 2 so I won't go on too long, but it's a bit good, isn't it? 8:52 REVIEWED: CVG No 132 The old gags are the best. "


"TABBY 114520 MEGADRIVE Bubsy is a bit of a dangerous sort of moggy, but for those of you who are somewhat cautious and adhere to that lovely proverb of looking before you leap, Accolade have catered for you as well. By pushing the C button and pressing the joypad in any direction you can look ahead in that direction. This proves extremely handy when you have to jump onto tiny little platforms in the middle of a large chasm. You can't see that far along the screen, but it does give you a long enough view to see if there's anything dangerous in your path. TIET PROS: Marvellous fluid animation and great cartoony graphics. CONS: Repetitive gameplay spoils a potentially brilliant cart. 242 7.15 I fly through the air with the greatest of ease. VERDICT Hilarious cartoon graphics and some great expressions from Bubsy. While I don't think Bubsy's delivered quite the amount of brilliance Accolade would have liked, he's certainly done wonders for them. Graphically Bubsy is something of masterpiece; the Bobcat is brilliantly animated with loads of different expressions and actions. The only prob lies in the allimportant gameplay vault; it starts off quite playable bur becomes a touch repetitive; it's not too original, either. Bubsy's a good 'un, but long-term play is something of a chore. Try before you buy, as the man said. Run baby run. Horrible tunes but decent enough effects. PAUL ANGLIN to 9804 304 GAMEPLAY Becomes too repetitive too quickly. I like driving in my car. 450 SAD FOLK START HERE Hmm, so you can't even make it past Chapter 4 eh? That's not very good is it? I think you should stop playing Bubsy and go and sit in the cat litter tray, you'll probably blend better with the contents of that than you will with a bunch of gamesplayers. If you really do need help though, try simply slowing down a bit so you can see where you're going. You won't play it forever, but it's worth the cash. 90 9:22 What's he doing? STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES GINGER NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER GARTH Well, now you're starting to make some progress in collecting those yarnballs. You've got to be pretty awkward because the woolies are out in force now. Remember that if you want loads of points, bounce on as many baddies as you can in a row. ONWA IIIIIIIII 19 One of the more fun parts in Bubsy The Bobcat can be found in chapters 4, 5 & 6 it's the fabulous, marvellous, all-moving, all-dancing rolllercoaster! You can either run along the rolllercoaster tracks or jump in one of the cars. The advantage of jumping in the cars is that if you put Bubsy's arms in the air (you can do this by pushing up on the joypad), then you can grab the higher-up yarn balls that you wouldn't normally be able to grab. The only thing that you have to be careful of when using the rolllercoaster is that you have to jump out when the carriage reaches the end of the track, otherwise you'll end up as one flat cat! AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! MISS OK! HIT PAUL Hurrah! Now you're really motoring. If you've made it this far then you've really started to get the hang of controlling that Bobcat. There isn't really a massive amount more that I can tell you, but if you want to make sure you don't die, then at every jump use the look button to make sure everything is clear. 85 "


"LREVIEWSNESI by STORM .99 Get ready! SNES OUT: September. Contact Storm (071 585 3308) for information. h no! More Lemmings clones! This is yet another of those games in which you have to save the lives of terminal thickies by guiding them to an exit. You control Hokus, a wizard's apprentice who likes nothing better than to sit around all day on his butt reading comics. Naturally this really peeves his boss, who orders him to clean out the THE LATEST IN A LINE OF LEMMINGS-A-LIKES smelly cellar as punishment. While down there, he LOOKS A GOOD 'UN! comes across a packet of Troddlers, a race of tiny. incredibly dim, magical creatures. After tipping the packet into a bucket of water he finds himself surrounded by hundreds of them, with his master due back any moment. The choice is simple; get rid of all the Troddlers, or bend over for a good thrashing. Doesn't look at all like Lemmings, does it! No, of course not. Oh Mummy! This is a bit too high for me! I'm scared! BOTTLE-GLASS, GLASS-BOTTLE Hokus only knows one spell fortunately, it lets him create bricks out of thin air. These can be stacked on top of each other to create steps and block off potentially dangerous passages. Some blocks are already on the screen at the start of the level. These are usually the type you can't pick up, so the only way to move them is by pushing. This invariably leads to frustration as once a block is pushed up against a wall, there's no way to move it anywhere else should you need it. It's often wise to pause the game when you start a new level so you've got plenty of time to plan out your route. Blocks are also useful for crushing any of the creatures which turn up to cause him grief. One of the worst is the bird, which swoops down and destroys any blocks you've placed. Not only is this completely irritating, it usually results in several Troddlers coming to a rather surprised and sticky end. Wake up, you lazy so-and-so! There's Troddling to be done. HOKUS POKUS Usually Troddlers are quite passive; that is, until they go through until they go through a teleporter, and guess what? There just happened to be one lying around. Now they're trapped in another dimension, with many of their number transformed into homicidal nutters for some inexplicable reason. Because of their lack of brains and strange ability to cling to any surface, the Troddlers will walk in a straight line, up walls and across ceilings until they reach the exit, or are killed. Your job is to build bridges over the hazards to lead to them way out, while avoiding the various creatures which appear from time to time to make your life miserable. Life isn't always as simple as that. Some stages also require you to collect a set number of diamonds before the Troddlers reach the exit. In these cases it's usually best to trap the Troddlers in a corner of the screen to give yourself enough time to collect the gems and lay the necessary blocks to help them to freedom. 86 "


"THIS TIME IT'S WAR Stairway to heaven? This little feller doesn't think so! The two-player head-to-head game means megadeath for Troddlers. Now you're not just trying to get yours to safety, but eliminate all the opposition's as well. Should Troddlers from opposite teams come into contact with each other it's Goodnight Vienna as both explode in a shower of icky bits. Alternatively you can save on Troddlers by using bricks instead, although this isn't as fun as sending a dozen of the little guys on a suicide raid. If that's too violent for you there's a two-player team mode, where you help each other out. Although you get a different set of levels, it's not half as fun as the war mode. PROS: Loads of levels and an excellent two-player mode. ON THE OTHER HAND COLLECT AND SURVIVE KRUSTY'S SUPER FUN HOUSE CONS: Hardly the most original of concepts, although it's better than some Lemmings clones. Someone out there must like Hokus, because they keep dropping him loads of excellent items. These periodically float down from the top of the screen, but they only last a few seconds before they disappear. This is a Lemmings-alike with a different slant. Instead of saving creatures, you're trying to destry them. With guest appearances from the Simpsons, Krusty's Super Fun House is funny, violet and extremely taxing. Tiny sprites and some very dull colour schemes. REVIEWED: CVG No128 CLOCK: Adds one minute to the timer. Grab the lemon! Unless you don't want to, of course.. HEART: Restores energy Above average tunes and not much else. DIAMONDS: You have to collect all the diamonds before you finish a stage. Seen it all before, but still fun. SHIELD: Temporary invincibility BOMB Wipes out every enemy Troddler on the screen. 101011 GAMEPLAY 0001400 FIVEBLOCKS: Adds five bricks to your supply VALUE Three different game modes and plenty of levels to beat. SPACED OUT STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES FRUIT: Restores half your energy Zombified Troddlers have to be dealt with as soon as they appear, otherwise they home in on yours and kill them. The only way to get rid of them is by dropping blocks on their heads, thus ending their undead reign of terror. You can't afford to use too many bricks though, as you only have a limited supply. Some of the tougher levels start you off with none at all, so in addition to saving the Troddlers, there's the added task of rushing around collecting blocks. Things are getting a bit tight, this is no time to sleep on the job! IIIIIIIIII| VERDICT ONWUO NO TUTTI TID MISSIOK HIT Flipping heck, another not-at-all-like-Lemmings game! This particular one is better than most. Although each level is only one screen big, plenty of planning needs to go into devising a route for the Troddlers to take. The head-to-head mode is excellent, although the co-operation game is dull and you invariably end up shouting at your partner when he mucks things up. Hardly the most original game ever, and not as fun as Krusty's Fun House, but if you're a complete weirdo who's obsessed with this type of game, you could do worse than tackle The Troddlers. 85 STEVE KEEN 87 "

You start with a measly $1000, but as the games start off with a $250 limit, it's impossible to blow all your cash in one go.

"CHEAT RYU That with the brilliance of Streetfighter II Turbo paraded in this very issue, we thought it would be a good idea to let loose our very own Streetfighter II expert and general gamesplaying wizard, Paul Anglin, with a Super Nintendo and a cart After figuring out that he couldn't play his offensively loud music on the thing, he sat down and came up with the following two pages of Streetfighter Turbo wonderness... Ryu may not have much of a life but he remains as focused as ever on his fighting abilities and forsakes everything else; he has also fallen out with his original sparring partner ken. This does mean, however, that Ryu's fighting skills are more than impressive and his blows are all measured perfectly, so watch out. KEN SPECIAL MOVES Due to having the same moves, Ken is still essentially the same character as Ryu, although he's still a bit harder. Whereas Ryu is completely focused on the task in hand and tends to take time to measure his blows, Ken is more of a maniac and dives in there fists flying. His aggressiveness gives him the slight edge over Ryu, but he is more prone to counter attacks than his Japanese counterpart. BLANKA BALROG Ryu's Dragon Punch summons up the power of the Dragon to completely level an opponent; to use it, press right, down and diagonally down and right and punch. His flame ball of death moves slowly, but is still enough to catch napping opponents. To perform it push down, diagonally down and right and right and punch. The sheer speed of Ryu's Hurricane Kick is enough to overwhelm opponents, it will literally pummel them with dozens of kicks. To use it push down, diagonally down and left, left and then kick. SPECIAL MOVES Ken's special moves are exactly the same as Ryu's (surprise, that) and they're performed in exactly the same way. Blanka is quite possibly the most intense combatant in the entire tournament. His incredible speed and relentless attacks make him extremely dangerous, so make sure he doesn't hear you calling him monkey boy. The problem with beating Blanka is that he seems to have everything; lightning fast speed, incredible strength, great moves and an completely unmatched level of ferocity. He may ponce about with his hair, but Balrog is certainly a major force. Balrog started his career in Bullfighting, but he tired of just having to dodge out the way of the bulls and decided he wanted something a little more challenging. Balrog sports a rather nasty knifed glove which he uses to slice and dice his opponents. His speed is his biggest weapon. M.BISON SPECIAL MOVES SPECIAL MOVES SPECIAL MOVES The Vegas boxer is very hard. In America and Europe they thought that M Bison sounded too much like Mike Tyson, so the names of the four bosses were changed. Bison has entered the tournament 'cos he's deemed too brutal and unorthodox for normal rules of boxing; unfortunately for anyone who has to face him, Bison has lost none of his incredible punching power. If you're on the receiving end of one of his dashing punches, there's not much chance of you getting up off the deck. Bison has two very hard punches. The Dashing Uppercut is when Bison steps back from his opponent, runs forward and gives him a real whack in the gob. Just press away from your opponent then towards him and punch. The Dashing Straight Punch is the same as the Uppercut, but is a straight punch. Justs do exactly the same as the Uppercut but use middle punch instead. Rolling attack: Blanka will curl into a ball and spin in to his opponent at great speed. To execute this press away from your opponent (hold this for about two seconds), then push towards your opponent and press punch. Electricity: Blanka's body will become covered in electricity making it impossible for anyone to touch him, those that do will be fried alive. To use this rapidly tap the punch buttons. Balrog's special moves involve his very nasty sharp glove. The flamboyant IBN drop has Balrog climbing the fence that protects the crowd from the action and leaping onto his foe fist first. To use this press down, then up and kick. Balrog's other special move happens when he's in the Rolling Crystal Flash mood. He rolls along the floor and lunges at his opponent. To use, press away from your opponent then towards and punch. 96 "


"VEGA GUILE SPECIAL MOVES He may be a Dan Dare lookalike, but he's extremely hard. Vega's a pupil of the extremely violent, and mysterious skills of the Shadow. Little is known about this ancient art as it's been hidden from the known world. However, Vega intends parading it to the world in truly violent style. This guy has absolutely everything; he's very fast, very strong and shows no mercy, Guile's in this comp to avenge the death of his friend Charlie who was viciously murdered by Vega. (Who you may remember also killed Chun Li's Father). Guile's burning ambition is to stomp Vega into the ground once and for all. Guile uses a form of combat known as Special Forces Karate which is a bit hard and scary really. Guile's forte is his strength and brilliant combos get on the wrong side of this guy and you'll be out of the competition before you can blink. DHALSIN By whipping his arms through the air Guile can produce a Sonic Boom which hits an opponent with great speed. Hold away from your opponent, then towards and any punch button. The Flash Kick involves a rather impressive back somersault and kick creating an impenetrable wall of energy that will knock an opponent flat on contact. Hold down, push down, up and kick. SPECIAL MOVES Mr Tandoori is the tournament's second weirdest combatant in the tournament (first place has to go to Blanka on that score) By using ancient methods of Yoga and other such stuff, Dhalsim can manipulate his body to give himself a far greater reach and take out opponents at the other end of the screen. Dhalsim is a very laid back fighter; he's quite happy to let you keep jumping towards him while he peppers you with long range blows. ZANGIEF SPECIAL MOVES SPECIAL MOVES Vega's special moves are worlds apart from anything you've seen before. His Psycho Crusher is the ultimate in fireball moves. By using all his Shadow knowledge Vega creates a shield of energy around his body and launches himself towards his opponent. If you get caught by this, forget it! To use it just press away from your opponent then towards and punch. The Flying Head Press is hard to block due to its unusualness. He jumps into the air, comes down on his opponents head, and catches him with an unsuspecting fist. To pull this off, push down, then up and punch. Lastly is Vega's nasty Double Knee Jerk where Vega goes flying in with kicks all over the place. Time it right, and you perform a three or four-hit combo. To use, press away from your opponent, then towards and kick The rather large Russkie is probably the biggest lad in the tourament. Zangief made an appearance in the comp for a very simple reason, to kick ass! Being the size he is, Zangief's main attack weapon is his sheer power, and there are'nt many that sample it and have much of a face left afterwards. If you try to get close to this gut for a throw he'll simly grab you and pound you so you're better off keeping your distance and using your jumping attacks. Zangief's most devastating move is his Spinning Pile Driver. This involves him grabbing his opponents and launching himself into the air with a little twist. Get caught by this and you'll wind up a permanent part of the ground! To perform the Spinning Pile Driver, grab your opponent and rotate the joypad through 360 degrees and press punch. Dhalsim's special moves consist of him spitting lots of fire all over the place (now you know why he's called the Tandoori man). The Yoga Flame is first on the list; this allows Dhalsim to create a shield of flame and protect himself from enemies. To perform this press down, diagonally down and right, right and punch. The Yoga Fire is pretty much the same as the Yoga Flame but instead of a shield of flame Dhalsim spits a fireball at his opponents. To perform this press down, diagonally down and right, right and punch. CHUN LI SPECIAL MOVES E.HONDA Chun Li has entered the tournament to seek revenge on Vega, the man who callously murdered her father. Her stunning looks and remarkable agility make her a formidable foe, and she has the advantage of being somewhat under-estimated by her opponents; after all, you don't think they'd be scared of a girl do you? SPECIAL MOVES The Hundred Foot Kick is easy to use simply hit the kick buttons rapidly. The Spinning Bird Kick has Chun Li spinning upside down in mid-air, thwacking opponents with her legs. Hold down, press up and kick. SAGAT SPECIAL MOVES Being something of a dab hand at the ancient art of Sumo, fatboy hasn't bothered himself with the Jenny Craig diet. His weight is his greatest asset and he uses it to great effect. His reason for entering the compo was that when he won the title of Yokozuna (that's Grand Champion to the non Japanese amongst us) everyone and their mum mocked his sad skills saying that Sumo was not a force to be reckoned with (we all knew that anyway). In a rage of anger, Honda entered the comp to prove the superiority of Sumo to the rest of the world, although reckon he's fighting a losing battle myself. The Hundred Hand Slap is the easiest of Honda's moves to pull off. This sees fat old Honda punching his opponents so rapidly that his hand becomes but a blur and his opponents become but a flibbling mess. To use the Hundred Hand Slap, simply hit the punch buttons rapidly. Using the immense strength in his oil rig-esque legs, Honda launches himself head first at his opponents. The advantage of this move is that, even if it is blocked, it leaves you close enough to your opponent to get him in the bear hug. To perform it, press away from your opponent then towards and punch. Sagat always thought he was a bit hard, but Ryu put him right score. Now Sagat is a touch peeved. Sagat's reason for entering the tournament are twofold; to teach Ryu a lesson and reclaim the title of the world Streetfighter Champion. His advantages are his incredible strength and speed he is an exponent of the art of Thai boxing which is a bit violent. The Tiger Uppercut starts Segat crouched before jumping into the air with arms extended. To perform it do exactly as you do with Ryu's Dragon Punch. The Tiger shot is essentially a fireball but it's faster, smaller and harder to dodge; to use this simply do the same as Ryu's fireball. 97 "


"CHEAT DE GOAL! o you've ran out and bought your copy of the most excellent Goal!, and you still can't beat the dribbly divisions because you just can't seem to get to grips with the controls and play strategies? Never fear, 'cos CVG is here to give you the lowdown on just how to do the biz with the round, plastic thing! CONTROLLING THE BALL THE SLIDE THE TRAP THE STOP To trap the ball hold the fire button and touch the ball and you will bring the ball under control leaving you free to pass to any of your team mates. This is a great move for shaking off players who are running with you. When you make contact with the ball simply centre the joystick and your player will stop the ball leaving him free to run off in a new direction. In order to retrieve the ball from an opponent simply tap fire before you reach the ball and you will slide in. If your player is running slow enough then you will also control the ball when you make contact with it. THE TURN TRAP THE CHEST DOWN THE HEADER Whilst this is essentially the same as the basic trap, it does give you the advantage of being able to pull the ball back a little as well as trapping it. This is useful for stopping the ball crossing the line or taking it away from a player when he slides in to tackle you. To perform this, as soon as the player starts controlling the ball, turn the player away from the line, or the advancing player. To control the ball with your chest simply face the ball when it is at chest height and you will automatically chest it down. However, if you are facing away from the ball it will cannon off you and go off in any number of directions. To head the ball just tap the fire button while the ball is in the air. When you are in the air, you can change the direction that the ball travels in. One thing that you must remember is that your own speed and direction will affect the direction and power of the header. To make your player head the ball down, hold down the fire button until the player heads the ball. 98 "


"DRIBBLING PASSING TACKLING THE CLOSE DRIBBLE THE STOP TURN THE CONTROLLED THE BLOCK TACKLE This is a fail-safe tackle that cannot result in a foul, no matter how inept the ref. You simply stand in his way and take the ball off him. When the ball is at your feet just push the joystick in the direction that you wish to go. As long as you don't go too fast, the ball will stay at your feet. If you start travelling too quickly then simply centre the joystick and you will slow down. This method for slowing down is dead helpful when lining up a shot at goal but you must be careful because the slower you go, the easier you are to tackle. This is very similar to the Trap Turn but is more difficult to pull off. If you centre the joystick as you reach the ball, you can stop the ball without using the fire button. This has to be timed very carefully to pull it off successfully. If you are travelling slow enough you can turn the ball through 180 degrees to really shake off your man-toman marker. THE SLIDE TACKLE Other than the Wimbledon supporters amongst you, I'm sure you all know that good passing is essential to good football. The easiest way to pass in Goal! is to use the controlled pass. Firstly control the ball using the trap technique. Then whilst holding down the fire button, turn your player in the direction you wish to pass. Keeping the joystick in your chosen direction, release the fire button and the ball will fly off towards your nearest team mate. The quality of the pass is dependent solely on the skill of the player making the pass. THE TRAP TURN THE FAST TURN This is the most effective tackle, and is also a bit dangerous if mistimed. To perform a sliding tackle tap the fire button when the ball is low. Your player will then slide in the direction he is facing. You must be careful to make contact with the ball before the player otherwise this will result in a foul, but then you all know that already. THE THROUGH BALL Turning with the ball at speed is a brilliant way to shake off defenders and get a clean shot at goal. 1) Hold the fire button down and touch the ball. 2) Centre the joystick to slow yourself down. 3) Release the fire button. 4) Run off in a new direction. This is one of the more difficult techniques to master. It allows you to perform 45 degree turns at high speed, but it is extremely difficult to perform. This is just a matter of precision timing. It's the same as the trap turn but you must choose exactly the right time to change the joystick direction. This is very useful when you're running towards the penalty area from one of the wings. THE INTERCEPTION If you bring your player to a stop while the ball is slightly away from your feet during a dribble the ball will run through to another player. THE STAGGER TURN THE CHIP PASS The most effective way to take the ball off an opponent is to intercept it before it even gets to him. You can do this running normally or by sliding in. Remember that when using the sliding tackle, if you are not travelling too fast, you will be able to control the ball as well. You have to change direction just after kicking the ball ahead, so that you can come at the ball from a different angle. It gives you similar speed advantages to the fast dribble but is more flexible. To chip the ball over defenders, simply reverse the joystick when in contact with it. This will put the ball high enough to clear the heads of defenders. After you have played the chip, you can alter its height and swerve by use of the joystick (see aftertouch for more info). This move is useful for short crosses or playing a ball through to a runner from midfield over the defence. THE BLOCK DEFENCE SHOOTING THE SUPER SHOT THE OVERHEAD KICK THE LONG The easiest way to keep an opponent from tackling you is to keep your back to him and shield the ball so he can't get to it. When you trap the ball just turn away from any advancing players. However, it will only be a certain amount of time before you are tripped up so you can only do it for a certain amount of time. If you are within nine yards of the centre of the goal, tapping the fire button will result in a Super Shot. A Super Shot is a shot that is calculated by the computer to put the ball cleanly past the keeper. You don't even need to aim or set a direction provided you are close enough to the goal. The quality of the Super Shot will depend on the skill of the player. Also known as a bicycle kick, an overhead kick can be attempted when the ball is at head height. Overhead kicks are extremely deceiving to the unsuspecting keeper and are usually very powerful. To perform simply reverse the joystick while the ball is in the air. The only difficulty with this shot is that it has to be timed to perfection. Also known as the Graham Failure tactic, this is quite an effective method for catching out napping defenders. The Long Ball is simply a shot with swerve. To shoot the ball, simply tap the fire button when in contact with the ball. 99 "

"Dear YOB, This is just a message for all those readers who think they're hard because they write to you with a really cheesy insult or compliment and then demand you answer their questions: YOU ARE NOT FUNNY. DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL YOU STUPID GITS. STEPHEN BOWERS Pontefract, Yorks. YOB: He may be boring, but he's right. UGGGHHHHHH! What's this smelly old turd gently whiffing in the corner? It's YOB'S MAILBAG, stuffed to the brim with the literary sewage you lot insist on sending! Yes indeed, welcome to another double dose of the lousiest letters page in the known universe, in which your pale and pathetic excuses for humour are put down with my customary wit, charm and sophistication. So, if you think you're up to the standards set on these pages, fancy having a bit of a go or just want to know about games, drop a line to the Almighty Answerer at: YOB'S HYPERVENTILATINGLY HILARIOUS MAILBAG, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU. Remember, there's a staggering ONE HUNDRED POUNDS for the best letter of the lot and a wet kipper's fart for everything else... 102 A CHURCH TOWER Dear YOBBO, Oh sorry, it's YOB isn't it? (It's going to be one of those days YOB) Anyway, I wrote in to complain about YOB's Mailbag completely craping up CVG. I can't decide if you're sad or really sad. You're to sad to tell the difference anyway. You sound like the type of guy who laughs at Bob Monkhouse jokes.Looking at your portrait you must be one ugly git! I bet you won't print this letter you constipated YOBBO. Oh sorry, it's YOB isn't it? DC London W2 YOB: Just for once, the back of this \"letter\" was more interesting than the front, and I quote: «Bed sofas are already provided with wooden grid. In case of base and cushions of different fabric categories, the higher one has to be considered.» Which all makes a lot more sense than anything on the other side. Look DC, whatever you do don't worry. If you bang on the cage door long enough I'm sure you'll eventually get a banana. "


"TWO BLOCKS OF FLATS THREE AERIALS Dear YOB, Tve just designed a new game called Streetfighter All-Stars Edition which features the world's most famous film stars including: Bruce Lee as Ryu, Jean Claude Van Damme as Ken, Arnie as Zangief (sort of), Dolph Lundgren as Guile, China O'Brien as Chun Li (Phwooar!), Cyril Smith as E Honda, Bill Odie as Blanka and Michael Jackson as Dhalsim (think about it.) The bosses are: Sylvester Stallone as Balrog (after a 10-stone weight gain), Tony Slattery as Vega (?YOB), Chuck Norris as Sagat and Paul Daniels as Bison. Funny thing is, I've had no offers. Oh well, c'est la vie. WAYNE BROWN Ulverston, Cumbria. YOB:You're too late. It's already been superseded by Streetfighter Turdo, which features the world's saddest people including: Wayne Brown as Saddo, Wayne Brown as Sad Wayne, Wayne Brown as Wayne Sadness and Wayne Brown as Wayne Brown. In this special Turdo Edition nobody actually fights anybody because they're all a bit pathetic and do live in Ulverston after all. Dear YOB, Is Thora Hird your well-known bird? Questions: 1. Why is CVG so brilliant? 2. Why are you so crap at putdowns? 3. Why do teachers always have bad breath? Three wonders of the world, I reckon. Oh ( 1 ) yes, you know Gamesmaster: is he your dad 'cos you look just like him bald, old and talks like a puff? GARY CHAMBERS Pescadero Mental Hospital, Nottingham. PS I don't know why I wrote this letter because you won't print it. Actually I love your bit and reckon that you pay for YOB's Mailbag and get CVG free. Sorry if there's a lot With ... of mistakes it's because I've broken my arm and the doctor's put wires in it. So sorry. YOB: I'm sorry to disappoint you, but those aren't wires in your arm at all. They're restraining straps, holding you to the chair. The wires you mention actually lead to that big heavy thing on your head and that bloke in the white coat isn't a doctor at all. You see that big lever he's about to pull down? That's for you... SOME SORT OF PORTALOO Dear YOB, I am the best Megadrive player in the world, so answer these questions you useless little crab. 1. When is Streetfighter 2 coming OUT? 2. When will the sequel come OUT? 3. Which is best: Sonic 2 or the European Cup Games? 4. Why do YOU always insult people? 5. Is your real name Mark, because Peter says so. STEVEN SMILE Bristol it's not even in the arcades yet you bozo. 3. Depends. Some of the England games are right cack but West Germany are a bit of alright. Still, I think football in general is a load of old turkey vomit so Sonic 2 wins every time because the cartridge is no better than the sad and rather silly game itself. 4. Because I'm the Prince of the Putdown, King of the Swingers and greatest geezer in town. 5. Peter is a prat. A SMELLY OLD DRAINPIPE Dear YOB, I have some questions. I'll keep them short. 1. Megadrive and Mega-CD 2. Compatible? 2. Megadrive 2 and Mega-CD. Compatible? 3. You. The business? JAMES PORTER Croydon, Surrey. YOB: 1. YES! 2. YES! 3. Why bother to ask? A LOT OF PIGEON CACK YOB, I'm not going to bother to say 'Dear' like all the other lik-ups that write in to you the Brainless Wheesle because I think you are as good as anything that comes out of my rear end and have a brain the size of a frozen pea which is not much good that's for sure. Your taking the mick is about as good as Open University if you've ever seen it. Doh! As you are there, better try to answer my questions or else I'll be back. 1. When was the last time you took a bath? 2. How much will the SNES CD cost? 3. Is it true that the British SNES may blow if you put converters in? 4. Is the game Alien v Predator any good? KAMRAN VOJDANI Essex, Harlow. YOB: 1. If you mean on Megadrive, September. Yes it will be Champion Edition complete with controllable bosses and no it won't include some of the features of Turbo. Are you lot finally happy NOW? 2. If you mean Turbo, probably never. I'm not sure the Megadrive could handle the speed. If you mean SF3, YOB: 1. The last time I tried to take a bath Victoria was on the throne, so she was clogging up the bathroom and couldn't get in? 2. No details or price yet. 3. Only if you have a brain the size of a half-eaten marshmallow and try to shove it in the wrong way round. 4. Only if you're so ridiculously thick that you think Essex is in Harlow and that Vojdani is a sensible surname. Have you ever considered shoving steroids into your ears in a last-ditch attempt to bolster your brain? Dear YOB, Don't your dare chuck my letter in the bin or... MARK FELL Leeds YOB: Sorry. 103 "


"noooops ww RESERVOIR DOGS Dear YOB, In The Beginning there was void. Our lives were lost and meaningless and the spirit of God was moving over London. m And then God commanded: \"Let there be CVG!\" and CVG appeared. God was pleased with what he saw, the first day. And then God said: \"Let there be brilliant and funny game reviews\" and there was. God was pleased with what he saw, the second day. And then God said: Let all the latest News and Reviews be in one place and separated from the crap.\" And it was done. Then he commanded: \"Let all the brilliant dudes work to produce this mag.\" And it was done. God was pleased with what he saw, the third day. And then God said: \"Let CVG give away a free hand-held magazine with every issue.\" And it was done. God was pleased with what he saw, the fourth day. And then God said: Let there be an official Top Ten games and High Score table in every issue.\" And it was done. God was pleased with what he saw, the fifth day. And then God said: \"Let there be YOB! I will put him in command over CVG and the entire earth.\" And it was done. God was very pleased with what he saw, the sixth day. And that is how God created the galaxy, and filled our lives with purpose and meaning. ISAIAH Adelaide, South Australia muebles Fizz BEER SVRE YOB: And on the seventh day, God said: \"Let there be a continent full of beautiful, intelligent, brave and strong people who know how to tell a good joke, wear cool clothes and contribute something worthwhile to the world.\" But he was so tired he bodged it up completely. And that is how he created Australia, and filled our lives with brain-dead sheep farmers and crappy beer. DOESN'T PLAY THE GAME, PLAYS THE GAMES (YES! Dear YOB, How could the CVG review lads give Starwing 96 per cent? The game is rubbish. The lads rated the graphics 96 per cent. Compare them to Strike Commander or Comanche Maximum Overkill and they are rubbish. The graphics in Starwing are as good as Elite's when it came out on the Acorn BBC computer at least five years ago. The game really looks dated. Compare the planes, vehicles and ships! Compare Starwing's graphics to most games on any computer or console. They look rubbish. The gameplay is not very good at OF COURSE 2 all. In fact it's crap. The game is not worth even . I do know what I am talking about HE ONLY KNOWS because I have had computers over ten years and I have seen the change in graphics. Starwing's look as if they were done in the early 80s. Having said that, CVG THIS COS HE READ IT is not a bad magazine and I've been reading it ever since issue 1 which we have a IN THE TENTH copy of. Except for about four issues we have every other one. The very first CVG was ANNIVERSARY ISSVE! November 1981 priced 75p and had three robot-like creatures with light beams coming out of their eyes on the cover. Inside were programs for the Apple Il systems with Super Nim, Rainbow Passage on Vic 20, The Nibblers on a 32-column Pet in 8K by Paul Jay and many more. Do you think the first issue is very rare and are there many left? E BUCKLEY Markfield, Leicester mvh YOB: Right, before this letter got all sad and nostalgic it did have a bit of a point. When Starwing was launched, the people who bought it broadly fell into two groups: people who though it was brilliant and people who thought it was cack. Funnily enough, nobody just thought it was OK. I've had a lot of letters from people asking me to finally put the case to rest by answering the burning question: \"Is Starwing cack or not?\" Well, let's put it this way: right now Sega are touting Silpheed as one of the best reasons to buy a Mega-CD. I've played them both, and Starwing wins because it's more playable, has a better storyline, more impressive graphics and quite a lot of variety. It's one of those games you're either going to love or hate, and obviously the reviewers loved it. But just like all the games we review here at CVG, you have to decide for yourself whether it's the type of game for you. For example, we can review a baseball game and tell you it's brilliant, but if you don't like baseball you're not going to have a good time, no matter how good the cart is. If you're a fan of 3D shooters with fast action, lots of explosions and not too much depth you won't go far wrong with Starwing. However, if you're looking for real depth and challenge these are things the SFX chip cannot improve, however hard it tries. As to your question on CVG Issue One it's worth about  now: provided you still have the free  note we gave away on the cover. 104 "

Anyway, here's what you must do. When you're flying through the asteroid belt you'll come across a series of three spinning columns of grey boulders with an orange one in the middle. Blast all the orange ones and stay on course (because you have to fly through the orange debris). Now, just to the left you'll spot an asteroid with a face on it turn your guns toward this and blast as many times as you can until the Black Hole level appears. Now just fly into it and you're there. You're also correct when you say that there are other levels to be found, but you should have read my super Starwing guide in CVG to find out just where they are!

Which is bad news for up to the festive season. And in grand beach bums, but good news for softCVG tradition, some of those big guns ware fans, as it also heralds the end of get the wraps taken off them right here, the traditional Summer slump. With right now... Autumn and, dare we say it, Christmas PREVIEWS in the race for the Christmas number one The idea behind the game is simple enough; it turns out that Skynet and the Terminator machines that wiped out mankind in the year 1997 were a direct spin-off of Robocop's revolutionary circuitry. A rebel from the future travels back in time to warn Robo of what will happen, hotly pursued by a whole squadron of Terminators who want to wipe him out before he can change the future. So begins the metallic punch-up of the century as Robo battles his way through Delta City, present and future, taking on everything from street hoods to the unstoppable Terminators along the treacherous route. There are hostages to be rescued and plenty of big, beefy weapons to collect which takes us onto one of the game's most impressive aspects, its excessive violence. The baddies literally explode into a bloodied mass when they're shot, so there's no end to the gore something that probably won't be a feature of the SNES version, given Nintendo's strict software policy. Robocop versus The Terminator is looking like one of the hottest blasts of 1993, sporting a funky futuristic soundtrack and plenty of sampled Robo-speech. Keep an eye out for this one... Ominous landscape or what?! ROBOCOP VERSUS TERMINATOR  MEGADRIVE. VIRGIN  TBA Take him out fast! ased on the highly unlikely, but very successful Dark Horse comic, Virgin's latest shoot 'em up epic is one of two versions in production the Super NES format is being handled by Interplay, but they're pretty much identical. This one's due for release in November, which makes it Virgin's front-runner THE TERMINATOR  MEGA-CD VIRGIN. TBA mated sequences from the film. New levels include the Dead City, Waste Land, Sky Net base, Time Chamber and Tech Noir Bar. The CD version should be released some time near the end of this year and from what we've seen a Christmas number one is not that much of a remote prospect! 08039 It looks like there's no end to the mileage that the software houses can get out of this boy! The beefy bad lad of the future is back with possibly his most impressive game yet seen on console. Future boy Kyle Reese has come back to the year 1984 to protect the future mother of the leader of the Earth resistance against the all-conquering machines. Set to the backdrops of futuristic and present day Los Angeles, Reese must fend off everything that the city and machines can throw at him as well as going up against the Terminator. The Megadrive version was one of the best-selling carts of last year and Virgin Games have taken that and turned the game upside down. The Mega-CD version features more hardware, larger and more varied baddies, more levels and a mindblowing CD soundtrack!

The roads fork, split and throw up loads of different junctions and it's up to you to decide which route will be the fastest and best to take. There are twelve demon roadsters to choose from as you tear up the countries roads and highways, with six cars for each continent. The GTI is a fave, as is the Astra and Ford Fiesta. Other more exotic machines can be chosen by the middle aged, such as Corvettes and Pontiac Firebird Formulas! Each motor has its own specs on speed, fuel consumption, acceleration etc, so choose wisely. Win a race and the cash will roll in, but don't go blowing all on sweets and fizzy pop too soon. If you want to continue racing and keeping up with the big boys you're advised to splash out on better tyres, fluffy dice or ABS brakes in the motor shop!

There are no rules to this car crashing championship as competitors enter into the illegal underground world of cut-throats and cowboys as they pit their machines against the best that the rest of the racing circuit has to offer! Racing takes place over six checkpoints in each continent. The European leg takes players through every hairpin turn and bend that London, Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Scotland and Amsterdam have to offer. On the other hand, drivers can pit their skills against the hard flat tracks of New York, Mount Rushmore, Los Angeles, Florida, Washington and Las Vegas. Each point in every city has to be reached for the next location and destination Pass the Kleenex, there's a bogey on your tail! icroprose's hugely successful combat flight sim, F-15 Strike Eagle II, will be scorching a path to a Megadrive near you very shortly. The cart puts you in the cockpit of one of the planet's most powerful jet fighters and takes you through the battle-scored terrain of some of the world's hottest hot spots! Combat takes place over six accurately mapped world areas and pilots are required to navigate over accurately mapped and detailed terrain before engaging enemy forces. Top Gun fighters will be taking on enemy militaria in Europe, the Gulf, the Middle East, Vietnam, Libya and the Arctic Circle. The computer version varied in speed due to the size of particular machines, but the console version runs at a blistering pace and the extraordinary graphical detail and 3D combat maintains a constant pace for every mission. Realism is the key to Strike Eagle's success and due to the fact that the Megadrive hasn't got a keyboard the cart has had to be extensively tweaked to provide the most realistic options for pilots to control. You can dive, roll, loop the loop, spin and dogfight enemy aircraft and perform most of the acrobatics available to the real Strike Eagle fighter pilots. Strike Eagle 2 is the most ambitious flight sim ever put on cartridge and a spectacular review of the game is imminent! Who's that hog spoiling the wide open roads?

This tactic has bought the world's super powers to their knees and only you can save the planet from slipping into the murderers' hands! Yes, Choplifter 2 was a blast, but the sequel promises to be even better with more weapons, more ! enemies and even bigger explosions! You can blast absolutely everything you can see on the screen to smithereens: backgrounds, trees, hills, everything! The super sequel chopper is equipped with flame throwers, machine guns and napalm and the new attack craft is going to need them all.

Most are hidden inside complexes, but a few roam free waving at you to pick them up. At least two new pick-ups will be available on every level, that makes for a sack full of new features! Apart from ground based ones a Hercules plane flies overhead and drops extra power-ups etc by parachute. As well as the different weapons the 'copter's performance can be boosted by obtaining shields, stealth invisibility, ropes and turbo jets! Awesome! Between the separate game sections the story is constantly updated with slick cinema sequences which fuel the atmospheric gameplay. Super Choplifter III looks set to be one of the biggest games of the year and what with its prequel's success a number one hit is virtually assured. Tune in next month to find out all the info!

"99 PAIN SPLATTER MUTILATION Zombies Ate My Neighbours may look all blood and bullets on the face of it, but there's a deeper level of gameplay bubbling away under the surface. Most levels are set out like a maze, so getting to the hapless humans before the zombies do often requires more than the on-screen radar the game gives you. There's some arcade adventure skill required, along with some ingenuity to make use of the many background objects. The trampolines in the garden on level one, for example, can be jumped on to bounce over hedges and walls, for example. Don't check out at the checkouts! The Hedgerow Chainsaw Massacre. Night terrors! 99 Our hero is chased by zombie clones in New Dead Kids on the Block. KILL GOUGE FLESH As is always the case, Zombies Ate My Neighbours is best enjoyed as a simultaneous two-player experience, with Zeke and Julie teaming up on-screen to fight the undead. It also leads to plenty of squabbles for pick-ups and bonuses, as anyone who's played a Gauntlet-style game will be more than familiar with. Complete with spooky soundtrack and no end of smart touches from the movie genre, Zombies Ate My Neighbours (the game was originally known simply as Monsters, by the way) is due out on Megadrive and Super NES in October. Bar some minor colour palette and sound differences, both versions are more or less identical, although there are no plans yet for conversions to other formats. The pyramid of fear. WERE 199 99 10 Don't slip up in the Castle of Dr. Tongue. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? GRAPHICS Most of the work on Zombies Ate My Neighbours has already been completed, but there are always fine tweaks and changes to be made right up until the last minute. Currently, the in-game sprites and backdrops have been finalised, but there is still some work to be done on the presentation side title screens, in-between graphics and so on. Dawn of the Dead revisited in the zombie department store. MAIM CHAINSAW HORROR Most of the skill you'll need, though, revolves around keeping yourself alive. There's a never-ending supply of zombies to deal with, along with special enemies for each level. You'll encounter bloodsucking mummies on the Egyptian level, giant ants and the scariest ones we've seen), chainsaw-weilding maniacs who can cut through walls to get to you! Your water-pistol is little use against these big baddies, but there are plenty of upgrades available, from three-way machine pistols to ice guns that freeze anything they hit. There are also plenty of secret points bonuses for those who know where to look and (best of all) special potions that can transform you into a \"super beast\" for a limited time and give the zombies a taste of their own medicine! 993 SOUND Zombies promises to be an astounding aural experience more so on the Super NES, which has a beefier sound chip than the Megadrive. Although this is usually the last part of a game to be added, the Zombies sound is already 100% complete, so even on our preview version the sounds were completely up to scratch. GAMEPLAY All the game's level designs have been finalised, with baddies, pick-ups and bonuses all in their proper places. But thorough bug-testing remains, as you never know when a misplaced power-up or enemy could unbalance the subtle gameplay blend. But again, on our preview version everything was hunky dory. 113 "
