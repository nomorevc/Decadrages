"ABF PROGRAMMABLE JOYSTICK TO 32.95 INTERFACE MICRODRIVE COMPATIBLE ONLY 32.95 +x90pp for Spectrum or ZX81 ABOUT OUR INTERFACE The AGF Programmable Joystick Interface is a unique design offering the use of any Ataricompatible joystick with absolutely all software, whether it is cassette or ROM cart ridge, with the Sinclair Spectrum or ZX81. The hardware programmable interface requires no additional software and accurately replicates the keys of the computer in a manner which is responsive to absolutely ALL key reading methods, both BASIC and Machine Code. The interface does not interfere with key operation and can therefore be used simul taneously with the keyboard. There is no need to remove the interface once fitted as the rear extension connector will accommodate further expansion, le printers or RAM packs etc. This important feature avoids excessive wear to the expansion port. The key replication principle pioneered by AGF means that your own programs can use eight directional joystick movement by utilising simple key reading BASIC. Two joystick sockets are provided which share the same keys, for use with the majority of two player games. Several interfaces may be used on the same computer for multiple joystick applications. The interface is programmed by a two digit code, which is looked up on a programming chart supplied, for each direction and firing button. The two numbers are then selected on a pair of leads which are clipped onto appropriately numbered strips on the interface. Once configured this can be marked on a Quick Reference Programming Card for storing with the game. As the programming is nor power dependent the interface retains the last configuration made and can be immediately used when next switched on. FROM: MR/MRS/MISS ADDRESS ADDRESS PACKAGE CONTENTS SUPPLIED  Programmable Interface Module as illus trated, complete with clip-on programming leads. Self adhesive programming chart detailing how to define which key is simulated by UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and FIRE. This can be fixed on to the case of your computer or if preferred the protective backing can be left on. The chart is made of a very durable reverse printed plastic and is extremely easy to read. One pack of ten Quick Reference Programming Cards for at-a-glance setting to your games requirements. The card allows you to mark the configuration in an easy to read fashion with space to record the software title and company name.

"MORE PROFESSIONAL BUGS! When the Dragon PEEKS locations 341-344 it looks for a value of 223 to register an arrow key. The TRS 80 though, uses 247. You can alter Fox and Hounds from August's issue to run on a Tandy Colour computer by changing lines 620 to 650. Change the 223 in the brackets to a 247. Thanks go to D. Healey for this. (No not that D. Healey.) SPEC-SCROLL Paul Jennison of Hull sent me a useful tip for Spectrum owners. Although there is no command in Basic to scroll the Yet again, I've heard of more bugs appearing in so-called professional software. It may be that a single batch of these cassettes are faulty, or perhaps there really is a bug in the sequel to Ultimate's Jetpac for the Spectrum. Lunar etman, as the program is called, has been causing problems for Karl Barratt of Cardiff. He has managed to get to the missile station with the gun fixed on the Moon Rover. When he fired at the missile going to earth, the screen blanked and the computer NEWed itself. He says that this happened four times in a row. If anyone else has had this problem, I'd like to know about it. Meanwhile, Karl, I suggest that you take Ultimate up on their offer to replace any faulty tapes. Going back to the bug in Jetpac, Darren Scott from Corby, Northants thinks that he's found another! If you play a 2-player game and player 2 beats the existing high-score, his score will not become the new high score. Has anyone else had this prob. lem? If you have, then let me know. KILLER BUG I've also heard about a possible bug in Program Power's Killer Gorilla for the BBC. Matthew Fidell writes from Taunton in Somerset that the program has a nasty habit of placing a new screen on top of the old one! You can play on for a moment, before the game crashes completely. Has this happened to you? your name here, perhaps. Decide on your REM line and type it in as line 1. Then enter: POKE (PEEK(23635+256* PEEK(23636)+1,0 and the line will change from 1 to O. Try deleting it! And remember; keep eating the marmalade sandwiches. MOON GUARD UPSIDE DOWN Going back to our 3D issue from October, Peter and Ana Ells sent me this suggestion for Moonguard for the BBC model B. With their monitor, they found that the 3D effect was easier to see if the screen was inverted. To do this, alter the program as follows. Firstly, swap lines 430 and 450. Then, alter 2460 to 2610 to read: 2460 VDU 19,0,5,0,0,0 2470 VDU 19,1,4,0,0,0 2480 VDU 19,2,1,0,0,0 2490 VDU 19,3,0,0,0,0 2500 VDU 19,4,4,0,0,0 2510 VDU 19,5,4,0,0,0 2520 VDU 19,6,0,0,0,0 2530 VDU 19,7,0,0,0,0 2540 VDU 19,8,1,0,0,0 2550 VDU 19,9,0,0,0,0 2560 VDU 19,10,1,0,0,0 2570 VDU 19,11,0,0,0,0 2580 VDU 19,12,0,0,0,0 2590 VDU 19,13,0,0,0,0 2600 VDU 19,14,0,0,0,0 2610 VDU 19,15,0,0,0,0 SPECTRUM MEMORY COUNTER Kai Weber from Reading sent the following hints for Spectrum users. If you're writing a program and want to know how much memory you have left, then you can use the FRE command on most Basic machines. However, the Spectrum lacks such a facility from Basic. But the machine must need such a function in its ROM to see whether or not a program line will fit. The code does exist, and you can find out how much memory is left by typing PRINT 65535-USR 7962. Also, says Mr. Weber, it can be tiresome having to pull out the plug to reset the machine. This normally has to be done if there is graphics or machine code stored above RAMTOP, the parts of memory where CLEAR cannot reach. Typing PRINT USR O will do the same job, clearing the whole of RAM. WHOOPS THE TI JINX STRIKES AGAIN! A couple of lines were left out of the instructions for the 3D maze game for the Texas T199/4a in the yearbook. Firstly, the game needs an Extended Basic cartridge to run. Also, we didn't explain how to get the black graphic character which is used to make the maze. It is created in line 14 to 27, and is a CTRL-COMMA Hunter  quite handy. It will stop anyone from Write to me at Bug Hunter, Computer and Video Games, Durant House, 8 Herbal Hill London, ECIR 5EJ. Or phone me on 01-278.3881. VIC owners should find this routine quite handy. It will stop anyone from breaking into a Basic program once it is ing, When you press RUN/STOP the computer starts a machine code program whose starting address is in locations 770 and 771. If you change the contents of these locations to the machine code which is executed when the machine is first turned on, then when someone presses RUN/STOP the machine will think that it has just been switched on and will clear all its memory. To change the addresses, just type POKE 770,34: POKE 771,253 and now try breaking in to your program. Remember to save anything on tape first, as it will be lost forever once you type RUN. You can return the machine to normal by POKE 770,131:POKE 771,196 Thanks go to Nicholas Cole of Selby for this. screen up by one line, such a routine does exist in the ROM. Simply type LET L=USR(3280) and the contents of the screen will be scrolled upwards by one character. UNBREAKABLE SPECTRUM Robert Burgess writes to me from Rotherham on some wonderful notepaper with that Bear named after a railway station smiling in the corner. (Haven't you heard of Liverpool-Street Bear?) If you want to protect your Spectrum Basic programs from being copied, try this, which will put a REM at line 0 which cannot be erased. You could put DRAGON INTO TANDY WILL GO For everyone who's always asked why we don't publish many TRS 80 listings, here's a way of adapting some Dragon programs from previous issues for the Tandy Colour Computer, BY ROBERT SCHIFREEN COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 39 "

We are pleased to be able to bring you a monthly column by the distinguished professor holder of the Nobel prize for Alien Blasting, Maze Dwellers Award for Fruit Gobbling and author of many books including the best selling, How to Knock the Living Daylights Out of Nasty Little Aliens. In his opening column he turns his attentions to the smash hit game Pac Man. His advice and strategy tips are based on the Atari VCS version -and are not always relevant to the arcades, Atari 400/800, and other home versions of the game. Patterns are the key to consistent high scores in Pac Man. Unfortunately though there is not one super-pattern that will suit everybody, or every screen in the game. The best advice is to practise the pattern that S sous dots, in order to eat them. This is particularly important when reversing or changing direction -as you don't want to look back at a dot, which you think you have eaten, to find it still there. Try to avoid eating the energising pills unless you are really in a tight spot or are sure you can extract maximum points from doing so. When you become really proficient you should aim at leaving the board with all the power pills with one wafer adjacent to each so that you can tempt the ghost into a trap. Make use of the tunnels very often the ghosts will not pursue you through them. Use them to plan your movement around the board don't look upon them as merely emergency exits for when the going gets rough Good Pac play requires precision timing and strategy. It is not sufficient to know the correct patterns, you must also make your turns at just the right second and anticipate the movements of the ghosts caused by your moves. One of the toughest rules of Pac Man that it is important to grasp is to learn to relax. VCS joysticks are not the most responsive sticks ever invented so don't wrench and pull, it only puts you off balance, makes the stick even worse, and upsets your concentration. Professor Video wants your tips. In his search for perfection at all games the prof. is grateful to any readers who can send in tips, or interesting discoveries they have made whilst playing video games.

The Quest of Merravia, VIC 20 (16k) .95 or Commodore 64 .95 At first glance this might SPECTRUM 48k .50 seem to be just another version of a very popular game. How wrong can you be!!! True, the start is simple enough. The Spectrum picks a code of numbers or colours with a selection of levels of difficulty and invites you to do the same. You then take it in turns to guess each others code from the clue supplied after each guess. An extremely well written, fast and very clearly displayed game, with almost inevitable defeat This was exactly as intended but unfortunately something went wrong. During the programming strange uncomplimentary messages began to appear on the screen. At first they were so few they were not taken too seriously. but soon they could no longer be ignored. Somehow the Spectrum had been given a personality a rather devious, supercilious, dislike. Side B contains a version of the game able, hateful, horrible mind compatible with the excellent Currah Speech unit -even worse!! A really challenging and enjoyable adventure, written by a confirmed adventure addict who grew tired of the ease with which he solved other adventures himself. Will accept and act on sentences containing up to nine words. The adventurer becomes Merravid, charged with the task of finding, taking and then returning the magic Firestone of the Dwarves. However, overcoming the many novel and original hazards is no easy matter. Careful and imaginative thought is required if progress is to be made and the Firestone tracked down to the lair of the Dragon of Thargon.

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPEN WELL, JUST WHAT IS IN THAT LETTER.. Well, do you know what was in the mysterious letter that interested Holmes so much? You do! Then why not let us in on the secret. We've got six C&VG The Champ shirts waiting for the best six answers to our Holmes riddle. Answers on a postcard only please to Sherlock Holmes Competition, Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ. Closing date is January 16th and the editor's and Holmes' of course — decision is final. MORE FREE TAPES It was one of those nights that make you want to get as close to the fire as you can and enjoy a nice glass of claret and read a good novel. The mist outside was thick and damp as Sherlock Holmes settled into his favourite chair in the comfortable sitting room of his Baker Street apartments. Dr Watson was out at the opera and Holmes was looking forward to a nice quiet evening alone. But first, thought Holmes, I must just go through that pile of letters on my desk. They might contain some interesting items of news.  Holmes got up and walked over to his elegant antique roll top desk and opened it, withdrawing the pile of letters resting on the top shelf. He placed the pile of letters on the small table by his armchair and poured himself a liberal glass of claret before settling back into the chair. He opened the top letter on the pile another bill! The next one was more interesting. As he read the letter his eyes widened in amazement at the words it contained. \"This is incredible!\" he exclaimed, beginning to re-read the letter. Out in the street the mist began to thicken. The few moving figures in the street, huddled-up against the cold, were reduced to mysterious shadows. Silently one of these shadows moved toward the brightly lit window of 221B Baker Street and peered inside. Holmes was still deeply engrossed in the letter. The mysterious figure reached inside his coat and moved closer to the window... Where were you, Commodore 64 owners in Greater Manchester?

You can jump the gaps and the pies and fireballs by pressing the jump key and a movement key to power you in the right direction. Certain objects are positioned around the building which will earn you bonus points if you managed to pick them up but there are a few that explode on contact, so beware! Extra fireballs and pies appear after each screen is cleared, and you'll get a bonus man after you've completed 10 BORDER 1: PAPER 1: CLS : IN four screens.

"HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN A MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURE RECENTLY? If so, it is quite probable that you are presently suffering from TIS, more commonly known as Total Involvement Syndrome. TIS manifests itself in a number of ways, one of the most dramatic symptoms being a victim's complete inability to fee at ease in the world of reality. Other symptoms include insomnia, a desparate need to play a Mysterious Adventure, ar an overwhelming sense of acute enjoyment. Experts believe that TIS is usually contracted as a result of prolonged exposure to Mysterious Adventures, this is commonly caused by owning any of the following Home Computers:48K SPECTRUM, BBC MODEL A OR B, TRS80, COLOUR GENIE, ATARI 400/800, COMMODORE 64, DRAGON 32, 16K ZX81, LYNX etc. When questioned about this epidemic, a representative of DIGITAL FANTASIA, a company who are actively involved in research and development work on Mysterious Adventures said, \"There is probably no cure for TIS other than mains failure, faulty RAM chips etc. which can be at best only a Temporary solution\". \"In the absence of a more permanent cure. I would advise TIS sufferers to submit to the Syndrome and obtain Mysterious Adventures from any sources available to them\". \"TIS is highly contagious and in view of the current Worldwide Epidemic, I would say enjoy it while you can, resistance is futile\". If you have a BBC Computer or a 48K SPECTRUM, you can obtain Mysterious Adventures direct from DIGITAL FANTASIA in any of the following dosages. (1) THE GOLDEN BATON 2) THE TIME MACHINE 5) ESCAPE FROM PULSAR 7 3) ARROW OF DEATH (PART 1 8) THE WIZARD AKYRZ 16 CIRCUS 9) PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA 4 ARROWIAP DE 7) FEASIBILITY EXPERIMENT 10) TEN LITTLE INDIANS Each Dose costs .95 including V.A.T. and Postage.

In \"Road Racer\" (on 16k) you'll find out if you're skilful enough to drive round a terrifying track GOLD RUSH at death defying speeds, and reach the black and white flag in one piece. \"Gold Rush\" (on 16k) is no walk-over either. Under neath the eerie planet of Oron is a vast cavern full of gold and demons. You have to get the gold and the deadly demons have to get you. In \"Blockade Runner\" (on 16k) the earth is under siege and you must get lifeBLOCKADE saving Supplies through. RUNNER When you've avoided the dense meteor shower, the moving laser barriers, the space mines, the tractor beam units and the alien warships, you'll be good enough to try the other 5 skill levels. \"River Rescue\" (on 48k) RIVER is a runaway success on other RESCUE formats. It's now available on Spectrum. You'll have to navigate the wildest and most dangerous river on earth in a powerful patrol-boat. But keep a sharp look-out for the killer crocodiles.

Oh, hello there! I'm Cyril the gourmet caterpillar and I just love the odd bit of fruit and veg to round off a good mealof more fruit and veg! I'm on the look out for a tasty garden to raid. Fancy coming along for a quick bite? You guide Cyril the caterpillar around the vegetable patch-eating the fruit and avoiding the vegetables which appear randomly on the screen. If Cyril mistakenly eats a vegetable some of his tail falls off! Two segments for a carrot and five for a turnip. If Cyril shrinks to less than a head and one segment the game ends. Cyril can grow again by snapping up fruit he grows by one segment each time he eats two bananas or five cherries. When Cyril has eaten 20 fruits the screen changes colour and the player gets 30 seconds at a bonus level. Cyril must now eat vegetables and avoid the fruit! Talk about a confused caterpillar! When 30 seconds are up the game returns to normal and the game continues. At random intervals during play the caterpillar's tail will start to burn like a fuse. The only way Cyril can save himself is to reach the medicine bottle as fast as possible and eat it to gain a 500 point bonus and put out the flame. Each segment consumed by the flame is left behind as a spark showing the player just how much Cyril has shrunk. Fortunately Cyril can eat anything while his tail is on fire so he can gobble his way through the garden without À being affected by the vegetables. Oh yes, one final hazard. If Cyril touches the sides of the screen he will die instantly. 960 DATAO, 10224, 126,165, 165,231. 126.160.112.240, 120,60, 12.6.1 990 DATF60 24 50 66 129 255, 126,68,126, 129, 188,164,188,160, 129, 126.999 READY 1 REM TURNIP TURMOIL CLIFF ASHFORD PROGRAMS 5/3/83 10 POKE36869.255 DIMCX(9) CY(9) DX=DY=1.

The equipment was quickly set up and the various experiments began. Suddenly the peaceful scene was shattered by a warning alarm from the spacecraft. Meteors! A huge shower heading directly for the exploration team. Will the explorers manage to fight off the rock shower and survive until the mother-ship comes to their aid? Play on! The meteors come in waves 10 meteors to each wave. If you survive six waves, the mother-ship appears and collects the exploration team departing impressively! You can only have one rocket on screen at a time. The \"V\" key fires a rocket angled toward the left, the \"N\" key fires rockets to the right, the \"B\" key fires one rocket vertically. You are also armed with three PANIC destructors which destroy rocks anywhere on the screen. These are activated by pressing the Space key. You may abort your mission by pressing \"A\" but use this only as a last resort when destruction is inevitable. Scoring: You get 100 x the wave number for shooting a meteor, a bonus at the end of each wave, a 5000 bonus for not being blown up, a 5000 bonus for being picked up by the mother-ship and an accuracy bonus depending on the number of rocks destroyed.

"Write to Program Extra at Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ. Please mark youx letters \"Program Extra\". Remember we'll pay  for any tips or short programs we print. omputer and Video Games is starting the New Year in real style with a Spectrum listing that will have professional software houses quaking in their shoes. Talking of professional software we've got a great shoot-'em-up game by Jeff Minter of Llamasoft fame for the Commodore 64 in this month's issue. of everything. What could be easier? 10 INPUT \"Number of programs to be stored\";W 20 DIMA(W) 30 FORS=1 to W 40 LOAD\" 50 A(S)=TOP 60 PAGE=A(S) 70 NEXT S 80 PRINT \"HERE IS THE LIST OF NUMBERS\" 90 FORS= 1 TO W: 100 PRINT A(S): NEXT S When the program's finished you'll have up to 10 games in your micro to switch between. This feature isn't just useful for playing but writing them too. Two versions of a game can be kept in memory at the same time and new techniques and ideas can be compared against tried and tested methods. PROGRAM EXTRA bark White's Demolition has caused quite a stir since it first bounced onto our reviewer's lap and into his tape recorder. I'm sure you'll be just as impressed with the game as we at C&VG were. Program Extra talked to Mark recently about Demoltion and his plans for future games. Demolition, it's hard to believe, was Mark's first attempt at writing a games program for the Spectrum. He spent a whole week of his school holidays working into the small hours to perfect Demolition Mark spent a lot of time on the program making sure it was efficient as possible because you know what they say about the Spectrum you don't run a program, you \"stroll it\". Mark gave me some tips on structured programming like sticking Data statements and game instructions at the bottom of the listing and For Next loops near the beginning. Even Mark's programming talents have a limit and he's now abandoned Sinclair Basic in favour of 280 machine code. Golf is his first mc game and is a great improvement even on Demolition. Future issues of C&VG will no doubt feature some of Mr White's other achievements Smurf Attack and Cricket to mention two. he C&VG office is inundated every month with phone calls from new readers asking for advice, pleading and begging us to help them with their new micros. Even die-hard C&VG addicts have been heard to say they wished they knew more about Basic or had a better understanding of their machines. With this in mind Program Extra have decided to launch Down to Basics, a regular new spot aimed at giving you some \"Basic\" training and all the information you'll need to enter our games listings with the least possible fuss. Let's start by having a look at the origins of Basic. Basic, the language, had its beginning in the early '60s at a British University where it was developed for computing students as a \"stepping stone\" language before moving onto a more conventional programming language like Fortran or Cobol. Today Basic is the world's most widely understood computer language. 2 million people use Sinclair Basic alone. Basic is different from most other computer languages in that it's interpreted instead of compiled. Interpreted languages are decoded by the computer line-by-line while the program is running. Whereas compiled dialects are changed into what is known as source code, a type of machine code that can then be executed as normal. This difference also accounts for Basic's relative slowness compared with Fortran or Pascal for instance. Next month we will be taking a closer look at Basic and discovering why it's so successful and finding a new pretender to Basic's throne. how many programs do you think can fit in a BBC micro? Alvin Rich from Newcastle has written to me with a tip which allows you to store up to 10 programs in the BBC simultaneously! I'll let Alvin explain. \"You first of all load a program into the computer in the normal way. Once it's been loaded type into the BBC as a command PRINT TOP. If everything has gone according to plan the Beeb should print up a number larger than 3000, let's use 5000 as an example. Now just type PAGE=5000 and press return. The second game can now be loaded using the normal methods. If at any time you want to return to the program enter the command PAGE=&E00. If all that seems too much like hard work then just stick the listing below into your computer and it will take care hat's it for this month except to remind you that February's issue is a C&VG special with a full 48 extra pages crammed with great games listings.

"Number charts BY TREVOR TRURAN 329 2469 noon 19753 164609 As our super de-luxe chart shows, 9876543210 is very nearly a remarkable number. It fails to qualify, as do so many mathematical marvels, when it reaches the seventh stage. The property it nearly possesses, expressed somewhat formally, is that, for N=1 to 10, the number formed by the first N digits can be divided exactly by N. In words we can understand, if accompanied by a flashing of the eyes from words to chart which will make them appear to be a couple of small comments in solar orbit, it will be clearer if we say that the number formed by the first 2 digits (98) can be divided without remainder by 2. Ditto the number formed by the first 3 digits (987) 3 will go into it exactly. And so on... until we come to the seventh digit number which is not divisible by 7. The strange thing is that there exists just one ten-digit number which uses the digits 0 to 9 once each which has the required property all the way through to 10. Why not put your brain and your micro to work and cobble together a short program to search for that num6 1410934714285 9 12345679 10973936 987654321 ber. If the programming is not to your taste then you can find the answer by simple deduction and a spot of trial and error. After all, it does not require the services of Bertrand Russell to realise that the tenth figure must be zero, the fifth is 5 and that odd and even digits must alternate. When you have found the number, print it neatly on a card, add your name and address and hastily post to Puzzling Contest, Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ. Blooming petal problem It may strike the more discerning among those present here at the perennial meeting of the East Chidgely Flower, Produce and Surf Riding Society, that it is not the ideal time of year to launch our latest botanical specimen, Arboreas Literatus. As you can see, despite every precaution, the blossoms have already fallen and lie scattered on the floor. If we are to preserve this species for posterity, it will be necessary to replace each bloom in its correct position with spirit gum and take a quicker-than-instant picture. There is one clue to where each word fell from the leaves between adjacent blossoms bear a number which gives the number of letters which are the same in both the neighbouring flowers. Thus if BOWLER were next to BESTIR, the leaf between them would have the number 2 since the letters B and R are the same in both. Note that, although both words contain the letter E, it is not counted as matching since the E's occupy different positions in the two words. Can you save the photographer a long wait by working out the only possible position on the plant for each word? 114 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES DOCTOR BESTIR LESSON  BETTER POTION DEBTOR BOWLER LOTION POSTER "

Ask it a simple question, like, to take a random example, which of five people at a recent computer fair bought what computer with how many functions made in which country and you get the following stream of clever stuff: DATA ... The Putcom is English. It was not purchased by Mrs Bitt or Mr Putter. DATA ... The Cherry has more functions than the German computer. DATA ... Miss Watt bought the Supremo. DATA ... The French machine has 28 functions. This is more than Mr Jones' purchase and less than the Supremo. DATA Mrs Bitt's computer has less functions than the Cherry, but 14 more than the machine from Luxembourg, which is not the Supremo. DATA ... The SRG has twice as many functions as Mr Cross's computer. Task you! And you know what's coming, don't you?

"www can busu LOST Y IN THE JUNGLE Welcome to the jungle! This issue we bring you the first part of an Adventure written by our Sharp expert Frank R. Rooney. You'll not want to miss what follows in future issues otherwise you'll be lost forever at the mercy of all those nasty wild animals! And there are more mysterious things in this jungle too! Like hidden cities and lost tribes of particularly nasty natives. Frank has written this Adventure with our younger readers in mind — but don't think it's going to be an easy one to solve just because of that. One problem about keying in Adventure listings is that you often know all the key words and locations when you've finished. So why not get a friend to help you key in the listing then you won't HONE know too much about the game before you begin to play. Now turn the page and soon you'll be lost in the jungle.. BY FRANK R. ROONEY RUNS ON A SHARP MZ8OK TR. COLLINS "


"These words come from the pages of a diary found by the banks of a jungle pool... It was the roar of some distant jungle beast that brought me back to my senses. Only then did I realise the danger I was in alone, with miles of unexplored jungle between me and the nearest civilisation. Miles of jungle full of wild animals, deadly insects and reptiles and rife with legends of lost tribes of fierce cannibals. Only a few short hours ago I had boarded the small light aircraft which was to fly me to exploration headquarters deep in the heart of this, the last uncharted jungle region. But soon after we crossed the river frontier of the jungle area the aircraft developed engine trouble. Suddenly smoke began to fill the cramped cockpit and we went into a steep uncontrollable dive. The aircraft smashed into the jungle canopy and I must have been thrown clear, because I awoke some yards away from the wreckage. There was no sign of the pilot just the sounds of some wild beast dragging something through the undergrowth... Now the light is failing and the weird sounds of the jungle night are beginning to fill the air and I'm beginning to realise that I am well and truly lost in the jungle! Enough of all this scene setting what you need is some hard facts! You are lost in a jungle with only a gun with six shots a knife, a slingshot and two bottles of medicine. Your aim is to find your way back to civilisation without getting killed that's all! You must try to keep up your energy by eating and drinking whenever possible — or you will quite simply die of exhaustion. The jungle is 50 miles square and each move is the equivalent of one mile. Skilful judgement is required, but there are also random events that will make things even more interesting! Will I ever be able to find my way back to civilisation? Luckily I have a small supply of emergency rations which I discovered among the wreckage of the aircraft and water seems plentiful in this area of the jungle. But what of the fierce natives and even fiercer jungle animals that I'll encounter on my trek through the unexplored undergrowth! Will I be able to survive all the many dangers and hazards? Who knows! I have no choice but to attempt to find my way out of this vast jungle... otherwise I might just as well give myself up to the wild beasts now! Don't miss next month's issue when we'll continue our exploration of Frank Rooney's weird and wonderful jungle. Don't get lost anywhere in the meantime will you!

"TODAY, LEARNING IS A NEW GAME NEW WAYS TO LEARN WITH THE ZX SPECTRUM Programs from Blackboard Software The new range of educational programs from Blackboard Software makes learning an enjoyable process by involving the child in a game which teaches as it entertains. Each program has a step-by-step example section and gives correct answers after a number of attempts. Vocabulary changes can be made, allowing each program to keep pace with the child's development. This flexibility can also be used in the classroom to cater for children of differing ability. The instructive and colourful games which follow the successful completion of each group of sentences provide useful practice in letter recognition and increase familiarity with the Spectrum keyboard. All programs are written for the 48K RAM Spectrum. Alphabet Games Three games of letter recognition (using either upper or lower case) to help children learn the alphabet and find their way round the computer keyboard. Alphagaps The full alphabet is displayed, along with a second, incomplete version. The child must fill in the missing letters. Random Rats-Press the letter key that is displayed on the gun to destroy the rats which have invaded the cellar! Invaders Stop little green men from landing on Earth by pressing the appropriate letter. Subsidised microcomputers are now commonplace as teaching aids for the very youngest children and the ZX Spectrum is prominent amongst those micros at use in schools. In the relatively short time that the Spectrum has been at work in the classroom, two questions have been answered. Yes: with the right software, the micro can and does teach effectively and thoroughly (and gives teachers more time to devote to individual pupils). Yes: young children think little of working rapidly and successfully, with a screen and keyboard, on even quite complex subjects. In this Sinclair Special we reveal a range of educational software specifically designed to make full use of these advantages. The programs produced by Sinclair in collaboration with Macmillan Education are fascinating. They deal imaginatively and most effectively with early reading skills and take a truly refreshing approach to basic science. In the Blackboard range we've programs which bring a light-hearted clarity to the tricky matters of spelling and punctuation. These programs are designed for use both at home and in the classroom. Each program is accompanied by full documentation which gives parents helpful advice and guidance on the educational objectives. The programs covered on these pages represent only a fraction of the full and fastgrowing list of Spectrum software. Be assured we'll keep you in touch with new developments as they happen. Early Punctuation While an animated matchstick man marches above displayed sentences the child must decide which punctuation mark is missing and where to insert it. At the touch of a key the matchstick man drops the mark into place. After successful completion of every sentence in the exercise, light relief comes in the form of a bottle-shooting game! The Apostrophe As each sentence is displayed, a bird appears with a worm in its beak. The keyboard is used to move the bird and drop the worm into the correct place for the apostrophe. When ten sentences have been corrected, the Grub Game is displayed. Press the correct character to change the grub into a butterfly...before it munches through a flower! Capital Letters A program to teach the use of capital letters. Sentences incorporating proper nouns and sentences without opening capitals are displayed. The child inserts the correction by guiding an animated figure to the appropriate letter. For each correct answer an apple grows on a tree. After ten correct answers the child's skills in recognising letters and using the Spectrum keyboard are needed to save the apples as they fall to the ground. Speech Marks A comprehensive program including sentences with one or two sets of speech marks (\"inverted commas\") and exercises in both direct and reported speech. Using the Spectrum keyboard, a cursor is used to guide speech marks to the correct position. The program offers three levels of difficulty, with full examples for each section. Guide Max the mouse through a maze, after the correct completion of five sentences from each section, but beware of Persian cats! David Park Education Marketing Manager Castle Spellerous A spelling game with ten levels of vocabulary, including words with silent first letters, double letters and other difficult words. The Princess has been captured and carried off to Castle Spellerous. Helped by ten soldiers, the child can attempt a rescue by giving the right answers. Part of a siege tower is built for each correctly spelt word. Mistakes are costly the wicked wizard appears as a vampire bat, turning the men into frogs, butterflies and bats! When ten words are spelt correctly the rescue begins and the wizard takes flight. "


"SINCLAIR + MACMILLAN: A NEW DIMENSION IN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS Sinclair have joined forces with Macmillan Education to produce a completely new and different range of educational software. The results so far can be seen in these exceptional programs. The Learn to Read series is derived from Macmillan Education's best-selling primary school reading scheme, Gay Way. It offers a unique opportunity for parents and teachers to participate in the child's first experience in reading. Macmillan Education's Science Horizons is one of Britain's most successful school science schemes. Each program concentrates on key scientific ideas and through simulation of real life, makes the learning process entertaining and enjoyable. VU IV a un Awamu wa Learn to Read 1 Learn to Read 1 is designed for children who are just beginning to read. It is in four parts, each of which develops skills central to the reading process-letter recognition, sight vocabulary, early spelling and memory. The program is full of colour and fun and children will enjoy learning to read as they meet the animal characters Ben the dog, Jip the cat and their friends. Learn to Read 2 Learn to Read 2 extends the fundamental reading skills practised in the first program, as well as encouraging logical thinking. The child's vocabulary is gradually built up as new words such as \"red\" \"green\" \"car \"ship\" and \"bus\" are introduced. In addition, Learn to Read 2 features an attractive 'reward' system enabling children to see their achievements grow. Learn to Read 3 Learn to Read 3 builds on the child's progress so far, so that he or she can gain the confidence to move on through the complex reading process. Learn to Read 3 features four different activities, all of which are colourful and lively. Further vocabulary is introduced until the child is reading more than 30 words. M UTATTA MAMMUT Learn to Read 4 Learn to Read 4 is the alphabet program in the Learn to Read series. Using various stimulating activities the program gives the child plenty of practice in working with the alphabet matching initial letters to words and pictures and spotting missing letters. These exercises build familiarity with simple sequences within the alphabet. Learn to Read 5 Learn to Read 5 teaches positional language often difficult to understand and remember-by using words and phrases such as \"behind\" and \"in front of \"inside\" and \"outside.\" The program first demonstrates the meanings of the words using clear pictures. It then tests the child's understanding of the words in two lively games. Cargo Set sail around the world. Choose your ports of call New York, Tokyo, Belem, Helsinki then the real challenge begins! You must reach your destinations safely, weathering storms on the way. But first, load your cargo using all your knowledge and skill. Poor loading can mean capsizing and sinking. Your rank, if not your life, is always at stake! Glider Be a glider pilot! The glider models real-life gliding conditions so that you can learn through experience. As the pilot you must consider the time of day, the amount of cloud cover and the kind of terrain below you in order to find the up-currents of air that will keep you airborne. Try to fly as far as possible and, when you are high enough, navigate your way back to your home airfield and land safely if you can. Survival Discover what it is like to be an animal in the wild! Be a lion stalking your prey, escaping human hunters. Or be a hawk, mouse or even a butterfly, searching for food and avoiding predators. Survival models the natural world and brings to life hazards that different creatures must face in their struggle to stay alive. Magnets With an army of small magnets you set out to conquer the powerful supermagnets of your opponent. You have one weapon your forces of magnetic attraction and repulsion The strategy is simple: attract smaller magnets to build strength to repel the supermagnet. When cornered, just turn your poles on your enemy and see what happens! Learn to Read and Science Horizons programs are written for a 48K RAM Spectrum, and are supplied complete with comprehensive supporting documentation for parents and teachers. "

"COBALANCE By Garry Marshall FANCY MAKING A DOUGHNUT? spective view. The direction of view ing is fixed by the two angles Al and A2 as shown in the illustration. and A2 as shown in the illustration. The same names are used for the corresponding variables in the program. In fact these two angles are exactly those used in a coordinate system that is an invaluable aid in solid geometry and they are also used in astronomy, one of the angles is the azimuth. In the program, Rl is the radius of the circle that sweeps out the Torus and R2 is its distance from the line about which it revolves. The The arrays X and Y hold the xand y-coordinates of points on each cross-section of the Torus that is plotted. All the other variables hold intermediate results. The illustrations were plotted using the following values. For the first, Rl and R2 were 50 and 250 respectively, and Al and A2 were both 45 degrees. For the second, R1 and R2 were 25 and 250, and Al and A2 were both 60 degrees. This issue we present a short graphics program that shows how easily a complex shape can be plotted in a realistic way. The object that is displayed has the shape of a ring doughnut, and its proper name is a Torus. By starting with a circle and a line that does not cut the circle anywhere, the shape of a Torus can be swept out by revolving the circle around the line. The accompanying illustrations, which were generated by our program, show cross-sections through the doughnut, all of which take the form of rings. The program is written for the BBC Model B microcomputer and uses its highest resolution graphics mode. Since the only graphics commands in the program are the ones to set the graphics mode, and MOVE and DRAW, it is a simple matter to convert the program to run on any other micro having high-resolution graphics facilities. The views of the Torus are drawn as they would be seen from a considerable distance. This simplifies the problem of constructing a perThe program that produced the first Torus was the listing shown at the bottom lefthand side of this page. These two illustration show the Torus plotted using the information in my article.

In order to get from one chamber to another you must fight off the indigenous aliens to collect an energised crystal which will neutralize the 'force field guarding the two exits, The Pyramid is inhabited by a total of 60 wierd and exotic alien types, all of which are beautifully animated. You will meet a whole variety of demons, droids, insects and monsters, with a sprinkling of the more unusual, the extra-terrestrial tweezers, galactic strawberry, cosmic claw, mutant eye, plus a whole host of entities that defy rational description. You will no doubt invent your own nicknames. You proceed to explore the Pyramid from top to bottom with the difficulty generally increasing with the depth of level. Depending on the choice of exit from each chamber you are likely to have a different game every time you play. Apart from the challenge of trying to achieve the highest score possible the pyramid contains a number puzzle to solve.
