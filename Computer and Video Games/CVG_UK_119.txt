"TURTLEY DEVIOUS! NEWS M irrorsoft are really starting the Christmas release ball rollIVling with a mass of products in the pipeline, two of which promise to be something extra special. Their biggest release promises to be the conversion of Konami's hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coin-op. Featuring all the levels from the original arcade machine, Mirrorsoft are hoping that their latest Turtles project will be every bit as popular as the original. Probe are handling the programming for Amiga, ST, PC, C64. Spectrum and Amstrad versions. Keep your eyes right here for more news as and when it happens. MONES SEMINEE GUERRILLAS IN THE MIDST Dolivian freedom fighters aren't usually the sort of people to Dsign licensing deals with software houses, so how come CCS are producing a strategy game based upon the exploits of Che Guevara, conductor of the 1966/67 civil war in that country? Well, he's dead, so he didn't have much of a prescence in the talks. The game, Guerilla In Bolvia, takes place across the whole of the country, with the player leading a guerrila unit to the goal of conquering La Paz. Beginning with a measly fifteen soldiers, you will have to deal with ambushes, militia attacks, food collection and other such revolutionary things. Sound fun to you? Don that beret and camouflage jacket and toddle off down to the local software vendor, who should be stocking the Amiga game soon at a reactionary price of .99. Ever busy, Mirrorsoft are also beavering away on Devious Designs. Described as \"an unusual fast-action arcade game\". the player takes on the role of JJ Maverick, square-jawed hero and all-round good guy, who must stop the evil Doctor Devious from turning the world's must famous buildings into cubes. This strange-sounding game will appear on Amiga, ST and C64 at prices of .99 for 16 bit and .99 for the 64 version ARABIAN KNIGHT ATA PRICE THAT'S RIGHT M irrorsoft, having purIVI chased top US gamemakers Cinemaware, are rereleasing one of their early interactive movies at a cheapy price. Sinbad and the Throne Of The Falcon sees the swashbuckling Saudi battling through the Middle East against a host of mythical meanies including skeletons, wizards and monsters. 010 Sinbad must also brave the watery terrors of the Black Sea, ensuring he doesn't smash into any rocks as his ship is buffeted about on the waves. It's quite a jolly jape, although looking a tad dated nowadays but as they're putting the game out on their Mirror Image label at a price of only .99 on Amiga, you can hardly argue, can you. "

"EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP 1992 NEWS AN ELITE TRIO lite have been extra-quiet for a good while, but now it seems they've woken up, dusted themselves down and decided to do something with the licenses which they've been holding onto for aaaaages Last Battle is a conversion of the rather unspectacular Sega coin-op and tells the tale of Azarak, whose homeland has been taken by enemies and who, together with his friends Alyssa and Max, sets out to reclaim it. Graphically Last Battle is looking not bad, but whether the game is going to be up to much we'll just have to wait and see. Also from Elite is European Championship 1992, due for release in Autumn 1991 and based on the coin-op World Cup '90. Confused? Us too! Anyway, the game will include the teams who qualify for next year's European Championship in Sweden and will apparently use the graphic data and source code from the original arcade machine. But the biggest game from Elite is probably Dragon's Lair on the Nintendo. Starring Dirk the Daring. Dragon's Lair will not feature the cartoon-quality graphics featured in the coin-op and 16 bit versions, but at the same time Elite have dispensed with the limited gameplay and have opted instead for an arcade adventure-type affair based around the exploits of Dirk. Prices for all these games are to be announced except for Last Battle. which will set you back .53 on Amiga and PC, with the ST version coming in at .42. DRAGONS SPORTS GALORE! LIVES DRAGONS LAIR SOLD OPS P2OC Two fab new games are on their way from Mirrorsoft on their new Cinemaware label. The first, TV Sports Baseball, is the latest in the sport series, and includes all the features which made the previous titles so sought-after. Graphics, sound and gameplay are all given the Cinema ware touch, but one of the most important features has to be the strong statistical slant of TV Sports Baseball. With a 162 game season, 25-man rosters with 5-man reserve lists to replace injured players and 26 baseball teams, TV Sports Baseball promises to be the most involved of the series. The other release, Rollerbabes, sounds as if it could be something really special. A future sim incorporating a variety a sports styles like hockey, wrestling, boxing and skateboarding. Rollerbabes stars teams of hunky guys and gorgeous girlies, all out to kick the living daylights out of their opponents. Teams include the Eraser Heads (schoolteachers), Buzzcuts (hairdressers) Reddiwreckers (a demolition crew) and the cream of the crop, the Rollerbabes.

"Gameboy games are all about skill, you can keep getting better on them, but once you've finished a Lynx game, that's it. it's not a lot for 30, is it?\" Have they been to the arcades recently? Yup, according to Mark: \"We've been going to the arcades a lot when we're at home, but you always go back to the classics, don't you? mean, I'm still putting a lot of money into Defender and Pacland I'm also getting back into Super Hang-On. \"This could be because I'm in the middle of taking my bike test at the moment and I need all the practice I can get!\" Jimmy adds to this nostalgic burst with, \"I'm getting back into the classics too. I've spent a lot of time playing World Cup 90 and I really love the original Double Dragon.

They play computer games! Take the Little Angels for example, Britain's newest and greatest rock exports. When the urge to party takes hold, they take a deep breath and play a spot of Tetris. Yup. metal gurus and heartthrobs to squillions of screaming girls. Little Angels are games nuts. As is the norm at C&VG. we invited Mark Plunkett and Jimmy Dickinson from Little Angels to come and tell us about their fave games. They got into games a very long while back, playing Defender in a Scarborough (their homeland) arcade. Eventually losing interest in vid games, they decided that a life of rock n' roll would be far more fun. How wrong they were and they soon found themselves hooked on Tetris, playing the arcade as well as the Gameboy version. Obviously the lads enjoy the game. Mark says \"I always score better when I'm on the lav\", but their other favourites include Super Mario Land, Sonic the Hedgehog and anything to do with the Super Famicom, Jimmy. Angel's keyboard wizard, got so involved with the Gameboy that he upgraded to an Atari Lynx Disappointment was the order of the day though, when Jimmy said \"It's not as good as the Gameboy though, it eats the batteries and there's a different type of game on it.\" He went on to explain. \"I mean, So there you have it, the CVG potted guide to why Pac Man is better than a dressing room full of screaming girls.

"REVIEW FAMICOM .95 BY KONAMI All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\". So the saying goes, so to combat boredom they created Geoman Land a sprawling. 19-area pleasure island where visitors can do whatever they desire. Bet, enter quizzes, play video games: if the thrillsters want it, they can have it. Unfortunately for our two heroes who have travelled to Geoman Land for the time of their lives, nothing in life is free. All the attractions cost money, which the two lads simply don't possess. No matter, for as well as being a couple of lively fellas these guys have no little morale fibre, allowing them to openly and shamelessly mug the indigenous population of their hard-earned in order to pay for their laughs. They do have one thing going for them though: the fun-loving pair are devout animal lovers and, when they here that cats are being kidnapped in each of the areas, they decide not to travel to the next zone until they've freed a moggy. Ahh! WART 1 RZ Everyone in the CVG/Mean Machines office thinks this game is the best thing since buttered baps and who am I to rock the boat? Not 1 1 have to agree with the general consensus that Geoman Land is a fantastic arcade adventure, incorporating so many extras it makes a dodgy, 100-game Nintendo cart look barren in comparison. There are just so many things to do, places to go, games to play in this masterpiece of Famicom programming that you'll possibly never unearth all of its secrets; in fact, it's probable that at times you'll not want to, going back to one or two of the brilliant arcade games instead. Humour and presentation is the name of the game, with laughs a million (there's a couple of statues with holes where the heads should be, so that your characters can stick their faces through for no reason other than for a giggle!) and events such as the Farting Play unbelievably weird, but blummin' good fun! Sound is ace, with bars and bars of tinkly tunes and effects and probably the only downpoint of the whole cart is that the the Fammy slows down pretty badly when there's a lot on screen. Thankfully, that isn't too often and it doesn't really intrude on the great time you'll have exploring Geoman Land. PAUL RAND rotestoj Q 016 016"

You'll get the chance to play at least two arcade games, play that weird game where you hit moles over the head with a hammer, watch strip shows and all sorts of other so-called attractions. Gameplay is excellent throughout and Geoman Land hangs together brilliantly you never know what's just around the corner. If I do have a criticism it's that the main game running around and beating up bad guys for cash can quickly become a bit dull, but this is more than made up by the sheer variety of sub-games. Totally original, utterly vast and darned funny to boot, Geoman Land is a bit of a must buy for your Famicomeven if you do have to endure the incredible farting man! Highly recommended. TIM BOONE Shoot the invisible girlie with your loose change GASEOUS GEOMANS! Not only are there quiz shows to enter, dice games to bet on and coin-ops such as Nemesis and Breakout to fill with coinage, there are also concerts showing where guests to Geoman Land can go and pass the time of day. One such play sees one man turning slowly into four, before doing a little dance and ending the performance with a mega-fart so cataclysmic it'll have your characters sprawled across the floor!

"REVIEW from the Arcade NINTENDO ETBA BY MB GAMES ARI There was a time when being a marble was A-OK. Living with your chums in a nice, warm bag, only having to do any work when some little kid was bored and would drag yourself and your mates out for a bit of a bash. Even then it wasn't too bad. Ok, those humans would smash you against one another, but it was all taken very well and a couple of Asprin later you'd be as right as rain. But things started to get tough when you got lost down a drain. Finding yourself lost in a world where only the most athletic marble can hope to escape, things were not looking pleasant. For this is the secret world of the Marathon Marble a sort of Running Man for spherical, glass playthings. Consisting of six increasingly difficult levels, any marble venturing into this nightmarish world would have to complete each stage within the allotted time limit or else. karena Springies Black Marbles Some games you either love or loathe. With Marble Madness, you'll love it AND loathe it at exactly the same time! This excellent conversion of the classic coin-op is so addictive, yet so maddeningly frustrating that playing for long periods of time will have the player climbing up the walls and begging their parents to phone the local men-in-white-coats! The gameplay eases you into the proceedings, making you feel confident enough to attempt a few tricky moves, at which time you'll fall off the ledge about one zillion times, waste a load of time and find that, later on in the level, you don't have enough time to complete that stage. And even when you do survive to the end with a fair number of seconds, you'll doubtless take the wrong route, make a complete balls-up of getting back to where you should be and fail to reach your goal by about half a second! Graphically, NES Marble Madness is very faithful to the original, which isn't surprising as the original is ages old. Sound is pretty weak and you'll probably be reaching for the volume button fairly swiftly, but it's that gameplay that does it for Marble Madness. A great game, but don't attempt to play if you suffer from high blood pressure... PAUL RAND 020 "


"de Classic BLE I REVIEW ADNESS , Malletts IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TIME Each of the stages in Marble Madness must be completed within a set time limit if the player wants to move on to the next, more challenging level. Along the way, your glass ball must ensure that he doesn't fall off the sides of the track, thereby shattering into tiny shards and losing valuable time. Not only that, there's a vast array of nasties out there all doing their best to stop you whilst you're on a roll, so to speak. On completion of a stage. your remaining seconds are added to the next level's total, giving you enough time to complete that track or so you hope! You just can't keep a great game down, and Marble Madness is back for a bit of rock 'n' roll on Nintendo! This is one of the all-time coin-op classics faithfully converted to the NES, retaining all the qualities of its arcade grandaddy. Graphically it's nothing to write home about just like the original. Sonically it's fairly mediocre too just like original. But in terms of gameplay it's streets ahead, with just the right balance between maddening difficulty and one-more-go playability. Constantly forcing you ahead is the desire to see the next mad marble world and beat all the tricks and traps contained therein and this can become furiously obsessive after a while. More than just a trip down memory lane, Marble Madness is as fresh today as it's always been just like those Hovis ads. Buy Marble Madness and enjoy some fine gameplay and a fair few nights burning the midnight oil in a wonderful, wacky world full of things which might just drive you round the twist...

"ZREVIEW .99 AMIGA BY RENEGADE W e all have pockets, but not the sort of pockets that you'll find V in Pocketland. And certainly not the ones stitched into the Bitmap Kid's togs. He's got magic pockets, in which he keeps all his toys. Not little toys like Matchbox cars and toy soldiers, but big ones like bikes and boxing gloves! The Bitmap kid cannot live with out his toys, so imagine his disappointment when a gang of monsters appear from the Underworld and derobe him of his playthings before warping back to their domain to store them throughout the kingdom Off goes the Kid to the Old Man who, sympathetic to the young ster's plight, kits him out with a black hole to transport him to the Underworld and a magic whirlwind to use against the nasties en sconced there. Shoving the whirlwind into his pocket, Bitmap Kid throws down the black hole, jumps inside and, within an instant, finds himself standing in the kingdom of his enemies. Here, across the four lands which make up the Underworld, are hidden his toys. Being the coolest dude in Pocketland, Bitmap Kid must find them or be laughed at eternally upon his return. And he can't be having that now, can he? claustrophobic cavern capers on level 1 UBY OO pepp 30 016600 They've neke They've whipe This time they'vego NO ONE MESSES WIT GAME FOR A LAUGH Considering the time it's taken, Magic Pockets had to be something a bit good. And as usual, the Bitmap Bros have delivered the goods spectacularly. Here is a product which looks good, plays great and sounds unbelievable! Having been greeted with a spoof Operation Wolf intro showing the Bitmap Kid tying his shoelaces, straightening his cap and such, the player is then mindblown by the fantastic sampled Betty Boo track on the front-end. After coming back to some semblance of normality, you'll then press fire once more and be amazed once more by the top-notch graphics and stylish gameplay which the Bros have created. This is not your average platform shoot 'em up the baddies have intelligence and the bonus items aren't random. There are secret rooms all over the shop, inside which can be found some great gear, including weapon helmets taken from previous Bitmap games in particular the Xenon II helmet which fires a giant laser bolt from the eyeslit! Massive maps allow the player to explore and experiment with objects for ages without having to immediately go for the exits. In my mind, Magic Pockets is the best thing from the Bitmaps yet. Buy it and agree. PAUL RAND The Bitmaps have done away with the conventional idea of end-level guardians and instead have opted for bonus games at the end of each level. To move to the next land, the Bitmap Kid must either race his bike against monster cyclists and have a boxing match with a gorilla, amongst other things, each event involving the use of the latest toy retrieved. Groovy, huh? 2025000 24 "

ES WITH THE BITMAP KID BETTY BOO AND THE BITMAPS Renegade, being a part of music company Rythm King, don't have to look far when they're searching for a snappy ditty to include in their games Magic Pockets is no exception! For their latest product, the Bitmap Bros have enlisted the talents of dusky songstress Betty Boo, whose Doin The Doo appears in all its remixed, sampled glory on the front end of Magic Pockets. The lads went into a recording studio, sampled various instruments from each track making up the single, then lumped 'em all together using a Soundtracker clone. The end result is a near perfect interpretation of the original tune. And so it should be . the Bitmap version uses around 400K! Besed 016400 25 "


"REVIEW MAGIC POCKETS MAGIC POCKETS Snowy wastelands are full of danger 350g Go ape in the jungle section A POCKET POWER The type of item to be collected by the Bitmap Kid depends upon the amount of baddies killed. Each time a nasty is wiped out the item count is increased by one, allowing bigger and better items to be collected every time a monster is destroyed. Objects available range from sweeties, which add points to the Kid's score, to energy-boosting coffee cups and extra life-giving bottles of milk! Lucky enough to be treated to an early preview of Pockets, I knew we were all in for a bit of Bitmap brilliance once again and here it is at last! Magic Pockets is just that: Magic. It may have taken a while in the making. but rest assured that Renegade have spent that time fine tuning the game until it plays like a dream. It's easy to become lost in Pocketland whilst battling through the screens against enemies so cute it's almost a crime to dust them and time flies as you venture just that bit further cos the desire to find out what comes next just grows and grows. Graphically it's excellent (even if we've already seen the style before in Gods) and the soundtrack, as usual, is superb. Better looking than Kylie Minogue and full of more features than Betty Boo's bicycle shorts, Magic Pockets is something to sing about. My advice is to buy this a bit quick Do, do, do do...

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .00 BY SEGA h no! Whilst Mickey Mouse, the sorceror's apprentice, was catching up with a spot of well-earned kip, an evil wind from atop Bald Mountain has descended onto the castle and whisked away the musical notes from the sorceror's magical music book, depositing them throughout the land of Fantasia! Never one to shy away from a challenge, or perhaps because he'll be for it if his master returns, Mickey picks up a few spells and leaves the castle to search for the missing notes. But Fantasia is a large and dangerous world for a little mouse to be alone in and each of its four lands hold surprises galore. Can Mickey brave the terrors of crocodiles, killer mushrooms and, of course, the dancing broomsticks, retrieve the notes and get back safely? If one mouse can triumph, it's got to be Mickey! MOUSEY BONUS BUSINESS! If Mickey is lucky, he'll be able to collect special items which either add to his score or increase his strength and magic powers. SPELL BOOKS: Increase magic points and add to the score STARS: Give Mickey more Hearts and bonus points CRYSTAL RASPOTIONS.DINOSAUR EGGS: Bonus points Fantasia is one of the most eagerly awaited games on the Megadrive and so it comes as a bit of a surprise to discover that it's a crock of old pants. The scenario is based around the Disney cartoon and soundtrack, a shame then, that the music is one of the weaker points of the game. There's no doubting that the graphics are delightful, but the appalling sprite collision detection and unforgiving gameplay spoil the effect. The Mickey sprite is nigh on perfect, but you only have to look at an enemy sprite to lose a life. This makes the game quite stupidly difficult and frustration is the only feeling you'll have after playing. Sloppy programming and poor design have ruined what could have been one of the best Megadrive games ever. If you want a decent platform game, then check out Sonic or even the original Mickey Mouse game Castle of Illusion. FRANK MICKEY'S MAGIC MOMENTS Mickey is capable of using two types of magic little spells and big spells. The little spells use up one magic point (Mickey begins the game with three) and is use. ful for getting rid of small enemies. As you'd expect, the big spell is necessary to wipe out larger baddies and, as it's a heftier spell than its more miniscule counterpart, uses a full three points. O'CONNOR "


"IREVIEW FACING THE MUSIC.. Not only does finding a musical note take Mickey one step nearer to his goal of finding all of the sorceror's music, but picking one up causes him to glow, making him immune to the attacks of the creatures of Fantasia. Be warned, though, that this invincibility lasts for only a short time... 1x SCORE 800 The second Mickey Mouse game to hit the Megadrive is, like its Castle Of Illusion forerunner, awash with beautiful, cartoon-quality graphics which fully capture the spirit of the Fantasia feature-length cartoon. Mickey himself even has that cute swaying motion associated with those very early MM cartoons! Coupled with an array of listenable classical ditties, you'd think Fantasia bears all the hallmarks of a classic nostalgia trip. Sadly though, the fruit which was close to ripening withered and died from a disease known as Frustraticus Playabiliti. This game is so agonisingly difficult that even the most patient gamer would have his temper sorely tested, so you can imagine the expletives hollered around the CVG office when we picked up the pad, pressed the start button and spent what seemed like years trying to get out of the castle without being scalded by cauldrons, swept up by broomsticks and molested by mushrooms. If there's any justice in the world, whoever did the playtesting for Fantasia ought to be standing in the dole queue at least, or standing in front of a firing squad at best. The game promised so much and delivered so little.

"IZREVIEW NES BY ACTIVISION ETBA RA In the 51st Century the Galaxy's most popular sport is Turbocraft racing. This sport is played by the universe's most dangerous psy chopaths and watched by vast audiences. It's time to put on your special Turbopants and head for the most dangerous parts of the solar system, in a quest for money and glory. Actually, the money is a bit more important than the glory! You start off racing your craft around a smooth scrolling track on the planet Mercury. The craft can jump great distances and is equipped initially, with a rather groovy machine gun. This damages the other racers and more importantly, slows them down. The track is littered with obstacles, in cluding crystal barriers, landmines and rather nasty gun-turrets. Upgrading weapons is simple and you'll soon find yourself with a very porky little gunship! The action moves around the Solar System, with the ultimate destination being the icy wastes of Pluto. If you earn enough money in the early races, you can kit yourself out with a better ship, but that'll take some doing. Go for it! 512 BOOOU WXDEDO CUTTING CORNERS If you feel big and clever enough, you can cheat a little while playing the game. The simplest and most effective shortcut, is to jump across corner boundaries rather than going all the way round them. There are also on later levels, springboards and speed pads which can catapult you across chasms. On later levels, the competition cheat too, so you'd better learn fast! 109 The first thing you notice about Galaxy 5000 is the superb front end. The opening presentation screen is a hoot, shame about the music. The graphics in the game itself are excellent, with neat, well animated sprites and brilliantly fluid scrolling. The racing is frantic and learning to control your craft is half the battle. Luckily there are two methods of control, one directional, the other a rotation system (which is blimmin' tricky). There are lots of things to see and do on the racetracks, weapons pods to pick up and obstacles to destroy. There are shortcuts to learn on almost every track and these are essential for good racetimes. The game can only really be described as a cross between F Zero and Super Sprint. It takes the best gameplay features from both and the combination is one of the best racers available on the Nintendo. Watch out for the groovy sampled speech, like when you bash a racer off the track and shout, \"Scuse mel\" FRANK O'CONNOR "


"REVIEW REVIEW FACING IN THE 51EICENTURY SPACED OUT TRIP MAN! There are nine worlds to visit in Galaxy 5000 and spookily enough, that's exactly how many there are in our solar system. If you think that's uncanny, then you'll be even more shocked to discover that the whole thing is based in our very own galactic back yard. It could be very dangerous crossing the roads of Saturn with these young hooligans tearing around at speeds of up to mach 5. The race goes in order of the planet's position in relation to the sun, so Mercury is first and Pluto last. With four races on each world, that makes a total of 36 tracks to conquer, so you could be at it for quite some time. Galaxy 5000 is a fun race 'n blast, right enough, with a wealth of tricky tracks full to the brim with such terrors as spikes, gun emplacements and rocky outcrops to scupper the budding galactic boy-racer and, of course, the opposition. The forced-perspective graphic style works a treat, and the scrolling is as smooth as you could hope for. There's also some great sampled speech included in Galaxy 5000 too. in fact I'm sure one of the samples is that of Marty McFly in Back To The Future 2! So why did I come away feeling slightly iffy about the game? Well, it's primarily the awkward control method which, more often than not, sees the player either career off the side of the track into the murky blackness which is space, or jump over a hazard, only to slightly shift the controls and meet your doom that way. A joypad really isn't the best form of controller to use in this type of game, in my opinion, which is probably the main reason for the constant death which I experienced. Galaxy 5000 is a worthy enough game, no doubt about that, but I suggest you have a go before you part with your dough. YOUNES CROSAER PAUL RAND . .

"HI REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY RAZOR SOFT A hy is it that the 21st century is always a nuclear wasteland? Why can't the world turn out nice, with flowers and birds and trees? Well, for one thing, it wouldn't make a very good setting for an ultraviolent shoot 'em up so maybe it's just as well! Technocop is set (surprise, surprise) in a desolate nuclear wasteland in the 21st century. You take the role of a futuristic law enforcement agent with a big weapon and a B.A.D. attitude. The local bad guys, the D.O.A. (Dead On Arrival) are getting a bit out of hand and you have been chosen to stop them Fortunately you're equipped with some fairly serious hardware including a very tasty Lamborghini and a massively dangerous gun. The gun is loaded with bullets which explode inside the victim, turning enemy sprites into a very icky mess. Technocop turns his back as the first baddy Is attacked by the cotton wool balls of Doom SUSPECT 165000) GURE NET 0-5 F Technocop has been coming in for a bit of stick in the CVG office. I have to disagree, 'cos I think it's quite a jolly little game at least in the short term. It does have its strong points, such as the fast, realistic scrolling road in the chase section and the oh-so-sicko twitching of the corpses of criminals when they've been blasted. Not only that, your James Bond-like character can also blow holes into little kids! However, Technocop does trip over its laces on more than one occasion, the most obvious reason being the sparseness of both gaming stages. On that subject, there simply isn't enough variety in them, each stage looking and playing the same as the last. I'd definitely give this one a try in the shop before making any sort of purchase decision, but overall it gets the Rand thumbs up as a pretty decent little racing blaster with a fair few extras thrown in. 222000 SUSPECT LOCATED. 2:50 IET PAUL RAND 036 "


"REVIEW VERY HARD DRIVIN' Technocop is played in two sections, the first and most graphically attractive is a driving sim with heavy Roadblasters influences. You have a Top mounted cannon which you can use to blast your opponents off the road, but it's one helluva lot more fun to ram them as you draw level! The driving can be tricky, esREQUIRED TIHE OF pecially when cars appear SIE 22 ARRIURL! 3:35 from nowhere over the crest DISTANCE TO SCENE OF CRIME: 0.1 of a hill but the corners 2000 7500 aren't particularly sharp and automatic gears ease the stress a little. This bit goes The next section is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up, looking on for a set time limit, after suspiciously like Rolling Thunder. These bits are very short, sim which the game style ply shoot anybody you come across (except for the cute kids) changes drastically and capture the guy you're after. He's hidden somewhere in a building and is very hard to find, let alone kill. To do this, you change your ammunition to a specially weighted net. If you can't be bothered trapping him, just shoot the sucker to be on the safe side. There are 11 of these nasty geezers to catch and so you could be at ll for quite some time, OCOD This weird kind of hybrid game is usually only used as a film licence. This time, however, there's not a famous name in sight. Technocop has some fairly reasonable graphics, at least during the driving section, but these start to look a little dodgy when the shoot 'em up section gets under way. The main problem with Technocop is repetition. It may sound like a bit of a bargain getting two distinctly different game styles for the price of one, but the value for money starts to sink pretty quickly when you discover that they're both mind-numbingly dull. Still, the sound effects are pretty spanky and I suppose the game does have its own sense of humour. For example, shooting old ladies pushing prams knocks 5000 points off your score, so don't blimmin' well do it. Technocop is a game which could have been quite superb, but in my opinion some pretty poor programming and overall bad design have ruined a nice idea which could have been turned into something special.

"KA NG THANA I CAN'T GET 'EM UP LETTER FROM AMERICA? Dear Yob. As a Canadian I first saw your magazine by accident. I was fascinated at first glance to see what was happening on the other side of the world. Living next to the USA I get to see all the latest products (not as early as Japan, but definitely earlier than the official versions of your machines). Games like Super Mario 3 have been out for a long time along with others like Mega Man 3, Double Dra. gon 3. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Battletoads (all for Nintendo)! Super Mario 3 has been out since March 1990! On the computer front, the PC is by far the most popular computer here. No system even comes close to what PCs sell, in games accessories or new systems. The Amiga, while the second most popular computer, has only minimal support. It still does pretty well though. The Atari ST has very small support. It only survives in very large cities and then just barely. I live in a City with 600,000 people in it and nobody! know has heard of it and no stores sell it's software or computers, I think it will be gone from our continent in a few years. Finally, what are Spectrum and Amstrad computers like (sound and graphics)? What is the difference between a Pal and Scart Super Famicom as this machine is coming out here this fall as the Super NES. Stephan Cress Winnipeg, MB, Canada. YOB: This letter is full of good points. It's just a shame your prose has about as much life as Barry Manilow's backing singers. I think he's from Canada too, or somewhere equally useless. INNIPEG. MOC Dear Yob. I am writing out of concern for the high scores section of your magazine. In my opinion certain scores should be disallowed as they are not achieved by the names beside them. (Who says? . YOB). These scores are simply what the player COULD get if he were to sit at his machine for a few days. A prime example of this is Daniel Sullivan's 99,999,900 for Mickey Mouse on the Megadrive. I myself sent in a score of 1,067,300, which took three to four hours of constant play at a point in the game where I could rack up scores quite quickly. If I were to assume that he used the same point it would still have taken him 396 hours which translates into 16.5 days of constant play. No matter how good the game is, nobody could do that without inserting a pump-action shotgun into their earhole and pulling the trigger. Now you may think I'm writing this letter out of self pity because none of my scores have been printed, but my letter is merely a warning against High Scores becoming nothing more than scores fantasised by certain players. All the real scorers out there must feel exactly like I do when some jock stain sends in an im possible score. PS Allan Brett Nottingham WHO'S A BLACKEARED YOB: Crumbs! The guardian of high scores has spoken! You gotta know CVG has some really mean games players and if we really think a score is a load of old tosh, that's what we'll do to it. Anyway I've stuck a bazooka in my ear loadsa times and I'm not even slightly sick of Mickey Mouse, even if he is a black-eared little wimp. That said, I'm sick to death of you. . WINNEb. "


"WE JUST CAN'T PLAY THE GAME! Dearest Yob, Having been an avid fan of CVG for several years, I thought it neccessary to air my views on a topic I feel strongly about software piracy. Especially on ST and Amiga games, this crime is getting very common and for one simple reason: the price of orig. inal software is just far too high. I mean, you pay - to buy a machine and then have to fork out another  for one measley game. Who can blame people for owning a few copied games? After all, they're cheap. Could anyone please explain to me why 16-bit games are so expensive? How much would it cost to produce a box? 50p? The discs, 75p? The instructions, 25p? Look at the profit on one game alone, never mind 50,000. Companies like US Gold and Ocean must have profits of millions of pounds and are ripping people off. The software houses are practically forcing owners to break the law. This is not good news. A Brownie Aberdeen, Scotland. SILLY SPECCY SADNESS Dear Yob. Don't laugh but I'm the very proud owner of a Speccy +2 with a hell of a lot of games ranging from Punchy to Robocop 2. I'm wondering whether to sell my Spectrum and put the mony towards a 16-bit computer or stay with my old friend. If I couldn't afford a 16-bit machine, what about buying a Console (extremely cool but the games are rather pricey on my under paid paper round wage)? Could you see into the future and see the Super Famicom coming out at an extremely low price? By the way, if you don't print this letter it proves to the readers that you are a wimp. Sorry, couldn't resist that one. Also my friend will give me a Tenner if this gets printed, which isn't the real reason I write I really just wanted you're super cool, hip and trendy advice. A Spectrum Owner Leicester YOB: If you actually have any friends they'd better not give you any cash, or else. If you read CVG regularly you'd know which machine you want, but obviously you don't so you won't. Oh dear. If FAST RENT FRIEN YOB: You're talking through your tiny sporran. We've been through this piracy business before and all you deadheads have got to realise that piracy will only put companies out of business and restrict the amount of software generally available. As far as money is concerned, packaging is only one aspect of the cost. Do you think that games grow on axe handles? They involve many programmers and developers all of whom have to be paid and don't forget the shops and distributors take their cut too, plus advertising costs and film licence payments etc. It's people like you who bring down the intelligence average of gamers and give everyone a bad name, so put that in your Scotch egg and shove it. JOLLY JOKING JAPES Dear Yob, First off, here are a few jokes for your lively pages: Q: What do you get if you cross Julian Rignall with Tim Boone?

Good people that have spent time and 13 pence, To write to you and then, You insult them and don't answer their questions, Here's an example from a section: A boy writes in and wants to know Why the STE is better than the STFM and you know, Because you answer, \"Why do you care? I bet he'd like to pull out your hair, While you're hanging upside down, Until you answer, \"Because of its sound\". And while you're screaming I'd love to be there, To see him ripping out your hair. He'd be shouting, \"You stupid prat, I bought a Speccy 'cos I thought ST's were crap. And all because of your stupid letter, So I'm going to make you regret it and you'd better.\" Yob, oh Yob. you'd be in a state, There'd be no more violence, no more hate, And especially no more cocky remarks, Like \"PS I think you're a waste of space'.

"REVIEW FAMICOM BY CAPCOM .00 It all began in the small, Middle-Eastern province of Kutal. Kutal had for years been in a state of civil war, fuelled by the terrorist of ganisation Project 4. One-time arms dealers, Project 4's trade had been slacking off due to an unexpected outbreak of peace and with Kutal the only country in the world still in conflict, the bad guys weren't about to let their lucrative trade slip away. Thousands of miles away in Washington, the UN Security Council sat down to discuss the situation once more. The toughest sanctions since the 1990s had been put in place and appropriate threats were made, all to no avail. This called for drastic action. A proposal was tabled to send in the crack UN Squadron, the most lethal rapid-reaction force available. The vote was cast, a unamimous de cision returned. The three-man team were on their way to Kutal within twenty-four hours, ready to rock. ORE 66600 LEVEL 5 POWTOTAL $ 189800 ma A This boat spilled your pint, so make it pay!

"REVIEW PSPC UPDATE UN Squadron already exists on a wide variety of home computers, thanks to US Gold. They're not bad at allbut not a patch on this! Ere, that's one of them Stealth bomber fings, innit! ODS Surprisingly enough, I've never had the opportunity to play the UN Squadron coin-op, so I can't compare this Super Famicom conversion to its arcade parent. What I can tell you is that to my mind this is probably the best shoot 'em up availJable on the Fammy at the moment even better than Super R-Type! Graphically no-one could fail to be impressed, especially by the Incredibly detailed backdrops which left me quite simply thunderstruck. A lot of time and effort has obviously gone into making UN Squadron (or Area 88, as it's known in the Land Of The Rising Sun) as visually impressive as possible. In one sense this is a shame, because it sounds as if the programmers were a bit pushed for time to produce the music, which isn't that far removed from a Megadrive game. Fortunately, the tunes aren't off-putting in any way, and they're adequately propped up by the impressive FX. What really makes UN Squadron such a fabulous blast is that magic shoot 'em up ingredient playability. It has tons of the stuff thoughout its three difficulty levels, misleadingly called Easy, Normal and Hard when they should be named Tough, Sweaty and No Way Matey! This game gets the definite thumbs up, and if the coin-op is anything similar stand aside while I step up for a blast... PAUL RAND On my gosh, that cave looks a bit spooky "


"REVIEW UN SQUADRON REVIEW LEVEL 4 powr WHAT'S A UN 9155500 L41 SQUADRON? There isn't really such a force as the UN Squadron at this moment in time. The nearest there is to these guys is a UN Peacekeeping Force. After a war or some other conflict, and should the UN Security Council vote favourably, a small \"army\" of around 3-5,000 soldiers is gathered from various United Nations member states. They're given natty blue UN PSS berets so as not to annoy the locals and are usually given THANKS! the job of monitoring ceaseThanks to Advanced Confires basically keeping opsole Entertainment (071 383 A Just look at those posing sides apart and un0482) for the loan of the car gorgeous clouds! able to shoot holes in one another.

CRUSADER THUNDERBOLT2 X LEVEL 5 TIGER SHARE I've seen more than enough whiffy World War Il sideways scrolling shoot 'em ups to know you have to be careful with this type of game. Luckily UN Squadron on the Fammy is a total hoot from start to finish (well, start to-umquite a way in!) This game has everything a great shooter should beautiful graphics, incredible backdrops, great explosions and above all five star gameplay! Everything works like a dream to present every player with a real challenge at whichever level you choose. It's true that the programmers seem to have sacrificed sound to make everything else that bit better, but you'll quickly forgive them as you wade through the on-screen mayhem and blow the bad guys back to wherever the hell they think they came from. Like Randy, I have to confess I never saw UN Squadron in the arcades but who cares when you can play a console conversion this good in the comfort of your own home! All of a sudden, UN Squadron gives the mighty Super R-Type a serious run for your money and if you want a game with plenty of challenge then this is the one for you!

"REVIEW: MEGADRIVE .99 CINDERELT BY SEGA Dam! Pow! Kerblamm! It's death dealin' time again! Just when Dyou thought that Final Fight on the Famicom had the genre sewn up, along comes a Megadrive beat 'em up to knock its block off! Streets of Rage bears more than a passing resemblance to Final Fight. It's a horizontally scrolling Kung Fu riot featuring a to tally brill two player mode. Mr Big, the rather large Mafioso boss, has taken over the town You and one of your two pals have to find the big bellied crime, creep kick his royal fatness all over the town. Each one of you (two, guys and a gal) has a wide range of martial arts moves at your dis posal. There are special secret moves and possibly the most out rageous smart bomb the world has ever seen. The goons come in all shapes and sizes and it's up to you and your hombres to deal with them. Use your feet, fists or any of the weapons the bad guys drop (including a canister of CS gas) to dish out the destruction. Strangely enough, there's nobody to rescue no damsel in distress and no kidnapped children. Just punches, slaps, kicks and serious fighting. Cool! Kerblomml Blane calls up some fiery help from the local cops PAUSE I almost wet myself and called the police when we first plugged in the Streets of Rage cart. The game starts up with a stupendous opening sequence and a great house remix of some fabulous oriental music. From here on things just get better and better. The startup screen allows you to choose from three characters, two guys and a girl. Two of these can play simultaneously and help each other through the battle ahead. On the flipside, you can brawl with your friends if they get in your way or even if they don't! The graphics are gorgeous, the sprites beautifully animated and full of life. The backdrops on certain sections are almost photographic in quality and portray a city full of disease, squalor and Ninja death squads. It fast, mindless, pointless violence is your cup of tea, then get hold of Streets of Rage and have those Famicom owners wishing they'd never upgraded. Here's the game that actually makes the Fami look a bit feeble and that's saying something! FRANK O'CONNOR 054 "


"L REVIEW YEWE KFAST MEER PAUSE Acrobatic kung-fu antics as you unleash a backbreaking movi CHOOSE YOUR HERO! Here's a quick lowdown on the fighters at your disposal as you take on the mighty Mister Big and his well 'ard deputies of doom. Each fighter has his or her own special skills, and you'll soon choose a favourite with which to kick some butt... TUAL UOL R USER NE ADAM: This is one cool dude. His speciality is boxing and very good he is at it too! He prefers to hit the goons with a flying drop kick though, has a nice line in surprise back kicks and looks quite a bit like Mean Machines hero Oz Browne. Amazing! OK amartypents. you noticed that Streets of Rage has a different little on this Japanese version AXEL: A world class martial artist whose tactic is to hit first and ask questions later. He may look a bit soft, but the boy is fast. He also looks suspiciously like CVG street urchin Paul Rand. In credible! PRESS START BUTTON ASSI SEGA MUSIC 1991 YUZO KOSHIRO BLAZE: Blaze is not only gorgeous, she's also a judo expert and likes nothing better than grappling with sweaty men in the rougher parts of town. Blaze is more than a match for most of the crims in the city, and looks surprisingly like CVG designer Yvette Nicholls. Stupendous! 055 "


"REVIEW STREETS OF RAGE STREETS OF RAGE Blaze kicks ass ROGUES GALLERY There are lots of very shady characters in the city, so you should be careful who you talk to. Some of the guys you'll encounter are just plain old sluggers who try to bop you one on the head. Others will carry weapons and be more than a match for you in terms of strength and speed. The end of level baddies are the real problem though, and these guys come in all shapes and sizes. Teamwork is essential at this point and helping your mate out of a bad situation makes you feel all warm and gooey inside. WWW THE THREE AMIGOS! There are three heroes to choose from in Streets of Rage, each with their own special abilities. You have to decide which combination of speed, strength and agility suits your style of play. Axel, for example, is fast but not as strong as Adam. It is possible to link arms and use each other's bodies as weapons, but doing this in the heat of the action is tricky to say the least. If you don't get on with your teammates, you can turn the game into a grudge match, beating up your friends and competing for weapons and bonuses. The first time I saw this ! almost wet Frank's trousers too. The Megadrive has been screaming for a truly brilliant beat 'em up for years and now Streets of Rage knocks the competition into a cocked hat! Ir Beautifully presented, the game smacks of quality from the moment you slap in the cart and prepare to slap heads. The gameplay is totally wicked. Each fighter has his or her own characteristics, but you'll soon choose a favourite with which to kick ass. Graphically excellent, the backdrops are something else again. With gusts of wind blowing dead leaves across the road and posters fluttering in the breeze, you really do get the feel you're fighting in Sleeze City. But for me the thing which really makes the game is the sheer number of moves at your fighter's disposal, especially when fighting with a chum. Watch those bad guys count the spinning stars as you dust them down with a flying kick after using your buddy as a human trampolene! Buy this and soak your pants it's that good!

"ROS Actual 16 Bit Screens THE NEXT MILLENIUM It is the end of the 31st Century. Nearly one thousand years ago man colonised the moon, and from there created a range of human mutations which were left to develop other planets. At the same time, life on earth was destroyed by a cataclysmic climatic change. Now the mutant races are at war with each other, and man has returned to Earth, rebuilt civilisation, and forgotten about past adventures. Deep in Earth City, plans have been made to explore space again. The race has started to develop Earth's resources, to research new technology, to build for future adventures. You must control the training, research, resources, production and stores of Earth City in a complex strategic battle to maximise the planet's supplies. You must construct and pilot the hi-tech space shuttles and ships needed for mankind to venture out into the furthest reaches of the war-torn solar system. Operation Deuteros has begun.

"NEOGEO BASEBALISTA NEOGEO NEOGEO 15  It's got to be the swankiest home console money can buy-boasting full-blown arcade experiences to enjoy at home. Virtually an arcade in your front room, the Neo, Geo is still the Rolls Royce of console gaming. So why isn't everybody blowing six bells out of the bad guys on this little black box full of wonders? Simple up until now the machine and its games cost a bloody bomb With a price tag of around  for the console and a whacking great  each cartridge for the games, the Neo Geo remained one of those machines everybody drooled over but nobody played outside the arcades. Now Console Concepts have slashed back the price of the Geo to a much more reasonable , with power supply and nifty joystick thrown in. They've also been able to hack back the price of the games to  for new releases and a damned rea sonable  for the old arcade classics including the likes of Nam 75, Magician Lord and Baseball Stars. The lads at CVG decided to take a closer look at SNK's expensive little superstar, and review the latest games now available for the machine. Take it away, boys.. INSIDE THE AMAZING BIG BOX OF TRICKS So what makes the Neo Geo such a wonderful machine even if it does cost the earth? First off, the machine's designed to handle a stunning 330 megs of information using two procesa 16-bit 68000 and 8-bit Z80A. The machine can shift at a fair old pace, delivering super-smooth graphics and capable of displaying 4096 colours on-screen at the same time! The machine can also handle up to 380 sprites (and that's a LOT of alien scumbags to blow away), and features 15 chan nels of sound! The Neo Geo is a slick black console, and really looks the part you can almost feel the power hidden inside the machine. The joysticks are almost as big as machine, but surprisingly easy to use once you balance it in your lap and wiggle away. The buttons take a fair bit of hammering, too surviving days of thumping from the CVG crew putting the boot in on the brill King Of The Monsters. One very nice feature of the machine is the memory card which allows you to store the high scores and position you racked up at home to drop those jaws when you slot it into your local arcade's machine and play away on level six billion! The size of a credit card, you can store up to 27 seperate games positions on one of these little babies. Now that's sexy... So what's the verdict? The upshot of all this is that the Neo Geo is one helluva games machine and a wonderful piece of kit to own. Head to head with the Famicom, it definitely comes out on top in terms of sheer power. But even with the recent price drop, the Neo Geo is just too far out of most people's price range to make it really worthwhile. Our review machine and cartridges come courtesy of Console Concepts (0782 712759). If you think you're ready for the super l eague of gaming and want to join the exclusive Neo Geo owners' club, give them a call for all the info. 060 "


"ALPHA MISSION  BY SNK GUARDIAN TM narNeo ick box bomb! each ody more een ed reaLord erstar, KS TEN years ago the SYD super jet plane kicked ten bells out of a massive alien invasion force in the original Alpha Mission and, since that time, everything in the garden had been rosy. But now in the year 2525, the baddies suitably re-armed, they're making another bid for domination of space. Time for the Leg endary Hero to come out of retirement, power up the dreaded Armoured Scam Object and take to the stars once more. One or two fighters can take on the outer-space onslaught, each player capable of increasing his firepower by shooting pods and collecting the weaponry released. Not only that, there's the chance to pick up super-bolt-ons which offer devastating weapons for a limited amount of time. Considering the Neo Geo is simply a coin-op in a smaller box, it's only fair to expect software of arcade quality, especially at the prices that are charged. With Alpha Mission II, that's exactly what you're given a hard and fast blaster full to the brim with extra weaponry and lethal enemies, all picked out in gorgeous detail. Not only are the graphics of high quality, the sound and music are completely mindblowing, consisting mainly of raucous guitar tracks which give the player the Impression of listening to a heavy metal cassette whilst the killing ensues. This really is one tough game and, what makes it even more worthwhile, you aren't given infinite continues so you're going to need to be really hot if you want to get to the finish even on Easy levell The prices for Neo Geo games are huge, but if you're fortunate enough to be able to afford a cartridge this year, go for Alpha Mission II.

It takes the form of a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up, with lots of extra weapons and end of level baddies. The game follows much in the mould of every other vertical shooter from Xevious onwards. Bearing an almost uncanny re semblance to Taito's arcade smash Flying Shark, you have to guide a rather groovy boat-plane through a veritable storm of missiles and bullets. The enemy pile in, mostly from above, bu the occasional sneaky fighter creeps in from the back. There isn't really all that much in the way of spanky power ups, but you can enhance the bog-standard machine gun and boost your firepower. End of level baddies are to be quite honest, complete sissies, They bimble onto the screen with the grace and poise of a tap dancing slug on valium. A couple of shots and a smart bomb and off they shuffle to the great end of level in the sky. BY SNK GHOST PILOTS 8-8--8TOP Ooh er, there you are, 120 big ones clutched in your sweaty fist. You hand it over and recieve in return a cartridge the size of a hardback novel. Get it home, plug it into your Neo Geo and what have you got? An average vertically scrolling shoot 'em up with average graphics and reasonable sound. This in itself wouldn't be much of a disaster, but after paying 120 quid, you expect that much worth of entertainment. That's something you just don't get from Ghost Pilots. It has nothing new to offer and in some ways, is a step backwards for the genre. There are tons of better vertical shooters around and for the price of the cartridge alone, you could buy yourself a PC Engine and a copy of Gunhed. The game has no saving graces. It's so completely mediocre, you'll won der if the programmers knew the machine was a powerful 16 bit monster when they blatantly copied Flying Shark. An expensive excercise in poor design and dodgy pro gramming which, frankly, sucks. FRANK 5 MEGA NEO GEO GRAPHICS 76 SOUNDS 68 PLAYABILITY 70 LASTABILITY 69 OVERALL 68 062 O'CONNOR "

Whoops, there goes a n tower block! Oh dear one of them's just trodden on a liner! Watch that bridge one of them's just walked into it... Yes, folks here's your chance to be a monster, lay waste to en tire cities and beat up other monstrous muthas at the same time! It's 1996, the ozone layer is no more and the whole world has gone totally bonkers. Huge monsters suddenly appear from no where, and as soon as they meet each other they just have to fight to the finish. Cities are laid waste by these ferocious foes as they stomp across skyscrapers, trash entire streets with one kick and pick up ocean liners and trains to throw at each other! Each monstrous fighter has individual skills and talents, and learning all about them, is half the fun. Battling through cities across Japan, these heavyweight hulks care only for one thing beating the crap out of each other. Is there any chance for humanity? No way! This game has gone down a riot in the CVG office. It's a beat 'em up to the max, so full of laffs and surprises you just have to keep coming back for more. With six mega monsters to choose from Geon the Godzilla is my favourite you'll quickly learn to use different tricks and tactics against your foes. Play against the computer and the game's a great laff. Take on a chum and it becomes a hilarious free-for-all as you lumber around the screen kicking the ass off each other. The graphics are nothing short of superb, with a real Japanese B-movie flavour backed up by the tacky sound. With bonus points on offer for buidlings, streets, ships and planes trashed in the process there's always something new to see, and it'll take quite a while before you tire of this. If I'd first met this game in the arcades I'd be a lot poorer now. Thank Neo it's on the Geo. Hurrah! TIM BOONE 50 NEO GEO GRAPHICS 91 SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 92 LASTABILIT MEGA enco OVERALL 91 "

"Welcome to the great CVG boy racer's pullout guide to the hottest racing games around! Over the next fabulous four pages we'll be giving you the full lowdown on some of the big burn-ups coming your way soon. So belt up and strap in for some high speed thrills and spills as CVG boy racer FRANK O'CONNOR takes a close look at some of the goodies you'll all be playing pretty darned soon. With the red-hot Lotus II, Formula One Grand Priz and Megadrive Outrun among these fastlane goodies, here's the hottest guide to the biggest racers around. Take it away, Frankie! TM OUT RUN HITS THE MEGADRIVE Out Run. The game that spawned a thousand sequels (well, nearly) has finally appeared on the Sega Megadrive. Is it any good? Well it certainly looks the part, with the graphics being almost identical to the arcade version. Tunes too, are brilliantly well catered for, with all the original soundtracks and one new track. The main problem with the game is the ease of play. Everyone who's had a go has completed it first time, even on the hardest setting. There are a couple of weird points, like the fact that some of the tracks come in the wrong order and the slightly iffy background switching. Great for younger players, but veterans should look elsewhere for driving thrills. PIBICA STAGE "


"VGROTE FORMULA ONE ACTION Microprose are about to launch one of the most impressive looking racing sims ever seen on a home micro. The game, Formu la One Grand Prix, is being developed by Stunt Car Racer Wizard Geoff Crammond and features plenty of tracks, loads of polygons and dreamy gameplay. We've seen a pre-production version and it looks superb. The car handles brilliantly and with seven gears including reverse it'll take some getting used to. The most impressive aspect of the gameplay is the sheer speed at which things move. The other racers speed by, sometimes crashing with spectacular results. Apparently all the tracks have been reproduced as faithfully as possible to their real life counterparts. These tracks include all the famous ones, like Brands Hatch, Monaco and Le Mans. The realistic movements of both the cars and the track are a joy to behold and the game features some fairly jaw-dropping graphic routines. If it shapes up well, Formula One Grand Prix could be the game to steal the crown from Indy 500. Available soon on PCs, Amigas and STs everywhere. "

"LOTUS II THRILLS 'N' SPILLS!! YAHOO! The sequel to last year's best racing game the incredible Lotus Turbo Esprit Challenge is almost here! Gremlin's smash hit scooped lots of awards last year and they're looking to repeat that success with a bigger, better, faster sequel. The game features the same split screen mode used in the first game, but with an option for single players to use the whole screen. Eight stages full of surprises and dangerously hostile weather conditions mean that Lotus 2 has a lot more to offer than its predecessor. Most important of all is the fact that up to four players can race with a couple of linked Amigas, a feature normally found in expensive flight sims. Loook out for it on an ST or Amiga near you soon. Tim and Jaz have already played an early version of Lotus II and reckon it's looking pretty darned brill. Stay tuned for more info! THE FASTEST FLOP Fastest 1 is another Megadrive split screen racing romp-o. rama, this time with slightly more sophisticated Formula 1 racing cars. This one to be perfectly honest looks a bit on the dreadful side. The graphics look like fairly poor Master System efforts and the car handles like its being pushed through a vat of mushy peas. The split screen mode offers some attraction, but in the end only serves to double the horrifyingly sluggish gameplay. Don't invite your mates round and inflict this one on them or you might end up a sad, lonely friendless person. L EDUSEO 044 9833 09R CAUSE000 000  MEGATRAX SPLIT SCREEN MALARKEY! Anyone out there played Namco's spanky coin-op Four Trax? It features those all terrain four wheeled motor bike thingies and a lot of mud. Well, you can now enjoy hot mud soaked action on your Megadrive in the form of Megatrax a slightly altered version of the arcade machine. You can race a friend simultaneously around the tracks, leaping ramps and avoiding other racers. The split screen mode is used to good effect, but the game itself is a little dull. The quad bikes handle badly and the graphics are simplistic to say the least. Tunes and sound effects are for the most part dreadful, so have a go before you part with your hard earned beer tokens. THE HEAT IS ON! Converted from the Jaleco coin-op by Imageworks, Cisco Heat is a racer in the tradition of Out Run and Chase HQ, with a choice of two cars. Both have considerable differences. The first is a big American machine very fast, but is a pig to drive. The second is a souped up Nissan, not quite as fast, but with smart handling. The other racers do their best to get in your way, but beeping the horn causes them to move aside. There BURN 'EM UP Hot Rubber isn't as you might expect a new piece of Scandinavian educational\" software, it is in fact the latest racing game from Palace Software. Two wheels are the order of the day here, as you scream round the tarmac on a throbbing lump of hot piston pumping power. This split screen racer will appear very shortly accross most eight and 16 bit formats. It could be the mother of all racers. MPH are lots of things to avoid, including oil slicks, pedestrians, traffic jams at crossroads and the inevitable Cisco tramcars. Hurrah! The team responsible for converting this massively impressive coin-op is Ice Software, the guys who converted Out Run. Rest assured we'll bring you a full review just as soon as we can! "

So let's get down to them, shall we? (ooh yes, lets, Paul!). 1. Turn off your engine to make the tightest turns possible. 2: Dive into the clouds to lose your opponents. 3. Always approach an enemy from the rear, as their guns are front-mounted 4. Your plane can climb higher than those of your opponents: therefore, make the enemy sitting ducks by high flying and attacking them in a circular dive. "

"HIGH SCORES The summer slump of chronic scores is almost over and Christmas is looming on the horizon. All you lot have obviously returned from whichever foul places you choose to hide during your hols, since the scores have stormed into the office for this issue. That's not to say you've been frantically buying new games. Apart from one or two hot new releases, most of the tables are made up of older titles. That's all set to change, I'm sure, the colder it gets and the hotter you wimps become! GAMES GALORE GAMES GALORE GAMES AMIGA Top scores-a-plenty in the Amiga table, with a fine PGA Tour score topping the chart. In fact, it's sim city in the Amiga chart this issue, what with EA's fab golf title, Kick Off 2 and Their Finest Hour. Whatever happened to the shoot 'em ups, eh?

"AMIGA SUPERCARS GBH .99 In the future, all car races will be like this. Kitted out with the relevant armoury, bands of drivers head out onto the highways and attempt to come first using any means possible and if that calls for such drastic action as bombarding the opposition with missiles, then so be it. With the money made for a respectable placing, new cars and better equipment can be bought, and if the racer has enough of a silver coating on his tongue, he may be able to blag a bit of sponsorship, too. Supercars on the Amiga is racing in the true Super Sprint fashion, only this game has twenty-seven huge, multi-directional scrolling tracks instead of about four static little tiddlers. This is race-driving for hard men and, even though the graphics verge on the average, the action more than makes up for that.

Rightly so, considering he's a green, spherical object trapped in the thirty-two lands which make up the Cloud Kingdoms by Baron von Bonsai, who won't let him out until he's collected all the magic crystals scattered around. Needless to say, there's a load of baddies kicking around, watching and waiting to kick you into touch not to mention various obstacles to hold up Terry in his quest. Cloud Kingdoms is a superb game, reminiscent of cutesy console cartridge. The various baddies such as magnets and eight-balls all look superb and the action is certainly hectic enough.

Anyway, Grandslam have produced this game-of-theteam, featuring a Kick Off-style bird's eye view and the whole of the England Squad to choose from, including digitised piccies of each player! Unfortunately, the view is the only part of England Championship Special which has anything in common with my favourite game of all time the rest of this effort is a travesty of the national sport. The players all bunch together in their area of the pitch, so you'll have all the defenders, midfield and forwards in little groups, leaving no. scope for wing-play and such. The game is, frankly, a sick joke, and should only be loaded so as to scare the kids into doing their homework. OVERALL 21% O00000000 LTD. PRISES ITED. 6 ZAX. "

"for: FOOTBALLER OF THE YEAR 2 GBH .99 Become the top striker in the country in this re-release from new budget label GBH, not by playing football but by buying goal cards and answering various footballing questions. There's the possibility of transfers, providing you've put away enough goals and, if you've done really well for your side, there's even the opportunity of a call. up from the internationals! Footballer of the year is little more than a football quiz game great if you're well clued-up on the national game, not so hot if you aren't. The programmers haven't exactly gone to town spicing up the pres. entation either: drab graphics and text-only screens do little to spark any excitement. OVERALI 60% In your town tonight: PAUL RAND introduces C64 Bytesize, in which the Northern know-it-all imparts his worldly knowledge, and writes a few reviews... SHINOBI RED HEAT HIT SQUAD .99 Become Arnie Shwarzenegger and take on the role of Captain Ivan Danko as he tracks down the evil Russian drug dealer Viktor Rostavili across four stages in the game based on the money-spinning movie, originally released at full price by Ocean. Beginning in a Soviet sauna, the action then switches to the streets of Chicago, where Russia's hottest cop must tackle the city's toughest gang the Cleanheads. The game is displayed in a cinematic style, with only the top half of the characters in view. Not only does this add atmosphere to Red Heat, it also allows for some pretty huge graphics to shift about at a fair old pace. Couple the four main stages with a few bonus screens such as crushing rocks with your bare hands by frantically waggling the joystick and there you have it: an above average interpretation of a great movie. MASTERTRONIC .99 Oh lordy! Bwah Foo has taken hostage all the children from Joe Mushashi's school of ninja training, and threatens to kill them all if his demands aren't met. Joe, being a master at the art of ninjitsu, won't stand for such cowardice and decides to go off in search of his pupils before they cop it. What ensues is a multi-stage beat 'em up con verted from the cult coin-op, in which Joe must call upon all his ninja skills to fight his way through the henchmen of Foo, rescuing the youngsters as he finds them. Shinobi, originally released by Virgin Games, is a cracking conversion of the coin-op, featuring graphics and gameplay so close to the arcade version you'll be trying to shove ten pees into the cartridge slot of your 64! Even the shuriken-hurling bonus screen has been in cluded, almost pixel perfectly! A cracker of a budget game buy it immediately.

Containing over two hundred screens spread over five levels, Monty must collect weapons and destroy baddies, whilst ensuring he hangs onto his own life for as long as possible. The Monty Mole saga has been ongoing since, it seems, the dawn of time, exciting players each time, so it's a bit of a letdown to find that the last in the series is actually the worst due mainly to the frustrating, die-every-second gameplay. Graphics aren't too bad, but why bother when the game itself just isn't much fun? OVERALL 64% 0090 085 "

"SUPERCARS ATARI ST RICAN RESS GBH .99 Jump into the seat of your sports car and take on the other lunatics in a 27-stage race to find out just who owns the most super car. If you aren't happy with the way the vehicle is performing (and if you ve been placed high enough up the field to earn enough cash), then slope into the parts shop and acquire the relevant bits and bobs. There are weapons to buy and use if you don't think your driving skill is up to scratch, and sponsorship deals to tie up in order to get a bit more money in your racing kitty. Super Cars may not look up to much, but playing the game takes you right back to the glory days of Super Sprint, only with far superior, eight-way scrolling tracks, weapons-a-plenty and many more opponents to go up against. High-powered playability is the order of the day and, at this price, you'd be car-razy to miss out! OVERALL 89% STE IMPOSSAMOLE GBH .99 It's that Bytesize time again, with blonde bombshell PAUL RAND strutting his stuff across the ST marketplace, looking good for the ladies and taking in a few choice titles along the way... CLOUD KINGDOMS GBH .99 If round, green balls with wide eyes are your \"thang', then perhaps this could be the game for you. It stars Terry the Spheroid, whose job it is to to retrieve the magic crystals nicked by Baron von Bonsai, who has stashed them around the thirty-two areas which make up the Cloud Kingdoms. I reviewed this first time round and enjoyed it, remarking upon its Quedex style of gameplay and its jolly, consoleesque look. Cloud Kingdoms has aged well, playing more like a puzzle game than an arcade thrasher, and is well worth the dosh.

Driller, Total Eclipse, Castie Master and The Crypt (aforementioned sequel to CM). All utilising the Freescape system of 3D Construction Kit fame. All four games are of such a high quality they'd probably shift for around a tenner apiece. So at a price of just under a score for all four, we are talking bargain!

Impossamole could have been, like all the Monty games preceeding it, classic platform fare. Unfortunately, it suffers from a dodgy control system making for frustrating play.

Graphically, the game is uninspiring, but what can you do to make a dartboard exciting?

There are a couple of bonus screens too, from crushing a hot rock with your bare hands to joining together pieces of a one dollar note. Red Heat didn't exactly set the world on fire first time around, mainly due to its samey gameplay.

Things are about to change, however. A dirty great star is about to collapse and the sun around which the planet Arth orbits is about to shuttle of its mortal coil. When stars snuff it, they tend to go out with a bang, taking rather large chunks of the galaxy with them. Obviously the citizens of the planet Arth are not best pleased at this turn of events and would frankly rather it all happened somewhere else. The planet's desperate leaders have reached the bottom of the barrel and de cided to ask you for help. Things must be desperate.

What Starflight could have done without is the tedious task of having to create a new set of characters each time you begin again although there's a battery back-up to save games, in the all-important early stages of playing you'll find you'll be drawing up new crew members more often than not after inadvertantly straying into hostile territory, slagging off the lo cals and being swiftly destroyed.

Rubbish! They were created by gods in a spherical glass arena and given over to these deities who then battle it out to win overall control of the new world. But no-one would expect such powerful beings to fisticuff be tween themselves. Oh no, as usual it's the poor humans who are given that task. Each god directs a race of people, who must do whatever they can to take the planet for their god meaning they've got to pro-create to form new life, which in turn allows the pople to amass larger armies, build new structures and invent new, more de. vastating weapons. Mega-lo-Mania is a simulation of one such holy war, fought on a planet consisting of 28 islands split into groups or Epochs. Begin ning on the least technologically creative Epoch with only rocks and sticks available to use against the enemies, your God must strive to reach the last island the far-future Mother Of All Battles where your followers fight with laser weapons. And all along the way can be invented such delights as catapults, muskets, airplanes and even thermo-nuclear devices! LO QUITTER SINATRA13115AD MEGALOM THE KEY TO CONQUEST The key to success in Mega-lo-Mania lies with the power of invention. Starting with only simple sticks and stones, the further along the evolutionary scale your followers progress the better the weapons become.

"REVIEW SINATRA MI ELEMENTARY, HONESTLY! You can't build with fresh air! In order to make those new inventions come bursting into life, the people need to find elements with which to create their toys. The most basic elements can be acquired just by picking them up off the ground, but the bet ter ones needed to build the best weapons are deep underground and can only be reached by building a mine available from 3000BC. MEGA 1. MANIA Bezo 1ST EPOCH IPTIONS PLAY ISLAND The idea behind Mega-loMania is very much in the Powermonger mould become a leader of people and invent weapons to crush the opposition. This game takes the concept a stage further though, with the introduction of evolution and the ability to create some quite staggering armoury the more civilised the people become. The feeling you get when you take to the air in 1915 for the first time is immense, and just imagine the power in your hands following the invention of nukes! Graphically, Mega-lo-Mania is hardly inspiring: each island is made up of static screens containing rather flat land. But it's not this side of the game which makes it so wonderful the 800K or so of clear, sampled speech informing the player of completed weapons, offers of alliances from other gods and such like more than make up for the relative drabness of the visuals. Mega-lo-Mania is a wildly addictive game, although fairly stunted in size, consisting of only twenty-eight islands, fifteen of which I've already completed. Luckily, though, I've noticed that the next island is all but impossible to complete success. fully, but it's a fair bet that I'll be persevering with Megalo-Mania until I do, along with the rest of 'em.

The player starts each Epoch with one hundred humans initially under his power, but these men must be shared between all three islands, calling for a fair bit of strategy (and just a hint of trial and error!) in selecting the correct amount of people for each island. For example, while you may storm through one game without a hitch, you may have used too many followers and left yourself short for the remaining two! At first glance, I was tempted to write this game off as yet another Powermonger clone. How wrong can you be? In its own weird, wacky and wonderful way, Mega-lo-Mania is completely original and a whole heap of fun. The first island is a bit of a scene-setter and fairly easy, but from then on the game becomes progressively more challenging and supremely addictive. One of Mega-lo-Mania's great strengths is its subtle humour and there are some fine graphic and sonic touches to be found throughout the game as you progress ridiculously onwards to thermonuclear war. \"Ergonomically tewwific!\" burbles the machine as your minions come up with some new weapon with which to kill those poor unfortunates who happen to live next door. The game is extremely playable, but I'm not so sure how it will stand up in the long-term playability stakes. Once you've seen it all the desire to replay the game will quickly wane.

After what seems like a neverending supply of death, destruction and general mayhem in the gaming world of late, Storm get back to the cutesy, console style with Rodland and how! The concept of the game is a cross between Bubble Bobble and that age-old favourite, Panic (you know, the one where you have to hit monsters with a hammer!) which was a pull for me anyway as I love both of those classics. Then there's the graphics, as colourful and cute as even the most sickly of games. The blurb accompanying Rodland reads \"So cute, it'll make you puke.\" They weren't far wrong! With an array of superb backdrops featuring on the Amiga version, C64 Rodland has to settle for black backgrounds and fairly blocky sprites similar to Bubble Bobble. In a way this is a good thing as the unremarkable visuals allow the classy gameplay to stand out. Both games include some fine sound, adding even more to the already electric atmosphere, but it's the gameplay which you buy software for, and Rodland is stuffed brim full of that...

Now, with much more detail available on the aircraft and massive publicity due mainly to the role it played in the Gulf, the original F19 sim has been updated, tweaked and given its official name of F117-A Before flying into any one of a number of international hotspots, the Stealth pilot must first select his style onoame.

UPDATE Will Stealth Fighter 2.0 make it onto your Amiga and ST? Only time, success and the head honchos at Microprose can tell! Watch this space... F19 Stealth Fighter is my second favourite game of all-time, so I was anxious to get my mitts on the sequel and see what declassification can do to a flight sim. What Microprose have done is take the original game (which, as it turned out, wasn't that technically incorrect), added extra scenarios, beef up the graphics and fiddle with the flight mechanics to create a simulation which feels more like a brand new project than a sequel. The graphics are absolutely superb: masses of detail including what looks like lights shining in airbases! The aircraft itself is a joy to fly I advise getting hold of an analogue joystick if you don't already own one, as it gives the simulation a much better feeling of realism than when using the mouse. Something always has to be sacrificed, though, and in the case of F117-A it's the smoothness of the scrolling. At times things can become very jerky, but this can be compensated by altering the detail of the graphics to strip away the pretty but unnecessary pictures and speed up the game no end. F117-A Stealth Fighter v2.0 is the next step in home computer flight simulation a technically stunning piece of programming and an infinitely enjoyable game with an infinite amount of gameplay stored in it.

"Initive mulation of 's Raor-Elusive Jet HTAWK REVIEW The Rockeyes are loaded and then targets straight. TM FUHTER 2.0 KOCKEYE IT ACCEL CHENNARS FLANT STEALTH HOW IT WORKS Stealth is the culmination of many man-years of development and millions of dollars of military funding. The F117-A is coated in special Radar Absorbment Material, or RAM, which literally soaks up radar waves like a sponge dramatically reducing the plane's signature and making it much harder to spot. The radically new shape of the F117-A, with its smooth curves and lack of weapons pylons (all armaments are stored inside the craft) assists in cutting further the plane's signature on radar. Due to these breakthroughs, it is said that what would normally be a sitting duck due to its slow speed and hopeless manouver ability, shows up on enemy screens as an object not much bigger than a bird and it is because of this that the F117-A was so successful in the Gulf War. A VIEW TO A KILL As is the norm in today's flight sims, F117-A Stealth Fighter v2.0 allows the player to select a number of outside-the-cockpit views. The regulars, such as chase plane and enemy-to-plane views, are spectacular enough, but the most amazing sight has to be that of a missile streaking through the skies on its way to destroy its intended enemy target. -21 FISHED "


"REVIEW Esfahan STEALTH FIGHTER 20 FIGHTER 20 PM Ya Ahvaz GULF WAR, ANYONE? Probably the most controversial aspect of F117-A Stealth Fighter v2.0 is the inclusion of the Operation Desert Storm scenario. The F117-A was perhaps the most successful aircraft throughout the whole conflict in terms of enemy \"kills\" almost onehundred percent success rate and no Stealth losses made it the hero of the conflict. It is reported that for each mission undertaken by a Stealth Fighter, to complete the objective using conventional craft would have taken around thirty planes, including escorts, bombers and supply ships a logistical nightmare made easy with the use of hi-tech.

Take one of the best fighter sims on the market, tweak it up, add extra scenarios, improve the graphics and sound and you have F117-A Stealth Fighter 2.0. In terms of speed, I have to say the game doesn't match the incredible Jetfighter II (turn off the fancy graphics and the game turbo charges for smoother flight) but it certainly has the edge in atmos phere. Just like the original, you really feel you're up there in this top secret crateful of tricks and the desire to complete your mission (of which there are squillions) and return safely to base makes the game one of the most compulsive around. The programmers have obviously put a lot of care and thought in which means the game is so realistic it plays like a dream! Buy Stealth Fighter 2.0 and lose a few nights' sleep flying with the best. Don't buy it and you'll lose a few nights' sleep anyway as you worry about all the fun you're missing... TIM PRIZES AND PROMOTIONS If a mission has been executed well enough, the Stealth pilot could be in the lucky position of receiving a promotion or, if he's done really well, a medal. The player begins the game at the rank of 2nd Lieutenant with the opportunity of becoming an allpowerful but non-flying Brigadier General. Decorations are given for a number of reasons: fly a particularly successful mission and the Air Medal may be awarded, whilst those injured in battle can expect to receive a Purple Heart.

"REVIEW AMIGA BY US GOLD .99 ears ago, the vicious scourge known as the Mad Gear gang moved into Metro City and have been there ever since, bribing mayors, running various scams and causing general havoc and mayhem throughout the Metropolis. The citizens were crying out for a saviour and in Haggar, ex-champion street fighter and new boss of Metro City, they found him. A no-nonsense guy, Haggar closed down the Mad Gear businesses exiling the villains to the Under ground. The Mad Gear wanted revenge, and there was only one sure way The telephone rang in Haggar's office. \"We wanna do a deal.\" explained the voice on the other end. \"One which would be. uh, beneficial to both parties. You give us the go ahead to restart our let's call 'em interests, and you receive the monthly figure we of fered before plus, say, an extra fifty percent...\" Haggar, incensed, was about to slam down the receiver when the chilling line was spoken: \"And you get your daughter back.\" \"You'll not get away with this!\" stormed the Mayor. A couple of calls later and Cody and Guy, the toughest fighters in the city, were given their orders: go out there, close down the Mad Gear gang for good and rescue Jessica. There was no need to say it a second time sting the big bosd's car for barn is a ho Final Fight was the best thing to happen to arcades for a long, long time-combining multi-player action with extreme violence to create a superb scrolling beat 'em up. After the stunning Famicom conversion, Amiga owners were expecting big things for their interpretation of the game and, although there are a few bits gone missing during the crossover from coin-op to computer, the overall impression is a job well done by US Gold and programmers Creative Materials. The coin-op's high definition graphics have been transported excellently to the Amiga, giving the game huge, colourful battlers and only a slight drop in speed when a bundle of them are on-screen at any one time. Sound effects are similarly impressive, especially the noise of the underground train as it rattles into the station which is so realistic you'd believe you were standing in King's Cross! For some reason though, the in-game music has been left out of the finished version, which is a shame as it would have added so much to the atmosphere. On coming to play the game, it's noticeable than some of the moves have been omitted from Amiga Final Fight the hold for one but to compensate for that there's the inclusion of simultaneous twoplayer action, something which the wondrous Famicom couldn't handle. Overall, Final Fight could be better but it's very good as it is! PAUL RAND GET ALL TOOLED UP Not only can Guy, Cody and Haggar punch and kick, they can also do a few nifty things with the weapons lying scattered throughout Metro City. Whilst the knife is good for throwing and close-range siashing at enemies, the more useful object is the sixfoot length of lead piping which the lads can pick up and swing at the unfortunate Mad Gear boys!

"IREVIEW ! UPDATE With all sorts of conversions under way. Final Fight should be on a machine near you pretty darned soon. BONUS BATTLING After completing a level, the player is treated to one of two bonus games. The first has the Final Fighters smashing up a flash car belonging to a member of the Mad Gear gang using either fists, feet or a handy piece of lead piping, whilst the other game involves walking through a glass factory and smashing up the panes. But watch out hitting the glass in the wrong place causes it to spin round and smack straight into your man! Beating of a Samurai in a boxing ringa Final Fight is probably the most eagerly awaited arcade license this year. The fact that it features almost every level and feature of the original arcade game is a real boon. There are a few noteable differences, such as the lack of destructible objects and a couple of missing moves. The overall effect is slower and less frantic than the arcade version, but it plays smoothly enough. The game itself is a fairly enjoyable romp. featuring much Dendt hang upl lle have a little death and destruction as well as a fair old bit of harmless violence. All in all it's a fairly decent conversion of a Business proposition for you phenomenal coin-op. Probably a bit too easy for older players though.

"frumefraveler HOLOGRAD _GR AM SEGA ega's latest machine is \"revolutionary\" thanks to the fact that it's the World's first \"holographic\" coin-op. Well, Sega call it holographic. In fact, no holograms are involved at all the whole thing is an illusion. Images of \"live action actors\" are projected onto a parabolic mirror to give the impression that they're actually 3-dimen sional and are walking around inside the glass dome sunk into the front of the machine. Still, effect is quite neat even though everything is displayed on a black background, the images themselves are quite small and there are horrible distortions if you walk around the machine. But even though the concept is new, the actual gameplay style is as old as the hills. It's very much in the vein of the early 1980's laserdisk coin-ops, like Dragon's Lair and Astron Belt. The player \"takes control of a time travelling cowboy called Marshall Gram, who must travel the chrono-ways of the past, present and future and defeat a bad guy called Vulcor and save Princess Kyila. This involves battling through a variety of situations by using the joystick and fire button in the right place at the right time. It's very simple and there's even a learning mode to help complete novices get to grips with the action! Holograms ahoy! A peek inside Sega's Time Traveler cabinet HOLO-CONTROL The action is presented as a series of sequences and problems which the player must guide the hero through by moving the joy. stick left, right, up or down or by pressing the fire button at the correct time during the sequence. For example, the opening scene sees a cowboy pop up on the hero's left. Press the joystick towards him and fire and the hero will shoot the baddie dead. Get it wrong and the hero gets shot As the hero progresses through the game, the sequences get more and more complicated (left, right, up, up, down, left and shoot, etc), but the basic concept remains the same. "


"HOLO-ACTION To complete the game, the player has to successfully negotiate his way through a variety of different time zones. There are about 20 of these, ranging from the 18th to the 26th Century, and some are connected to others. What the player must do is pick and complete one time zone at a time and make a route through the time network and reach the baddie on the final 26th century level. HOLO-HAM Whether it's deliberate or not, the actors who play the roles in the coin-op are about as convincing as planks of wood. Terrible acting is in evidence as the hero battles through different time eras and is accosted by a veritable army of hams ranging from unconvincing cowboys to unrealistic hooligans from the edge of time. It's real infant school nativity play stuff! Full marks to Sega for coming up with new technology and an original concept, but sadly I don't think it's going to set the gaming arcade world alight. The problem is that although Time Travel ler is very impressive to look at it certainly pulled crowds of onlookers at the two Southend arcades where I tested the game to play, it's a real bore. It's just like the old laserdisk arcade machines of ten years back, only Time Traveller lacks their fantastic animation and hilarious, wacky cartoon humour. Instead, it's very poor, featuring unconvincing \"live action\" acting and uninspiring situations. The gameplay is very limited and you've got no \"real\" control over the character. He wanders around under his own steam and you simply have to push the joystick in the right direction at the correct points during the action. This may be OK for lazy players who want everything taken care for them, but as an active player I want more than just a very simple and at .00 a go expensive reflex test. Time Traveller only really works as a novelty arcade attraction that makes non-playing punters gasp and stare. As a game to play it's simply too dull, too limited and too predictable to be worth more than a couple of goes.

"Ninja. The ancient Japanese school of stealth, assassina. I tion and groovy black outfits. Ninja have long held a fascination for the games playing public and appear in one form or another, in almost every beat em up since the genre began. System 3 have finally announced an Amiga version of their 64 classic. The game is an isometric 3D arcade adventure, featuring a plethora of puzzles, problems and whirling Ninja death squads. There are several levels to negotiate, with each level having one of the elements as a theme. Fire, air and water are predictable enough, but the final showdown takes place in an area called the Void. This looks suspiciously like space, although quite what a Ninja warrior is doing in the blackness of space, is a bit of a mystery. The puzzle element is strong, with your Ninja having to collect materials and tools in order to progress. Weapons, free lives and bonuses are scattered throughout the terrain, so there's certainly lots to see and do. We wait with bated breath. VERSION DATE AMIGA TBA 807069 All those nice Italians, like the ones in the Cornetto and Ragu adverts, will be horrified to discover that a small per centage of the Italian community have been a bit naughty. The range of their mischievous antics extends to extortion, drug running and callous murder. These are almost certainly pranks which merit a severe spanking and the immediate withdrawl of pocket money. Mario Puzo's epic account of these cheeky japes has now been transformed into an arcade style game from US Gold. The game takes the form of a horizontally scrolling platform shoot em up and apparently features some rather extraordinary graphics. In style, the game will be some what reminiscent of Rolling Thunder and will contain nine levels of blasting action. Extensive use of sampled sound effects should help the game's atmosphere and a hint of strategy will creep into the proceedings. Lots of hidden features and bonuses are there for you to discover and an icon driven panel smooths out the more complex aspects of gameplay. The game has scenes from all three Godfather films and there are tons of greasy dangerous looking Italians to blow away.

"FLAG GREMLIN Flag. The one word that strikes fear into the hearts of the people of Deskworld. Deskworld was created by a Wizard known as Hearn the Terrible. A man of great power and infinite malice, he takes great joy in organising a battle between the two villages of Deskworld. Every twenty years, they must fight for possession of the other village's flag. The game itself is a kind of strategic RPG, but with the kind of gameplay you have come to associate with the likes of Populous and Sim City. Featuring some truly outstanding graphics and lots of digitised characters, Flag has a few novel features of its own. Players must master the use of magic, fighting and siege tactics to win the flag, but remember, Hearn the Terrible is always watching...
