The computer has been accused of many evils in the past-breaking up marriages and ruining children's minds, to mention just two. But, up to now that is, never of telling bad jokes. Computerworld Software had the unusual idea of collecting vast numbers of short jokes and oneliners and incorporating them into a computer program The World's First Computer Joke Book was born. The program contains over 500 jokes which the author has collected from several exhausting sessions with joke-telling school kids. The program works in four different modes. The first mode just runs through all 500 jokes in sequence. The second throws up jokes in a random order and the third does the same but gives you a chance to guess the punchline. The final mode lets you enter the number of the joke you want to read. Another feature of this option is that it throws up jokes hidden in the program that are, shall we say, a little fruity! The game runs on the 48k Spectrum and costs .95 on cassette or .95 on microdrive. We'd be interested to hear from you if you have any computer jokes or joke programs.

"BUG HUNTER'S GUIDE TO The Amstrad CPC 464 was launched in April of this year, at a time when most of us had been waiting around three months for our QLs. If the Amstrad was good enough and actually appeared on time then it was clear that people would cancel their QL orders and opt for the Amstrad. And this is what has been happening. THE MACHINE ITSELF The CPC 464 is a 64k micro with a choice of 27 colours. It has a proper keyboard, similar to that of the BBC, but feels of better quality. There's a separate numeric keypad to make the typing of numbers easier and also a separate ENTER key on the numeric pad. Apart from the early PETs, this is the first micro to have a built-in cassette recorder. The whole machine is about an inch deeper than a Spectrum and two and a half times as long. This includes the keyboard and cassette recorder. Despite being told by Amstrad that there would be only two versions of the computer, there are actually three. The most expensive is a CPC 464 complete with colour monitor, at . Alternatively, you can buy the same computer with a green screen monitor for just . The problem with the green version is that you can't, we were told, upgrade to a colour monitor at a later date. However, Amstrad have introduced the MPI modulator/power supply which will allow you to connect the computer to a normal colour TV. This will cost you .95. AMSTRAD CPC464 ADD ONS A disc drive for the system is due out soon. For  you get a 3 inch disk drive and interface running CP/M. You also get DR Logo and the whole price includes VAT. A second drive will cost just . A printer is available at . It's a modified version of the Seikosha 500 and will print screen dumps from the Amstrad. You can use a normal Atari type joystick in the machine, but it will only take one. If you want the other, then you have to buy the official Amstrad one which daisy-chains onto another. Recommended price for an Amstrad joystick is .95 but most shops are selling them for around . SOUND The machine has the chip as the BBC Micro. It produces three voices through an internal speaker. The TV sound is not used. Unlike the Beeb, though, there's actually a volume control on the side of the machine. If you want a richer sound than the internal speaker produces, you can connect the micro to a hi fi system through a connection on the back of the machine. Amstrad showed me a demo of a computer connected to a stereo system (Amstrad of course!) and the sound was really good. The different sound channels of the machine are sent to different parts of the stereo Spectrum, which can produce some amazing effects. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GAMES? Many software houses are currently working on software for the Amstrad. Romik have launched a fairly average batch of unexciting games. Amstrad has set up its own software division called Amsoft which has converted a lot of popular games to the new micro. There are versions of quite a few Spectrum classics including games from Quicksilva and Sinclair GRAPHICS screen at a time depending on The CPC 464 has three screen whether you're in mode two, one or modes. When you turn it on, it is set zero respectively. to mode one. This gives you 40 Drawing uses the Spectrum-like characters on each of 25 screen lines. plot and draw commands. Plot will Mode zero gives you 20 characters plot a single point on the screen while mode two gives a full 80 while draw will construct a line from column display. This is useful for that point to another. word processing, but probably won't The screen resolution in mode zero be readable on a normal colour TV. It is 200 x 160 pixels. In mode one this is works fine on the monitor, though. 200 x 320, while in hi res mode two The machine has 27 possible colours you have 200 x 640 pixels to play with, and you can have two, four or 16 on but at the expense of colours. LOCOMOTIVE BASIC The Amstrad micro runs Locomotive Basic which leaves about 42k of the machine's RAM available for your program All graphics and sound commands are included. There are no long lists of POKEs to type in. There is a large number of non-standard commands which may come in useful in some applications. You can, for example, convert strings from upper to lower case and vice-versa. One of the most useful and unique functions in Amstrad Basic is the ability to handle interrupts from Basic. Interrupts are used by machine code programmers to make the CPU chip stop what it's doing every so often and do something else. For example, interrupts are used so that whatever the chip is doing, it will regularly check whether any keys are being pressed on the keyboard You can use interrupts from Basic with the EVERY command. For example EVERY 100, GOSUB 1000 will call the subroutine at line 1000 every two seconds, irrespective of what may be happening at the time. The manual which comes free with the machine is one of the best I've seen. There's a simple beginners' section and then a more detailed explanation of all the keywords. An advanced version of the user guide is available from Amsoft at .95. "

And if you can push the pause button on your cassette player, you'll be able to get everything running together it's as simple as that. The soundtrack begins and so does a whole new life. What? Well, let me explain a little more. In Mel's vision of the future, video DEVS EX MACHINA audio eus Ex Machina is a labour of love. Nine months in the making at Automata's Portsmouth base, the game is the most original concept since the Spectrum was a gleam in Clive Sinclair's eye. It is the first computer game to have a completely synchronised music soundtrack which features top names like Ian Dury, ex-Doctor Who Jon Pertwee, comedian Frankie Howerd and peace campaigner E.P. Thompson The man behind the concept is Mel Croucher, ex-architect, science fiction author, radio producer and musician. Together with Christian Penfold the man better known for dressing up in a pink suit Mel runs Automata, home of the PiMan. Mel wrote the \"screenplay\" for the game, performed and recorded all the music on the soundtrack and is now sitting back anxiously awaiting your reaction to his creation. \"I was really disappointed with the way home computers were being used,\" he told C&VG. \"I wanted to show people just what could be done with the Spectrum and prove that computer games could be constructive and not just destructive. Automata are well known for their policy of producing non-violent games. And Mel's feelings on the subject are echoed in the lyrics of one of the Machina songs, spoken by Ian Dury. \"Killing is wrong, even pretend killing on little screens. And people that sell violent games to children should be put away somewhere safe, 'till they get well again.\" Whatever your views on computer games and violence you'll have to agree that Deus Ex Machina is unique and maybe a forerunner of games to come. Let's have a brief run through of the game. Before you start playing, you have to listen to a bit of the soundtrack Two storyboards from the planning stage of Deus Ex Machina.

"MSX GAMES PROGRAMS EDITOR'S COMMENT C&VG is constantly looking for good games programs to publish in our magazine. We are especially interested in MSX software as we expect many of our readers will be MSX owners next year. If you have written a good game between 1 and 5k, do send it to us with the software form provided in the main section of C&VG. Remember, we do pay for every program published. COMPETITION RULE We have got in touch with several companies and have put together several great prizes. Each entry must be written on the cut-out coupon provided, with the competition name clearly written on the envelope. Please send each entry separately as this will help us a great deal in sorting them out. All competitions close on 25th November and the prizes will be sent out between late November and early December but please don't 'phone us. The editor's decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into. Having had a detailed look at every aspect of the MSX standard its hardware, the MSX Basic and the software now produced it is about time to set the record straight. During the past few months, it seems the MSX standard has been unfairly criticised by the technical press for using the now ageing 280 microprocessor and thus freezing the technology. Some say that because of the choice of the chips inside the MSX machines, it is impossible to write good games on them. It seems that these people were unable to review the machines or just had a few days to have a look at one. The lack of availability of MSX machines to review was entirely due to the MSX working group's policy of sending out every single preproduction MSX computer they could ship from Japan to software houses in the UK so they can produce a large amount of MSX software in time for the launch. The policy was applied in Japan last year and the result was that there were plenty of games for MSX as soon as they were launched, thus avoiding the customary six month no-software period. Having got in touch with a number of software houses in the UK recently, C&VG knows for a fact that there will be a temendous amount of MSX software released prior to Christmas. There seems to be a fallacy that, because of the choice of the chips for MSX, it is not possible to produce fast graphics games on them. This couldn't be more wrong. MSX is the only computer which can produce graphics that match those in the coin-operated arcade machines. Just look at one of Konami's games on a demo and see for yourself. The graphics and the background music in their games are truly amazing. Another common criticism against MSX is that the standard freezes technology, thus creating a lull. It seems that many technocrats seem to want 32-bit super computers at a price of home computers, but look at the mess Sinclair is in with the QL. Delayed and bug-ridden, it is so unorthodox that most people are having to struggle to produce anything for the QL On the other hand, the MSX is so standard and the 280 chip familiar with many people that producing software and peripherals is extremely easy. The result is that now, in Japan, there are tons of exotic add-ons like synthesisers, video superimposition units, laserdisc adapters, computer controlled hi-fis, apart from the usual printers, joysticks and ROM-based software. MSX-DOS and the disc drives will be launched some time early next year. You can expect to see a lot of exciting products for MSX and, whoever the manufacturer of your MSX machine is, you can still use any MSX peripheral from any company. As for reliability and dealer back-up, the Japanese always excel themselves. If you are in any doubt about MSX, go to your local dealer and have a go. It's the best way to find out what MSX is really like. 47 "


"MSX HISTORY OF MSX THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME... No, MSX isn't a new kind of stunt cycle —it's a range of new computers from Japan, manufactured by big names like Sony, Mitsubishi and Canon.

"MSX MSX BASIC REVIEWED SETTING A STANDARD MSX has a very sophisticated sound generator chip. This chip will allow you to produce wonderful sound effects in three channels. The MSX computer does not have a builtin speaker, and therefore uses the TV speaker, but it can be connected to a hi-fi amplifier if desired. Apart from sound effects, MSX can play music using a special sublanguage called the Music Macro Language. It's used in a similar way to the Graphic Macro Language. As long as you can read sheet music, you can program any tune since all keys on the piano are represented.

"MSX GAMES LISTING MAJOR TOM \"Here am I floating in a tin can, far above the world. Planet Earth is blue and there is nothing I can do!\" Space Oddity by David Bowie Well, it turns out that the Moon is yellow and Major Tom is trying to land his lunar module on the moon base alpha. This is a relatively simple version of a lunar lander program specially written for MSX Basic. Because of the MSX machines's ability to use good graphics and sprites from Basic, the listing is only 100 lines long. That's including the numerous REM statements which explain each section of the program. The game has two levels and your score depends on how much fuel you have left when you land. To move the lunar lander, use A. key to fire the vertical thruster and < and > keys for the horizontal thrusters. There is a speed and fuel indicator which shows your status and your score is displayed when you land. This short program was written in one day. MSX Basic is very easy to program and I recommend anyone who has typed in this program to improve it and add many levels to it. 10 REN MAJ.

What about your own? A role-playing game is a sophisticated form of make believe in which each player creates a \"game persona\", or set of characteristics, and verbally acts out the role of that person in a specially designed gameOF THE world controlled by a referee. Game personas are usually referred to as player characters, to distinguish them from the non playercharacters operated by the referee. During a game, players will interact with other players to direct their characters as they see fit, playing the roles ordained for their characters, much as actors in a play. This is how the games gained their roleplaying\" nickname. In the short term, players will cooperate in pursuit of some common objective, such as the accumulation of wealth and power for their characters, in a risk-filled adventure run by the referee.

"the adventure At last, all can be revealed! For several months now we've been sitting on a story which our ace Adventurer, Keith Campbell, has been itching to tell you. It concerns The Stranglers' keyboard player, Dave Greenfield, and a brand new Adventure game... GET AN EARFUL OF THIS! Adventure games are increasingly becoming linked with books and the affinity is easy to see, since both contain a blend of words, plot, excitement and humour. Computer games in general are also moving closer to the world of pop music. For some time there have been computer games charts -just like the pop top 20 charts. Earlier this year, C&VG started printing the only authoritative games chart in the country, by commissioning NOP, jointly with the Daily Mirror. But it is easier to see this link in the Dave Greenfield, centre, the Strangler who loves adventures, wh area of the current arcade-game scene. Adventures and pop-music?? actually play Adventure games?\" I their intention to complete the game Some time ago Shakin' Stevens asked. \"Nothing else,\" replied Dave, at the next sitting!

This idea has He was very definite about that and and Ship of Doom, however, would now been taken a step further with proudly showed me his collection of have been redundant, as they had the release of a new album by The games software.

"AURAL QUEST The Strangler's new album, Aural Sculpture, features a large statue of an ear which is to be displayed on stage when the band goes on tour. Aural Quest is the Adventure game that is to be found on the cassette version of the album. Not being a music critic, I will not dwell on the album, save to say that I found it enjoyable listening. The game, however, is for the 48k Spectrum and written using The Quill system. In Aural Quest, you play the part of The Stranglers' tour manager, your task being to visit various cities around the world where the Stranglers have played and collect the promoters' payments. These you must return to their accountant but, in addition, you must find the parts of the giant ear and bring them back to London to make up the whole statue. This is a novel approach, for it involves a double search and links in with some real events from Stranglers'tours. Remember they got jailed in France? You will have to bail them out! Other places you will visit are New York, watch out for the muggers in Central Park, Tokyo and its student riots, Stockholm and Brisbane. But before you can start all this, you have a nasty problem from which to extricate yourself back home. There you are, up the top of a ladder, 5, with Jean-Jaques Burnel, Hugh Cornwell and Jet Black. decorating your flat, a dripping paint brush in your hand and the phone rings.

"Home computers. The report you've been waiting for: simple, factual, honest,comprehensive and 100% biased. "


"th CHIP: micro. A very complex electrical circuit that has been miniaturisedin silicon. Unlike otherhome computer companies, Commodore manufacture their own chips, so first class quality can be maintained. Jus ho Yo LL you need to know about computers can be summed up in one word: Commodore. Well, we did tell you this would be biased). We make everything you'll ever need to get the most out of home computing: all the hardware and all the software. (And if you don't understand what that means, simply look under \"H\"). That's what these three pages are all about: explaining what computers are (without the scientific jargon), how they work (without any technical mumbo-jumbo), and how you can get more enjoyment out of them (without much difficulty). It has an extensive 64K memory, with an exceptionally large 60K available for use. The plus/4 comes equipped with the Commodore BASIC 3.5 with over 75 programming commands. Other features include comprehensive graphics, 121 colours and sound facilities. ISK drive. A program storage system, like cassettes, but much faster. You can find the program you're 150 looking for in seconds instead of minutes. Disks, which can be used again and again for recording or re-recording programs, are placed in the disk drive which then transfers the information or instructions to the CPU. CO BA BJ BASIC. Most home computers speak the same language. It's called BASIC. This is a friendly way of saying \"Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code! There are different kinds of BASIC and, like languages, some are a little easier to understand than others. Like, for instance, BASIC 3.5 in the Commodore plus/4 and Commodore 16 computers. BOOKS you can read: \"Teach Yourself Computer Programming With The Commodore 64\" and \"Programmers Reference Guide! EDUCATION software from _ Commodore. We are continually working with educationalists, improving our range of programs for the pre-schoolto \"O\"level age groups and beyond. Many claim computers are an essential educational aid. We tend to agree! Our \"Get Ready to Read\" series, with a lovable character called B.J. The Bear, is recognised as an excellent example C ORTEK and the Microchips is a unique programming course, for children of all ages, that links learning exercises with a space adventure story. GRAPHICS. The pictures and diagrams on a monitor or TV screen, either high or low resolution. All Commodore home computers have 66 graphic symbols to create low resolution pictures and diagrams, or high resolution modes that allow you to specify each pixel (or dot) on the screen. There can be upto 64,000 of these). GAMES: Commodore produce them all, from shoot'em up games, to games of adventure and complex strategy. CASSETTE. Just as you keep your _favourite TV programmes on video cassette, and your favourite music on audio cassette, you can keep your favourite computer programson cassette too. You can buy pre-recorded programs in a shop, or you can write them yourself. Cassettes are just one form of program storage and playback see also Cartridges and Disk Drive. The Commodore 1530 and 1531 cassette units have been specifically designed to get the very best out of our computers, and provide consistently reliable results. of how it is possible to develop reading and writing skills in pre-school children. ELEPHANT: wellknown symbol of the Commodore 64's enormous 64K memory. And don't you forget it! ELP! On the Commodore plus/4 computers there is a very special feature: a HELPkey. It does exactly what it says: it helps you to debug (which is a flash way of saying, \"identify and correct errors\") when you're programming. It high lights errors right down to individual instructions. HARDWARE The computer itself-you can touch it. Whereas software's a program you can only see or hear(on the monitor) when it's running in the computer. CARTRIDGES. These are programs that plug directly into the back of the computer itself. CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. This is the computer's \"brain and basically it's what does all the hard work. OUR is for Commodore plus/4, _ our very latest home computer with four, very popular built-in programs: wordprocessing, spread-sheet (financial planning) database (filing), and graphics. "


"tory, over again. It stores data and instructions during the execution of a computer program. These are lost when you switch the machine off-unless, of course you store them on cassette or disk mes ing urs NTEGRAL software is software _ that's actually built into the computer, as on the Commodore plus/4, the very latest in home computing INTRODUCTION to BASIC. Just as you don't need to understand how a car works to be able to drive it, you don't have to understand how a computer works to be able to use one. But you will definitely get more enjoyment out of it if you do have a basic knowledge of programming. Which is why \"Introduction to BASIC\" has become the most popular software tutorial. It comprises 2 cassettes and an easy-to-follow, step-by-step booklet. INPUT/output: the part of the computer that allows data to be transferred between its own internal memory (the RAM memory) and an external device (like a cassette unit, disk drive or printer). ONITOR:thisisthe screen on which you can see what you've typed into the computer, and also what the computer is saying back to you You can use an ordinary TV screen, but more preferable is a colour video monitor, like the Commodore 1701. This is a special device that produces much higher resolution than a TV, and so offers superb reproduction and clarity. On top of which it allows the rest of the family to stay tuned-in to their favourite TV programme while you're tuned-in to your favourite computer program. MODEMS allow computers to connect via a telephone line to other computer systems. Commodore 64 modem owners can communicate with other owners, join systems like Prestel Micronet and an exciting new system called Compunet, where quality software is available cheaply or even free. N UMBER ONE. In the whole wide world, Commodore is No. 1 in microcomputers, and the Commodore 64's the No. 1 best seller. is a Tse, hat ory ams oh. hic ion OYSTICK and paddles. _ As well as improving speed and accuracy, these make games more real by putting the control of whatever it is on the screen directly into your hands. En KILOBYTE is 1,024 bytes. So \"K\" stands for a unit of 1,024 or 210 A 64K byte memory unit contains 64 x 210 or 65,536 bytes of memory. And if you don't understand all that, don't worry. All that's important is knowing you can run more complex programs through a computer with a large memory, than one with a small memory. RIGIN of the computer. In the 19th Century an Englishman, Charles Babbage, invented the first true computer. But his \"Analytical Engine was so ahead of its time, it turned out to be impossible to build! The modern computer first appeared around the time of World War II. Britain's \"Colossus\" was vast, consumed vast amounts of electricity, required its own air-conditioned room, was unreliable and difficult to operate. It had its limitations. Then came the amazing transistor... integrated circuits...and microcomputer. The first desk top microcomputer in the world was the Commodore PET (a friendly name for Personal Electronic Transactor), in 1977. In effect Commodore had taken hitherto huge, mysterious machines accessable only to eggheads, reduced the size and price, and put them into the hands of ordinary mortals in ordinary offices. OO ANGUAGE. This is a system of __coding that can be under stood by a computer. It allows you to \"speak\" to the computer, and for the computer to \"speak\" to you. Most home computers speak BASIC, but there are also other languages available for Commodore computers K9 that have been designed 52 for specific uses. For example, LOGOS and PILOT in education. MEMORY. There are two basic types of memory: ROM and RAM. Read Only Memory (ROM) is the computer's permanent built-in memory which tells the computer what to do. It doesn't disappear when the computer's switched off. Random Access Memory (RAM), however, HELLO! IS THAT is fortemporary (THE COMMODORE COMPUTER storage. ACROSS THE ROAD? It's the part of the computer's 21. memory that's free 3 for you to use. It can be erased and used over and ERIPHERALS. These are outsid _ the main body of the computer, but are connected to it. They perform a definite function, which is usually input or output. PRINTER: One of the ways a computer can \"speak\" to us. It means you can actually keep, on paper, the fruits of all your labour. $ you VERO "

The MPS802 dot matrix friction feed printer has a print speed of 60characters per second The MCS801 dot matrix colour printer has 7 colours and prints 38 characters per second. The DPS1101 daisy wheelprinter (called that because, surprise, surprise, the print wheel looks a bit like a daisy), produces superb quality print on all letters, reports and documents the kind of quality one desperately requires on a letter to the bank manager). There's a range of alternative type faces available on additional print wheels. Speed: 18 characters per second. And the 1520 printer plotter, (illustrated).

"ODYSSEY OF HOPE REVIEWS \"competent\", its saving grace being the spectacular speed of its graphics. Odyssey of Hope is from Martech for 48k Spectrum Keith Campbell DEVIL'S ISLAND I hoped Martech's new Adventure would come up to a high standard because I had criticised their last offering on a false premise. I had claimed the instructions were inaccurate when, in fact, I had read them incorrectly. For Odyssey of Hope, Martech has turned from Commodore to Spectrum and they sent me the game with a letter expressing their hope that I did not find the print on the inlay too small. All too often the inlay on a standard cassette has almost microscopic printing to squeeze it all inhave you noticed? Anywayno grounds for complaint this time the inlay was clear, precise and uncluttered. Additional instructions were supplied on one side of the tape itself to be loaded only if required. On to the game proper, and here we come to the nitty gritty. What's in the pudding, I wondered? Odyssey of Hope sets the player the task of returning Hope to the top of Mount Olympus.

The game has graphics at every location and I have never seen such fast displaying graphics before on the Spectrum. There is an unusual text-screen format, whereby the visible objects are always displayed and updated just Devil's Island is one of the new breed of Spectrum Adventures written with the aid of The Quill. It comes from Gilsoft and was designed by Colin Smith Using The Quill, an Adventure is not written directly as program code, so the author needs no knowledge of programming. In theory this means that anyone with imagination should be able to design a challenging Adventure, without the need to learn programming skills. In practice, things don't seem to be working out this way perhaps because imagination is, in any case, a prerequisite for a programmer. To start with, I found it an Adventure in itself just to load the game it took me seven attempts to get the volume set \"You are dead\" locations, at which, correctly.

Pity about the game! The Waster is a new Adventure from Harddata who package it with a poor quality inlay. I hope this will be reflected in the price. The game puts you in the role of a CIA agent, code-named Waster. You are the CIA's top assassin and, because of this dubious honour, you are about to be sent on a mission to Africa to kill a right wing dictator. The night before setting out on this mission, you dream about your wife, the Vietnam War and many other things that CIA agents supposedly dream about! In fact, the first part of the Adventure is to escape from your nightmares so that you can get to Africa to kill Pasoa, the dictator. The second part takes place in his palace where you must kill him. The game is very slow to respond and even more annoying is the fact that it has a minute vocabulary and that the locations are random. The vocabulgry consists of ten singleletter commands which is an indication that the game lacks depth and imagination. After all, how can you try 122 "

"THE FLYING VIKING The Saga of Erik the Viking is the title of a book by former Monty Python Flying Circus star, Terry Jones, The tales, written for his young son, tell of the brave deeds of Erik, a Viking warrior who sets sail on a quest for adventure. He and his crew find plenty of that! They meet the Enchantress of the Fjord, dis cover a talking valley and have many other exciting experiences. Erik is now the star of his own computer adventure. Keith Campbell, C&VG's very own Adventurer, went to meet Terry Jones as the ex-Pythoneer saw the computerised version of his hero for the first time. ete Austin, from Level 9 Computing, is the man who turned Erik the Viking into a computer adventure. In order to design and write Erik the Viking, Pete Austin spent a considerable time in York, carrying out research in that city. \"We have been pretty thorough,\" he said, \"and you may not realise it, but all the pictures and text references in the game are really quite authentic.\" Knowing that, it's the sort of game that awakens an interest that demands further reading on the subject. This Adventure game will not only entertain, and bring to life Erik and his band, but educate as well.

To really stretch it, you need more interesting software programs. For example, record keeping, interactive education, stimulating adventure games or word processing.

"COSMIC DIGGER RUNS ON A TEXAS WITH EXTENDED BASIC BY CHRISTOPHER HUSAIN Now here's a great game for your Texas. It's the best version of Manic . . . er ... the best climbing game I've ever seen on the machine! You have to guide our hero round the rooms, collecting the keys so that he can go through the door to the next chamber. But watch out for the aliens which sweep from side to side. Use the S and D keys to move left and right. To jump, press the J key. But watch out when you jump, as you won't always reach the same height. : CALL CLEAR :: CALL SCREEN(5):: CALL MAGNIFY (3) 2 DISPLAY AT (12.1): \"DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS?\" :: ACCEPT AT (12.26):A$ :: IF SEG9 (A$,1,1)=\"Y\" THEN 142 3 CALL CLEAR :: CALL COLOR (3,2,1.4, 2.1) 4 CALL CHAR (96,\"030702030303070FODODOE0E0703030380C0B0C0800080COCOCOCOC080000080 5 CALL CHAR(100.\"030702030303070F0F1F1F030706060780008000800080COCOE06080COCOCOE 6 CALL CHAR(104.\"030702030303070F OF 1F1B070FOCOCOESOC0800080008OCOCOEOEOCOE060607 7 CALL CHAR (108. \"01030103010001030303030301000001C0E040COCOCOEOFOBOBO7070EOCOCOC B CALL CHAR (112.\"01030103010001030307060103030307COE040COCOCOEOFOFOF8F8C0E06060E 9 CALL CHAR(116.\"0103010301000103030707030706060ECOE040COCOCOEOF OF0F8D8E0F030307 O\") 10 CALL CHAR (132.\"030303031F1F030303030303030F7FFFCOCOCOCOF8F8COCOCOCOCOCOCOFOFE FF\") 11 SCR=1 :: LV=3 :: SC=O :: KY=0 :: S=0 12 ON SCR GOSUB 32, 48, 71,67.100 13 RC=96 :: CALL SPRITE(,96,10,96, 128) 14 IF LV: 0 THEN 125 15 DISPLAY AT (2,5) SIZE (7): SC :: DISPLAY AT (2, 12) SIZE(3): LV 16 CALL PATTERN (.RC):: CALL JOYST (1,A.X):: CALL MOTION (,0, A) 17 CALL POSITION(,R.C) :: CALL GCHAR (R/8+3.C/8+1.G) :: IF G 32 THEN VM=1 : GOTO. 26 ELSE IF G=120 THEN 133 18 IF G-123 THEN CALL HCHAR (R/8+3.0/8+1,120) :: GOSUB 123 0 19 IF 6*124 THEN CALL HCHAR (R/B+3,C/841.120) :: GOSUB 124 20 IF X<> THEN 25 21 CALL COINC (ALL.H):: IF H THEN 133 22 RC=RC+A :: IF RC>104 AND A=4 THEN RC=96 ELSE IF RC<108 AND A=-4 THEN RC=116 23 IF KY>=3 THEN 114 24 GOTO 16 158 Illustration: Dorian Cross "

MODEM The first time you'll notice the speed of the new system, says Solo Software, is when you have to load Basic after switching on the =(Protek computer. Whereas this normally took around three minutes with 1200 MODEM cassettes, it now takes just four seconds. This must be almost worth the  price tag in itself but when you read that it operates from normal Sharp Basic with no special commands to learn then you'll probably have already started writing out the cheque. If you'd rather get more details before committing yourself, though, then Solo are on 0905 58351. MODEMS AGAIN The much talked about modem from Protek has finally been launched. It's an acoustic coupler which means that, instead of wiring it directly to your phone, you just plug the handset into the two rubber cups on the modem itself. This works fine for standard phones but won't fit if you have one of those posh trimphones. The modem works at 1200/1200 baud half duplex and 1200/75 baud through the phone network. The The new 1200 modem from full duplex and is fully BT approved. 1200/75 option will allow you to link Protek is a cheap way into The first standard is used for talking into Micronet and Prestel. the world of communica. to other Protek modems and sending The cost is just , which really is tions.

"back to the program's menu, you can't actually send an ESCape character to Prestel. This rules out colour-coded Mailboxes and pretty frame designs. The Commodore 64 version suffers from the same problems and also lacks a return key as this is used for a Prestel hash character (#). This means that, at the moment, you can't use the system for connecting to Telecom Gold, despite Protek's claims to the contrary. The Spectrum version is awful. Instead of displaying the Prestel screen as it comes down the phone line character by character, it waits for the whole frame and then displays it at the end. So when you call up a page, you have to wait quite a few seconds before it appears. Just like teletext and rather disappointing. If only the software was as good as the modem.

Join Alice in her journey through Videoland an enchanted place populated by strange creatures such as bread-andbutterflies and pipe smoking caterpillars; where little girls change size and flamingos turn into croquet mallets! Alice in Videoland is a revolutionary new concept in entertainment for the Commodore 64, incorporating some of the finest graphics ever seen on any home computer, accompanied by a charming musical score. There are four different game scenes involved, and your performance in earlier ones will affect your ability to get through later ones and determine your eventual total score. Scene One Stunning title page graphics give way to the first game scene as Alice falls into the rabbit's warren. Score points for collecting the objects to be found there including keys to open doors, bottles to make her smaller, cakes to make her bigger! Scene Two Out in the garden the Cheshire cat looks on as Alice meets the pipe-smoking caterpillar. Help her to catch the bread-and-butterflies and the rocking-horse flies that change into the balls used in the croquet game in the last scenel Scene Three Alice is a pawn in the chess game where her opponents are the Jabberwocky and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Help her across the board by protecting her with your White Knights! Scene Four The most bizarre croquet game ever! Help Alice hit the balls through the playing-card-soldier hoops before the Queen of Hearts stomps on them! Alice in Videoland is available for the Commodore 64 on disk .95, and now on cassette .95.
