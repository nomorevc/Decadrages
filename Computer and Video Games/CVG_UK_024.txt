Dear Sir, I write to you concerning Mr Paul Ippaso's letter (Mailbag, July) dealing with Defender variations for the Atari and BBC micros. Judging from his views it is clear that he has a grudge against the BBC for some reason. As a BBC owner, I admit that the variety and excellent quality of Atari software is unchallengeable but a price has to be paid. The cost of a program for the Atari is, on average, three times the price of those for the BBCof the same quality Mr Ippaso also says that it's easier to play Defender with joysticks. I disagree, although I must admit that it took quite a while to master the keyboard functions but once mastered it's just as easy as a joystick. Anyway Planetoids can be played with Quickshot joysticks from Microstyle. Mr Ippaso also seems to & think that Acornsoft are the only quality manufacturers of BBC programs (joke!?). Has he never heard of Big Byte, JJK, Superior Soft, 2 Micropower etc, etc who KONG WITH A BUG? COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 9 "


"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPETI WIN THE OUR ,000 GAME OF CHALLENGE THE FILM David Lightman is our idea of the average Computer and Video Games reader. He enjoys playing video games, is nuts about computers and is a bit of a rebel at heart. David is the star character of a new film all about computers called War Games which should be at your local cinema very soon. David is a whizz at getting computers to do just what he wants them to. He even persuades the school computer to change his grades for him so he won't have to do extra work during the summer holidays. But he gets into real trouble when he inadvertently contacts a mysterious computer system while attempting to bootleg some brand new games from a software company using his trusty modem. The \"games\" he finds are not designed for livening up a wet afternoon. He has unwittingly tapped into the American Defence Department's war games computer, called JOSHUA. And the \"game\" he wants it to play could end in all-out nuclear war and the destruction of this planet! You'll have to see the film to find out what happens. You can play a safer version of the deadly game David gets involved in thanks to Thorn-EMI. They have just released a major new title called Computer War based on the theme of the film. And Computer and Video Games have six of these brand new games to give away thanks to Thorn-EMI. All you have to do is answer the three questions below about computers featured in recent hit movies and send your answers, on postcards only please, to War Games, Computer and Video David (Matthew Broderick) and Jennifer (Ally Sheedy) in a scene from WarGames. Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London, ECIR SEJ. Thom-EMI are producing the games for the Vic-20, Texas TI 99/4a and the Atari 400/800 — so please tell us which computer you own on your postcard, otherwise we won't be able to send you your prize. The first six correct answers out of the C&VG memory bin will receive a prize. Normal competition rules apply and the editor's decision is, as usual, final. The questions are as follows: 1. What was the name of the evil computer which took over the spaceship in Stanley Kubrick's film 2001? 2. In Walt Disney's Tron, another evil computer was out to take over the world. What was it called? 3. A famous comic book hero has recently been battling it out with a heavily armed computer system in the latest movie about his adventures. What is his name? Remember, please put your answers on a postcard or stuckdown envelope. It makes sorting out your entries so much easier for our hardworking competition crew. The closing date for entries is October 16th so get those brains in gear! Put a special effort into your next program -it could be worth ,000. There's ,000 in good honest cash going to the winner of our August competition to find Britain's brightest programming talents. The prize comes from Calisto Software of Birmingham which is keen to expand the number of machines it Covers and use home-grown programmers rather than ship in games from the US Calisto's Mike Woodroffe believes it takes three months to write a good games program and that's what you've got. If you're starting from scratch, your program must be finished by October 16th If you are going to polish up one of your previous efforts, then why not send it quickly and get started on another program. You can enter as many programs as you like as long as each comes with an entry form cut from the magazine. To enter, simply fill in the form below and attach it to a cassette of the game. Make sure you fill in all the details about yourself and your game on the form If the game instructions are not included on the cassette itself, then add them on a separate piece of paper but please ensure that your name and address are included on every part of your entry. The winner will be the reader who comes up with the best commercial program, and Calisto will also pay royalties on all copies sold. Remember all published entries will be given a software contract, possibly worth a lot of money. The judging time is limited so get your entry in as quickly as possible but be sure that your program is properly polished first, to give yourself a good chance of coming away ,000 richer.

"The unbeatable TI Home Computer. It's all the computers your family will ever need. Buying a home computer is something you have to get right first time. It's too late when you've got one to find it won't take plug-in software. Or can't be programmed without an expensive accessory The TI Home Computer is a real computer system The TI Home Computer has got the memory power you might expect from more expensive computers, built in. Atits heart is a powerful TMS 9900 16-BIT Microprocessor. Most other home computers have only an 8-BIT. And you can expand the memory from 16K of RAM up to 52K. The total memory capacity is 114K Bytes. A wide range of software for everyone Another feature that makes the TI system so powerful, yet so easy to use is Solid State Software. These plugin cartridges cover everything from space games like Parsec\" to teaching maths, managing home finances and composing music. And the range is getting wider all the time. More than one programming language The standard programming language, TI BASIC, is built into your TI Home Computer so you can begin programming right away. But there's an expanded range of optional languages like Extended BASIC, TI Logo, USCD-Pascal, TI FORTHand Assembler. With these you can fully expand your programming skills. A wide range of peripherals Most computers lose a lot of memory when you add peripherals. The TI Home Computer is different. Every peripheral comes with its own built-in programs to keep the loss of memory to a minimum The convenient Peripheral Expansion System houses up to eight peripherals. Additional hardware cards simply plug in. You can even add a complete Floppy Disk Memory System. The peripherals include memory expansion, RS232 Interface, P-Code card and more. There's also a sophisticated matrix printer and Solid State Speech synthesizer which you can use with your own TI BASIC programs. A lot more for no more The TI Home Computer gives you so much more without costing more. At today's price it's exceptional value. Take your family round to try one. If you never try it you'll never know what you're missing It even has what professionals look for in a home computer CPU: TMS 9900 16-BIT, plus 256-byte Scratchpad RAM. Memory: Total 114K bytes; 26K bytes ROM internal; up to 36K ROM cartridges external; 16K built-in RAM expandable to 52K bytes. Keyboard:48 Key QWERTY, alphalock, function key auto repeat.

He's just become the first person to discover the secret of Manic Miner that's all! Jim Wills completed all twenty screens of Bug Byte's latest offering for the 48k Spectrum. Jim, pictured here, had only completed 15 screens of the massive game. Then he read our review in C&VG and learned of the prize on offer for the first person to complete the game. He dug out his cassette again and finished the remaining five screens in just one afternoon! Jim will win a new colour TV to use with his Spectrum, and you should be able to catch him at this year's Personal Computer World Show where he'll be displaying his talents and offering a challenge to other Manic Miner freaks. If YOU have completed the game then you should send details to Bug Byte in Liverpool. Tell them your name, address, phone number and score. And don't forget to tell them the secret! You'll be invited to play again to prove that you really can finish the game, and there will be prizes for the fastest players. The presentation should take place around Christmas time. Meanwhile, does anyone out there know how to get past the Mutant Telephones? LUNA CRABS Luna Crabs and Haunted Hedges are two new 3D-style arcade games for the Spectrum. These two all-machine code games are carefully constructed to achieve the correct 3D perspective and push the Spectrum's graphics capabilities to the limit, according to the manufacturers Micromega. Luna Crabs returns to the essential simplicity of the classic arcade games. The crabs behave semi-intelligently, swarming and bunching in changing patterns, and hiding behind hills to reemerge at unexpected intervals. The patterns are reset for each round, so the player cannot learn how to beat the computer. The photon bolts used to blast the crabs are steerable so you have more chance to hit a moving target. Haunted Hedges is a new version of the most popular arcade concept of all the maze chase. The features include full 3-D visual effects. An animated figure with arms and legs moving as it chases and is chased around the maze. The intelligence level of the ghosts is included as a variable the player can set. Full instructions are included on screen, and again the controls have been simplified. A feature of the programming is that the player can chose which keys suit him best to control the action at the start of the game. Illustrations: Jon Davis "

"Eddie Mitchell's letter about the prices of Atari software sparked off a great debate among owners of this versatile micro. Here at the C&VG offices we've received many letters agreeing with his comments. So we decided to look further at that subject which is obviously close to your pockets! Dear Sir, Reading Eddie Mitchell's comment on the highly priced Atari 400/800 software, I find myself in a similar position of having a great machine and not being able to afford the advertised programs. However, through this demand a few software hire clubs have sprung up recently, giving us a chance to sample the previously forbidden fruit for hire charges of approx .50 a fortnight. What has become apparent is the fact that although these are excellent examples of programming and they exploit the Atari machines to the fullest, they lose their appeal after a while, being almost demo programs for interested visitors to my house. I feel that as more and more Atari owners hire software, they will be more selective about where that .99 goes, whereas if they only were spending -12 on a program, their shelves would fill up with seldom played games. In short, all you software houses out there are cutting your own throats by selling Atari progs at .00 plus, because its only a matter of time until local programmers get to grips with a range of games, utilities etc at realistic prices. Geoff Redburn, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. Dear Sir, Admittedly Atari produce very good computers, and now that their prices include the basic cartridge and in some places you also get a free Pac-Man cartridge, they represent far better value than a while ago. The games are of a high quality, but my grumble is that they are so expensive. I can understand  for a cartridge as they are more expensive to produce, but when you get cassettes selling for - it's a bit too much for my 1k brain to handle. Two software houses that produce Atari games cartridges or tapes that are high quality and actually affordable are Llamasoft-who produce the excellent Gridrunner for the Atari at only .50 and English Software which produces games for .95. Jason Brown, Malton, N. Yorkshire. Dear Sir, I have observed with interest other readers recent comments regarding the capabilities of the Atari 400 vs. others. best \"under  home micro\", but for how long? I will endorse the fact that the Atari 400 is undoubtedly the The trouble with Atari is they have drastically reduced the price for the 400 (much to my chagrin I paid nearly  for mine two years ago) but their software, although definitely of the best quality, is still astronomically priced in the UK compared to prices in the USA Several prospective micro buyers who I have contact with will not buy an Atari because of the high cost of the software. the UK they ought to closely examine their games prices and I suggest that if Atari wish to maintain their top position in reduce them to something compatible with the cost of the computer. Eric Bacon, Worksop, Dear Sir, Referring to Mr. Mitchell's letter in your last Mailbag I fully agree with his comments on expensive Atari programs. I have owned my Atari 400 for approximately two years, still having purchased only two programs due to inflated prices compared with other machines. If Atari do not pull their socks up soon on prices, it will be soon overtaken by future new hardware at lower prices. Most computer magazines have plenty of programs for many makes of computer but very little for the Atari. J. A. Thompson, Bognor Regis, Sussex.

The Supercharger and Phaser Patrol package will set you back .95. Games tapes cost around .95. Now read on.. STOMP THAT surely could do better than that Meanwhile, on with the sceDRAGON! nario.

"TELE -R COLLINS No arcade supplement would be complete without them, those little green aliens who invaded the hearts of millions and began the video boom all those years ago. We've looked through our files and uncovered a version of the game that launched a thousand aliens. This version of the classic video game has it all. Four rows of different coloured aliens. A mother ship which when hit registers a mystery score. Multiple bombs, six screens of varying difficulty. All this and the sound effects too! Keys to control your laser bases are Z for left, X for right. The space bar fires your laser. Type the program in using Mode 6. All instructions are in BBC/Microsoft Basic apart from: 1. Function FNHIT which uses the Acorn PEEK (?) to examine the screen location in front of the Bombs and Bullets. 2. *Fx calls *11, 1 to speed up the keyboard. 15, 1 to prevent excessive keyboard repeats. 3. *TV 255 to lower the TV display. 4. Vou to disable the cursor (lines 10, 20, 30, 180) A = Start of print of Invaders in the For:Next loop B = Finish of print in the For: Next loop C = Step Value (+ or -2) in the For: Next loop AL to DL = Count of \"Shot\" Invaders. Used to prevent line print if all Invaders shot B1 (1 to 2) = Character position of random Bomber B2 (1 to 2) = Line position of Bomb B3 = prevents print of space (if value 2) on initial bomb drop B4 (1 to 10) = Invader Column. When value = 4 complete column destroyed. F1 = Character position of Bullet F2 = Line position of Bullet F3 = Character position (F1) converted to position of Invader in String (AS to DS) H = Height of Invader line (in TAB) N = Character Position of Base (in TAB) NT & ST are Time Variables. ST used at Program Start and Mothership. NT in Main Loop. NT is adjusted after shooting a full screen. AS to DS (1 to 20) = Line of Invaders in sets 1 to 10, 11 to 20 for movement. AAS (1 to 3). = Display of lines left (as Bases) A% = Step in main loop to spacefill the AS DS after shooting an Invader. C%*= Record of full screens \"shot\". Adjusts score, start line and Time loop. H% = Used in Mothership processing. 1% = Sets up AS to DS. J% = General For:Next Loops. L% = Used in Scoring. M% = Used in moving Laser Base.

This should have the effect of moving the aliens down every reversal on SKILL 2 (this is the existing SKILL level), and every other line on SKILL 1. Also, for the real enthusiast, Assembler routines to move the Mother Ship and Bullets and Bombs would give a much smoother flow to the game, overcoming even the BBC Basic's slowness.

"ARCADE BY STEPHEN SHAW ARENA -R. COLLINS SLALOM RUNS ON A TEXAS TI 99/4a Slalom racing is for the skier who knows his sport. Only the best can cope with the sweeps and swirls of the giant slalom course. You'll have to be a real cool customer to deal with the dangers that lurk under the snow like ice or hidden rocks. You must take them all into your stride as you hurtle down the slope at break-neck speeds. Author Stephen Shaw has come up with a challenging simulation of the real thing. He says runs one to three are fairly easy easy, for the experienced downhill skier that is! Run four is moderately difficult which could mean anything from almost fatal to near impossible — but after that the runs get harder! As this is an Arcade Arena game we'll want to hear about your top scores. Stephen has given us a guide to good scores on his game which we'll pass on to you. If you get over 4,000 then you can consider yourself a good skier — but you'll have to do better if you want to fill in the coupon at the start of this section. If you score 6,000 then you are on your way to stardom. If you race your way to 8,000 then we want to hear from you! Send us a postcard from the ski resort where you've been practising ... This game will also run in TI Extended Basic. Use the top row of the keyboard to control your skier. 560 SCORE=SCORE+10#TRY 570 NEXT INC 580 SCORE=SCORE +50+TRY 590 PRINT 600 PRINT \"SCORE:\"; SCORE 610 PRINT \"LIVES LEFT:\";LIFE 620 PRINT \"RUN\":TRY;\" COMPLETED\" 630 PRINT 640 PRINT \"ANOTHER RUN COMING UP...\" 650 PRINT 660 PRINT 670 FOR INC=1 TO RND+500 + 700 680 NEXT INC 690 TRY=TRY+1 700 GOTO 180 710 CALL CLEAR 720 PRINT \"SORRY YOU RAN OUT OF LIVES 730 PRINT \"SCORE: \"; SCORE 740 PRINT \"YOU TERMINATED IN RUN\":\"NUMBER:\"; TRY 750 PRINT \"AGAIN?

We could shape of the ship. have plotted the initial spaceship as a It distintegrates into four parts when a single character and then made its fragkey is pressed and one of these parts ments sprites all based on a single divides again when another key is character too. But since each character pressed.

In this way the sprite occupies a block of four by four character positions and is really quite large. With CALL MAGNIFY (2) sprites consist of only one character but are plotted at double size. The program takes advantage of this to produce four single character sprites for the fragment that are equivalent to the original four character sprite. Giving them different velocities makes the fragments of the ship fly apart. Note that in changing from CALL MAGNIFY (4) to CALL MAGNIFY (2) sprite # 1 changes from a four-character sprite to a single character one as shown in the diagram. The second fragmentation is accomplished by deleting the sprite corresponding to the top left fragment and replacing it by three sprites all defined on a single character so that their combined shapes are equivalent to that of the one they replace. Giving these new sprites yet further different velocities causes the further disintegration. The CALL POSITION subprogram is used to find the position of a sprite just before it disintegrates so that its fragments can initially appear in the same position. It is necessary to use a small offset for some of the fragments since this subprogram returns to the position of the top left point of the sprite. The subprogram CALL MOTION is used to change the motion of sprite # 1. You might find it interesting to use this program as the basis of a number of variations. 6 # 1 #3 58 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"BY S. CITYNSKYJE RUNS ON AN APPLE II EUROPLUS IN 48K o ? DO STARDUST str. O. Catch some falling stardust and store it in your spaceship\" runs a line in a little song favoured by space pilots. And strangely enough that's just what you have to do in our latest cosmic challenge. The theme is straightforward enough. You must steer your spacecraft around the universe collecting stardust. There is a hazard however giant moon-rocks are whizzing around you in an extremely dangerous manner. These rocks get ever more numerous as you move further into the game. There is also a constant battle to avoid running out of fuel. To help you keep going, starbases appear randomly during the game which you must dock with if your fuel supply is to be replenished. Full instructions are included in the program. Although the game uses colour graphics it can be run using a black and white screen. If you don't have colour then change the variables in line 183 which should then read: Ci=11: C3=9: C4=5: C5=15. This will ensure better screen clarity.

"The stereo effect is coaxed out of the Spectrum by using magenta, green and yellow instead of red, blue and purple. The red-and-blue spectacles still work with these colours. For reasons of speed, the action of Manhattan Invasion takes place in the foreground only. It is, of course, possible to have action in the background as well the D-Deep machine code game I've been working on for the Spectrum (see Games News) has swift, smooth movement at all depths but in Basic this tends to slow the game down unbearably! In the far distance is a background of skyscrapers separated by dark strips of sky. In the middle ground is a chequered wall. In the foreground there are the enemy invaders plus your own missile base at the bottom of the screen. The idea of the game is to knock out the enemy invaders but if you hit one, it doesn't explode it is just immbolised. None of your missiles can pass through an immobile invader so it acts as a shield for any invaders coming in above it. The invaders attack from left to right and you only score a hit if you prevent them from reaching the right-hand edge of the screen. In each sheet there are eight invaders, all flying at different heights. The higher the invader, the higher you score if you hit it. One game consists of three screens, but if you manage to immobilise a whole screen of invaders, you get a chance at an extra screen.

"SSPURE HOROS RUNS ON AN ATARI This simple but effective game demonstrates well the stereo 3-D capabilities of the Atari computer. As I've already said elsewhere, it's important to get as pure a red and blue as possible for stereo viewing. In this respect the Atari is ideal because you can actually program the intensity or luminance, as the manual calls it of the colours. Thus an excellent colour balance is achieved. In Space-Hog, you take the role of a kamikaze star-pilot take the role of a kamikaze star-pilot who just loves bumping into other spaceships! In the foreground of the scene is a mountain range and just peeping from behind it a second range of mountains deeper into the screen. Scattered throughout the depths of space are asteroids. You pilot a ship at the left-hand edge of the screen and you can control its upward and downward motion plus movement INTO and OUT of the screen. This is vital because your victims are flying from right to left across the screen at any of four different depths, as well as at different heights. For each ship you manage to crash into you gain fifty points -but remember your ship must be at the same depth as the victim to collide. To get maximum screen space for the stereo action, there's no on-screen scoring for Space-Hog. The other compromise made is to restrict movement to only two objects at a time your ship and the victim. it is possible to put more ships on the screen at once but there is a price to pay the game slows down considerably with each extra ship. Having said that, I have included a speed setting which ranges from O (slow) to 9 (fast). Before each game starts you must choose a speed to play. Program notes Lines 520-540 define the red, blue and purple used on screen. The last number on each line defines the colour intensity. I have used values which work well on my TV but if these colours don't come out distinctly on your own TV you should try altering the intensity appropriately. 1 DIM COL (3) 10 GOTO 200 17 REM ---18 REM PRINT SHAPE S AT XX, YY, COLC 19 REM -20 COLOR (S+COL (C): PLOT XX, YY: RETURN 27 REM ---28 REM PRINT OUN SHIP 29 PEM ----30 S=OUN:C=0: XX=OLX:YY OLY: GOSUB20 31 XX=OL:3+OLZ:GOSUB 29 32 OLXEOX:OLY=OY:OL2=OZ 33 IF 02= THEN 36 34 CH 1:XX=0X: Y=OY: GOSUB 20 35 C=2: XX=0X+OZ: GOSUB 20: RETURN 36 C=3: X=OX: YY=OY: GOSUB 20 37 RETURN 47 SM -------49 REM PRINT ENEMY SHIP 49 REM -----50 S=ENEMY:C=0: XX=ELX:YY=ELY: GOSUB 20 5: ELX+ELZ: GOSUB 20 52 IEZE THEN 55 53 C=1:XX=EX: YY=EY: GOSUB 20 54 C=2:XX=EX+EZ: GOSUB 20: RETURN 55 C-3: XX=EX: YY=EY: GOSUB 20 86 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"HORCRUSHA RUNS ON A VIC-20 AND CBM 64 10 GOTO 500 This simple stereo game is essentially the same program on both machines, with slight adjustments for different screen locations, screen sizes and sound commands. The trick used in Crash or Crush to speed up movement in Basic is that most of the moving objects are continually scrolling up the screen. The only object that doesn't scroll is your own \"crusher\" ship which is continually poked in at the top of the screen. Using this trick, it's possible to have ships moving quite quickly at all sorts of depths. You control the \"crusher» at the top of the screen and you can move it left or right or INTO or OUT OF the screen. Coming up the screen at you are asteroids and triangular spaceships. Like a sort of interstellar Steptoe and Son, you are after any old iron and must catch the triangular ships in the arms of your crusher. To do this you not only have to be in the right horizontal position, you also have to be at the right depth.

"into the asteroids but don't worry too much for if they're at the wrong depth they won't harm you. A crash or crush sound accompanies any collision and you score 50 points for crushing a ship but lose 100 points for a crash. The game ends after 250 objects have made their way up the screen The drawback with the scrolling trick is that you can't have on-screen scoring so a separate display deals with this. The other \"odd\" thing about the game is the keyboard scan routine. Some of you may already be familiar with the method but if you aren't, it's something worth remembering for your own games Peeking 197 on the CBM 64 or 203 on the Vic-20 will return a key code corresponding to the last key pressed. It is NOT an ASCII code but an internal keyboard matrix code which you should work out by experiment. The advantage over GET K$ is that you can scan for continual key presses rather than single key presses The Vic version of Crash or Crush runs on a 3.5K Vic but to make it run with more RAM, just alter line 600 which sets the screen start (SS) and colour ram start (CS) location to values appropriate to the 3.5k Vic. On both the Commodore machines, colour balance is critical if you are to see the stereo effect properly. The television may need delicate tuning to get the best colour possible and judicious fiddling with the contrast and brilliance is usually necessary. In particular, don't get the picture too bright. On the CBM 64, I found the colour balance particularly awkward. If you simply can't get the colour right on your 64, try the following alteration to 610: 610 PRINT\" CLS \":: POKE 53280,0: POKE 53281,11 This creates a black border with a dark grey screen and the red and blue are more distinct through each lens. The only drawback is that the image tends to look rather blurred despite the colours contrasting more! 63 IF B1%=81 AND B2%=4 THEN CRASH=CRASH+1: POKE SID+4.:POKE SID+4.129 64 IF A1%=233 AND A2%=4 THEN SO-S0+50:POKE SID+11.:POKE SID+11, 129 66 RETURN 197 REM ---------198 REM MAIN PROGRAM 199 REM ------200 FORK=1T030: PRINT: NEXT 210 GOSUB 20: REM PRINT SHIPS & ASTROIDS 220 GOSUB 50: REM CRASH OR CRUSH ? 230 GOSUB 30: REM PRINT OWN SHIP 240 GOSUB 40: REM SCAN KEYBOARD 250 COUNT=COUNT+1 260 IF COUNT<500 THEN 210 270 GOTO 700 497 REM ------498 REM SET UP SOUNDS 499 REM -------500 SID=54272 510 FOR LEO TO 24:POKE SID+L, 0: NEXT 529 POKE SID+24, 15 530 POKE SID+1,10 540 POKE SID+5,11 550 POKE SID+8,3 560 POKE SID+12, 16*8+11 597 REM ---598 REM SET VARIABLES & SCREEN COLOUR 599 REM ------600 SS=1924: CS=55296 610 PRINT\"\":: POKE53280, 1: POKE5281, 620 S$=\"27 \":R$=\"5 \" 697 REM ---698 REM GAME START 699 REM ---700 PRINT 710 PRINT\" CRASH OR CRUSH\" 720 PRINT:PRINT\" BY MIKE SINGLETON 730 PRINT:PRINT\" FOR COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES\" 740 PRINT:PRINT:PRINT 745 IF SO-CRASH*100 HIGH THEN HIGH-SO-CRASH*100 750 PRINT\" YOU SCORED: SU 760 PRINT:PRINT\" YOU CRASHED: CRASH; \"TIME\" :: IF CRASH 1 THEN PRINT\"S\" 765 PRINT 770 PRINT:PRINT\" YOUR TOTAL PROFIT WAS \"SO-CRASH*100 780 PRINT:PRINT: PRINT\" THE HIGHEST PROFIT SO FAR IS\" HIGH 790 PRINT:PRINT:PRINT\" PRESS S TO START A NEW GAME\" 800 GET G$: IF G >\"S\" THEN 800 819 XX=15:22=2 820 SO=0:CRASH=0: COUNT=0 830 GOTO 299 READY.

"Can you face 1984 without our Yearbook? The C&VG delivery is a real event in this outpost of the galaxy. It only arrives every other millennia when the comet goes past. But this little alien isn't going to miss out, he's just put in an order for The Computer & Video Games Yearbook 1984. There's enough in it to keep him going for a couple of millennia. He'll be playing the four specially commissioned games, converted across a range of micros.  He's going to struggle through The Vespozian Affair, an adventure set on a research space craft, flying between the planets. A He and his alien friend may come to blows when playing The Beacon Star War. Those long fingers may be a handicap when he plays Pirates & Polyps an arcade style game set on a planet surface as a research station tries to track down the valuable polyps before the pirates carry them away. Who can he trust when he plays Interstellar Intrigue, a game of strategy and diplomacy for up to five players. He'll be laughing at a whole load of new Bugs cartoons, Puzzling with Trevor Truran, improving his games writing skills and learning about arcade and video games in a whole range of sparkling features ... No wonder there's a glint in his eye! The Computer & Video Games Yearbook 1984 goes on sale in October and costs .25. UTER SV SPEICAL DE veTM LIVINGSTONE "

Yes, head for the wide open forests and chop them down! Make a bigger splash as you send them rolling down the river toward the big paper mills. You work for a logging company, picking up logs with your towing boat and helping them through the narrows, preventing a massive pile-up of the floating trees. Your aim is to transport as many logs as possible through the narrows without crashing your tow-boat into the banks. A read-out at the top of the screen tells you how much you are earning from the company. You earn the maximum amount of dollars if you keep the build up of logs to the minimum, and you don't crash your boat. The scoring system is as follows: You start with $100 and five two-boats. You'll lose $1 for each log stuck in the bank, $20 for each tow boat destroyed. For each shift successfully worked you'll earn a $25 bonus. Earnings in excess of $500 is considered a good day's wages. When you successfully earn $200 you can hire a dynamite raft which appears in the river. This can be used to clear any large build-up of logs. But it will cost you $20 and only one raft is available. So use it wisely. The game is divided into four shifts lasting about 10 minutes but also depends on how many logs are shifted. A change of shift is indicated by the river bank changing colour, a beep from the computer and the score-board and tow-boat flashing. Shift one, is green, shift two yellow, shift three dark red and shift four dark grey. After typing in the game type in RUN and press return. Then select the skill level you wish to tackle, between one and three. When the tow-boat appears on the screen wait for the signal to start before moving off. This is a high bleep from the computer! 70 TRAP 75: SOUND 1,231, 10, 15:POKE 87, 7: COLOR 2:S=X4-41: T=Y3-23:PL OT S, T: DRAWTO 5+9, T: PLOT S, T+1: DRAWTO 5+9,T+1 75 SOUND 1,0,0,0: RETURN 80 TRAP 90: SOUND 1,231, 10, 10: COLOR 2: POKE 87,7: S=X2-41: T=Y2-23: PL OT S, T: DRAWTO 5+9, T: PLOT S, T+1: DRAWTO 5+9, T+1 85 SL=SL+0.03: POKE 53278, 17: SOUND 1,0,0,0: GOSUB 720: GOTO 298 90 TRAP 95: SOUND 1,0,0,0: PLOT S, T+1: DRAWTO 159, T+1:GOTO 298 95 GOTO 300 100 X1=83: X2=210: X3=5:Y1=67: Y2=INT (RND (O) *30) +40: Y3=32: R=0:L=O: SC 100:PT=0: X5=5: Y5=61:0V=0: 110: PS=0: TM=0: LG=0 110 A=PEEK (106)-24:POKE 54279, A: PB=256*A 120 FOR J-PB+512 TO PB+1023: POKEJ, O: NEXT J 130 POKE 559,46:POKE 53277,3 140 POKE 704,45: POKE 705, 52: POKE 706,52: POKE 707, 206: POKE 53257,1 : POKE 53258,1 145 POKE 53248, X1: POKE 53249, X2:POKE 53250, X3: POKE 53251, X5 148 RESTORE 155 150 FOR JEPB+512+Y1 TO PB+517+Y1 : READ A: POKEJ,A: NEXT J 155 DATA 63, 96,224, 224, 96,63 160 RESTORE 180 170 FOR JEPB+896+YS TO PB+899+Y5: READ B:POKEJ,B: NEXT J 180 DATA 31, 31, 31, 31 195 RESTORE 210 200 FOR J=PB+640+Y2 TO PB+641 +Y2: READ B:POKE J,B: NEXT J 210 DATA 31,31 215 RESTORE 230 220 FOR JEPB+768+Y3 TO PB+769+Y3: READ B:POKE J,B: NEXT J 230 DATA 31, 31 235 IF Q=1 THEN 260 240 GOSUB 3000 250 GOSUB 3100 Illustration: Terry Rogers "

"HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN A MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURE RECENTLY? If so, it is quite probable that you are presently suffering from TIS, more commonly known as Total Involvement Syndrome. TIS manifests itself in a number of ways, one of the most dramatic symptoms being a victim's complete inability to feel at ease in the world of reality. Other symptoms include insomnia a desparate need to play a Mysterious Adventure, and an overwhelming sense of acute enjoyment. Experts believe that Tis is usually contracted as a result of prolonged exposure to Mysterious Adventures, this is commonly caused by owning any of the following Home Computers 48K SPECTRUM. BBC MODEL A OR B, TRS80, COLOUR GENIE, ATARI 400/800, COMMODORE 64, DRAGON 32. 16K ZX81, LYNX etc. When questioned about this epidemic, a representative of DIGITAL FANTASIA, a company who are actively involved in research and development work on Mysterious Adventures said, \"There is probably no cure for TIS other than mains failure, faulty RAM chips etc. which can be at best only a Temporary solution\". \"In the absence of a more permanent cure. I would advise TIS sufferers to submit to the Syndrome and obtain Mysterious Adventures from any sources available to them\"TIS is highly contagious and in view of the current Worldwide Epidemic, I would say enjoy it while you can, resistance is futile\". If you have a BBC Computer, Commodore 64, 48K Spectrum, Atari 400/800, or Dragon 32 you can obtain Mysterious Adventures in any of the following dosages:1) THE GOLDEN BATON 8) THE WIZARD AKYRZ SYESCAPE FROM PULSAR 7 2) THE TIME MACHINE 3) ARROW OF DEATH (PART 1) 9) PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA U16) CIRCUS 10) TEN LITTLE INDIANS 4 ARROW OF DEATH PART 2 7) FEASIBILITY EXPERIMENT Each Dose costs .95 including V.A.T. and Postage.

"CHOOSING WARNING) A HOME MICRO Choosing a home micro can be a daunting task to the newcomer, and with an ever increasing number of micros emerging on the market, even up-grading, say, from a ZX81 can be a risky and expensive exercise if the wrong decision is made. It is important to look at the real facts and specifications, and check exactly what you get for your money before choosing your micro-computer system. High Quality Sound Some computers claim to provide a sound channel when in reality all that can be found inside the computer is a small buzzer controlled by electronic pulses. At the very least a sound facility should provide more than one channel and a raise channel as well (for gun shot effects in games for example). The best systems also provide envelope control of the sound channels to produce very sophisticated effects: very important for generating music. Also look for the ability to connect to external amplifiers THE PITFALLS \"DONT LET THE ADD ONS ADD UP\" A number of large companies are offering packages that seem to be good value and low cost. These offers usually have a hidden sting inasmuch as the essential accessories such as connection leads, peripherals and software often carry very high cost premiums. e.g. software for low cost hardware usually costs between $29 and $49 for a ROM cartridge!! CHECK THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. Raw materials are now an area where comers can be cut and shoddy workmanship during 'building can effect the 'up-time of your unit. Areas to watch out for are unreliable edge connectors, corrosion and poor quality P.C.B.s. Low quality components and bad design will seriously effect the reliability of the end product, and can lead to false economy. DONT BUY A GAMES MACHINE Unless you want just games and nothing else! With a games computer you are limited. Some computers, however, have the advantage of both games facility plus the whole world of computing to explore, as your interest and skills develop. A real computer system will allow you to expand your knowledge of the Hi-Technology world, and help earn its keep with its added uses in the field of education, communication and home business use. SOFTWARE Make sure the system you choose has a growing library of support software, to enable you to realize the full potential of your machine. KEY POINTS TO LOOK FOR High Resolution Colour In general most home computers have a poor graphics resolution (or detail). Check on the vertical and horizontal resolution in graphic mode and multiply the two numbers together. If the result is less than 35,000, then the graphics can hardly be considered high resolution Without high resolution graphics displays such as those used in games tend to be \"Chunky\" in appearance Keyboard For accurate entry of programs and data into a computer it is important that the keyboard has a good tactile feel in operation. Coupled with acoustic feedback the user is fully aware when the computer has accepted his/her actions. Also of importance in a keyboard is layout. A standard computer keyboard layout will familiarise the user with the vast majority of computers used in the world of business and professional applications: very important if the purpose of purchasing a computer is educational RAM One of the most important features of a computer is the amount of RAM or memory, included. In general the more powerful and exciting a computer program is the more RAM it requires. But take care, all computers are advertised quoting the total RAM used in the system. Computers use up a great deal of their own RAM for storing essential data and particularly in supporting the graphics display and the CPU. If it is less than 32K think again, is it enough? Choosing the right system carefully will save you from throwing your money away Check full specification, plus peripherals and software prices, before you buy. Preferably choose a Real computer system that can expand to meet your needs. computer system that will grow with you; able to accommodate Printers Disk-drives, Joysticks, Communications Modem, and Colour Monitor, as well as produce HI-FI sound effects. Software The computer you choose should have a growing selection of utility software to make the most of its capability, Remember, computing is here to stay. You can't learn to compute on a toy, or a device which does not behave like a real computer In short, look out for a computer which offers all the points above and you will be sure of getting the best value for money Computer Language It is too dificult to program a computer in its own binary language so high level languages are used the most popular being BASIC. However, there are a number of BASICS. some being very different from the rest. A de facto standard in the computer industry is Microsoft BASIC Learn this one and you will be able to program in the majority of computer BASICS: such an important point if a home computer is to be used to educate your children to face the technology of the future. Expansion As your interest and knowledge of computing grows, you will need a To find out which company offers you the right choice, with:Good value, high specification, quality micros.

Machine code programs will probably prove tricky, because the memory maps of the two machines are different. Details of this and other services, plus subscription prices, from the membership secretary Jack Cohen at ICPUG, 30 Brancaster Road, Newbury Park, Ilford, Essex IG2 TEP VIC TIPS WHERE ARE YOU TRS-80? We've been accused recently of neglecting the trusty old TRS-80 in favour of the newer micros. The reason for this is simple we haven't received any TRS80 programs which are considered suitable for publishing. So if you'd like to see a good game published for the Tandy machine then why not write one and send it to us. We pay  for any listings published Meanwhile for all frustrated Tandy owners, here's a few tips for a TRS-80 model I using level II Basic courtesy of Sunil Parekh of Manchester. The mem-size is stored in locations 16561 and 16562. To program it, use the following routine, 10 INPUT \"MEM SIZE\":M 20 M=M-2 30 POKE 16562,INT(M/256) 40 POKE 16561,M-INT(M/256) *256 You can also merge programs on this computer. It's easy if you follow some simple rules. Part 2 statements must have higher line numbers than part 1. Put part 1 in memory and type PRINT So much for my bit about splitting 3.5k Vic programs into two sections. This works perfectly as long as we remember to print both sections! Look at BrickUp in our August issue. Apologies to all concerned, especially author Philip Smith. Here's what you've been waiting PEEK (166 Type in one of the following lines. If the number printed from above was less than 2 then use line A, otherwise use line B. A: POKE 16548,PEEK(16633),' + 254:POKE 16549,PEEK(16634)-1 B: POKE 16548,PEEK(16633) 2:POKE 16549,PEEK(16634)  CLOAD part 2  Type the following:POKE 16548,233:POKE 16549,66 Your programs have now been merged, list them and see. SPACE LASER TI 99/4a We've been sent an improved listing of Space Laser for the Texas as published in our November '82 issue. If you'd like a copy, then drop us a line and an sae and we'll send you one post office haste. Please mark the envelope Space Laser Listing USERS GROUP If you own a Commodore computer, you may not be aware of ICPUG, that's the Independent Commodore Products User Group. Annual membership cost includes help and advice, a newsletter and free programs (you send them a blank disc or cassette and they do the rest). One such program which I use is a neat utility for owners of 8000 series Pets. This short routine allows an 80 column machine to simulate a 40 column screen, which should allow a fair proFrom Gareth Jones of Cleveleys comes a tip for Vic owners. SYS 256 is the same as LOAD, So you could put this at the end of the first listing in a two-part program. You can change nibblers so that it automatically loads nibblers II by changing line 19 of the first program to PRINT \"CLR SCRN LOADING NIBBLERS 2\": SYS 256. Remember to leave the tape recorder in play mode after listing one has loaded 3D ROAD RACE TI 99/4a The 3D road-race program also in our July issue works correctly. Honest! The only error was some faint printing in line 2120, but at least we printed it in black and white this time. The end of the line should read DIR=1. FROGGER TI 99/4a Just when you thought it was safe to go back to your TI, the Bugs moved in again! Although the Frogger game from the Games Extra in July issue works perfectly and provides a good game in hi-res graphics, the write-up warns of such menaces as turtles, snakes, alligators and a timer on the bottom of the screen. Well, to put it bluntly, they're not there. The information from the author mentioned them so we passed the information on to you! What happened to these characters? We don't know! But obviously we will try to find them and publish the missing lines in a future issue. 10 FORI=7168 T07511 20 READA POKEL.

BALLOONACYATARI For all those balloonatics who couldn't get our August program to run correctly, here's some advice from someone with an illegible signature who lives in Claybrooke Magna, Leicester. While balloonacy works fine on 16k machines, it locks up when typed into a 32 or 48k Atari. If this happens on your machine try changing line 110 to 110 RT=PEEK(106 :POKE 106,RT-8: GRAPHICS 18 and all should then be well again. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 123 "


"ABF PROGRAMMABLE JOYSTICK 3295 INTERFACE ONLY 32.95 +90pp for The Spectrum r ZX81 ABOUT OUR PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACE Surpassing the outstanding specification of our Interface Module Il which still offers the best software support at its price, a Joystick Interface that is compatible with ALL SOFTWARE through its unique hardware programmable design. The Interface plugs on to the rear connector of your ZX81 or ZX Spectrum. Quick clip-on connections, which are con figured from a reference card supplied, allow you to define which of the forty keys are simulated by which action of the Joystick. A pack of ten Quick Reference Programming Cards makes setting for your favourite games even easier.

They come from Scotland, Clwyd, Yorkshire, Sussex, Norfolk, Merseyside, BFPO South Atlantic, the Midlands and many other places, and are about Hobbits and Dragons, Pirates and Dia-Ice-Hounds, Asyla, Deathmazes, Pyramids and Fun Houses. Especially Fun Houses!! I delight in reading every one of them, and thank you all for your encouragement and help. There's no way I can give each of you a mention -a list of names filling a whole page makes incredibly monotonous reading! So forgive me if yours is one of the letters I miss out. All of them will be filed, then cross referenced and entred on to a disc file, so that, hopefully, tips can be matched to the questions you want answered. Be assured of one thing, Adventurers out there desperate for help you are not alone! Someone, somewhere is struggling just as hard as you, and without doubt someone else has the very answer you crave and will be glad to help you!

Oh, and one thing more please mention the micro to which you are referring LOST UP A LADDER.. When Scott Adams translated Adventureland from Basic into machine code, he set a standard, started a series, and popularised Adventure games for mic ros. He wrote for the TRS-80, and all his Adventures have since been converted for a variety of other micros. Brian Howarth's Mysterious Adventure series, available for a number of machines, also started life on a TRS-80. Many different micros have appeared on the scene since, and in their wake, a new generation of Adventure games written for them. Few have had the same magical appeal, and even less have been converted, The TRS-80, although lacking hi-res graphics, has some very powerful features. It is a pity that these days it is becoming a little neglected. So I was highly delighted to see that some promising new TRS-80 Adventures have recently been published. On the recommendation of Dave Gould, an enthusiast from Hythe in Kent, I tried my hand at Temple of Bast. Temple of Bast is written by Malcolm McMahon, who has a mind every bit as devious as Scott Adams! The aim is to get hold of a gold ingot in ancient Egypt -so I'm told. Unfortunately, I am still in a musty old house in London, and I can't even get out on to the street! Being a Power Engineer, sorting out the house wiring caused me no problems. With supply on down in the workshed, I happily started to saw up everything in sight! My band saw made a real mess of a spaghetti tin, and soon I had a collection of very diverse items. I felt I was supposed to make something with them. Trouble wasI couldn't for the life of me guess what! Things then ground to a complete halt -I'd have given my back teeth to a gorilla to discover something new! So in came the family, muttering: \"call himself the Adventure expert?\" and duly solved the immediate problem! I'd been overdoing it with the saw, and things were now literally looking up! I must discover how to be less clumsy. As a gardener, my forte is cutting grass. I should have studied the care of roses, I suppose, because obviously I don't know the right jargon. Temple of Bast is a good Adventure even before the action moves to its main setting, and it has a great sense of humour. I can't wait to reach Egypt! The difficulty in reviewing a game as good as this is that I want to share with you the funnies and the excitement, but have to restrain myself to avoid spoiling your game! Let's hope we will see more from Malcolm McMahon in the near future. Meanwhile, Temple of Bast is available from Molimerx Ltd. It runs in on TRS-80 and Video Genie in 16k on cassette for .06, and in 32k on disk for .51. ADVENTURE HELPLINE Can YOU: Escape the deserted wastelands in Knight's Quest, and help W.

GIANT LEAP FOR BBC FROG FANS HOPPER All your space-born skills will be needed to protect this convoy of spaceships in a mad dash across the universe! Escorting a convoy through the galaxy, you are suddenly pitched into battle. You find yourself surrounded by hordes of aliens and in the middle of a meteor storm. The idea is to dodge the meteors as they whizz through space from all directions and avoid the aliens as they attempt to collide with you. Your space craft is equipped with canisters of a deadly gas and your only hope of protecting the convoy is to release this in clouds in the path of an alien or meteor. On contact with the gas the opposition is annihilated. Six cloudbursts of gas can be released at any one time, and, if you find yourself in a tight corner it's possible to hide in one until you can make good your escape. Should your reactions be too slow to avoid a collision, you will be blown to bits in a very colourful explosion. You have six lives and a minimum of 40 seconds to score 1000 points before moving on to the next level. The game becomes more difficult on each succeeding level as the points scored for eliminating the aliens decrease and points deducted for allowing your convoy to be blown up increase. This makes it much harder to clock up 1000 points in the 40 second period. Strategic planning is necessary in Violent Universe so check how many points are awarded when you blow up the meteors, aliens and aircraft and plan your game accordingly. In this way you will be able to get to the higher levels of the game where the action becomes fast and furious as you try to beat the time limit. On reaching level 4 and all subsequent levels, you become eligible to enter the Hall of Fame THE hi-score competition by sending in your score to Fantasy together with the special Hopper now takes a massive leap from the arcade to your home, taking all the characteristics of the arcade classic with it! This version from Acornsoft incorporates high-res graphics and sound displaying a clear and concise screen layout The object of the game as if you didn't already know is to manoeuvre the frog across four busy lanes of traffic and on to a midway bank, which in later screens is patrolled by deadly snakes Then you have to jump over a river torrent where two lanes of logs swirl down-stream and two lanes of turtles swim in the opposite direction. The turtles must be used as stepping stones. You can pick up dragonfly on the way for bonus points. Some turtles have the habit of diving from under you, while the occasional alligator is waiting in your bank-side home. I found the game available for the BBC computer enjoyable to play and remarkably good value, for only .95. Other cheaper versions exist for the BBC but the graphics can't compare to the Acornsoft version.

Tel: 0509 412604 From the people who brought you \"3D Tunnel\" comes another superb game. Knot in 3D is a surround type game where you and the computer travel around the screen leaving trails which you must avoid This 3D version is clever and well written. The game is the straightforward surround but the screen is replaced by a large 3D space in which you are travelling. You steer yourself in four directions using the cursor keys which are adequate but take some getting used to. The trails left by yourself and the computer are depicted in fantastic 3D and come towards you at quite a speed. The trails soon fill up the space and it becomes harder to find a path through the knots. You can enter a demonstration mode after loading the tape, which provides a stunning display of the graphics capable from a Spectrum. Most 3D games have either a graphics display or are an addictive playable game but not both, this is one of the few that combine these qualities. Knot in 3D from New Generation Software runs on a 48k Spectrum and is well worth the .95 price tag. Getting started Graphics  Value  Playability graphics, the man is badly animated and drawn.

MIND GAMES (CVG), 2 Frome Close, Irby, Wirral L61 4YD Your task in this game is to steer the dashing dauber through a maze painting it as he goes. If the maze was drawn in anything like true 3D then the game could be very popular unfortunately it's not. The mazes themselves are drawn in two dimensions but have shadows behind them to resemble 3D. Unfortunately this idea does not work too well. There are some marvellous 3D paths produced by the method but the painter simply wanders round the outside. There are four mazes in all to complete. I managed the first one after about five minutes but assumed that the other three would be harder. I was mistaken. I managed to clear all four mazes after about ten minutes play and the game then had no further appeal to me. The game uses no high resolution | The perfect arcade game is a combination of superb graphics and a challeng. ing game. Terror Daktil from melbourne House, the people who brought you the Hobbit, is half perfect. The graphics are among the best that I have ever seen on a micro, but the game itself is fairly ordinary if not boring. In a place forgotten by time, says the blurb, the beating of wings heralds an incarnation too horrible to believe... the dreaded monsters swoop down intent on your destruction. The idea in this game is to destroy the terror-daktils which inhabit the strange land onto which your plane has just crashed. A pilot's eye view of the crash is displayed before the game actually begins although this can be skipped if you wish. The crash portrayed is almost too realistic and in superb 3D. I found myself looking under the seat for that paper bag. (It wasn't there.) After the emergency you find your self alone on a plateau somewhere in the South-American Jungle. In the distance you suddenly see some strange creatures grouping together. Is it a space invader?, is it a Pac-Person? No it's the terror-daktils. Your only hope of survival in this situation is to drag out an old cannon which you find and use it to fire at the gathering terror-daktils. You can move the cannon in four directions although it 48K SPECTRUM Three entirely new programs available for this machine 1. HELMSMAN. A sophisticated yacht simulator 2. DIRECTOR.

Wizard Software ARCADE ACTION does not physically move up and down, vertical movement being shown by a digital degree indicator instead. Occasionally a single terror-daktil breaks away from the group and sweeps towards you. Again the graphics are superb. The beast itself is beautifully drawn and comes towards you in 3D, growing larger as it approaches. If its claws touch you then you lose one of your three lives. As for the game itself, there's little more to it than that. If you survive for six days and six nights then a rescue plane will come to your aid. The game cycles through day and night by changing the screen colour so that's what the fourth dimension is. If you want to show off your Spectrum's graphics to your friends then this is the game for you.

MAIL ORDER TO UK ONLY LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL 3D TUNNEL The Texas entry in this year's Grand Prix for road race games is Car Wars. It's a dodgems-type game and follows the course of the Pac Man on Wheels original. The screen shows a racing circuit with five lanes, and four places where you can change lanes by a flick of the joystick. The track is strewn with dots and the idea is to race your car through the screen collecting these Pac-Man style. Your opponent in the race is a computer controlled car which travels in the opposite direction. Selecting the latter takes you into demo mode where you can sit and watch cars racing around the track and changing lanes. To get out of demo you press any key and you then set the diffficulty. There are two categories to set and each has three levels. The speed of the cars can be creeping, fast or flying but both must be the same. As an added danger the computer's car speeds up during the game by a factor of about three. You can allow this to happen early, late or \"look out\"! Also on screen is a high score indicator and a set of lights which tell you when to start racing by flashing from red to green. A nice touch. If you crash into the computer's car or it crashes into you which is far more likely you lose one of your three lives. In terms of graphics a crash is the best part of the game. Grey smoke clouds billow from the cars and coloured pieces of wreckage fly out in all directions rotating as they fall. You can buy Car Wars from your Texas stockist on cartridge for .95. If you like dodgems then you'll find this quite playable although this is not helped by the awkward joysticks.

The running movement of Mario in this Anirog version is the most ungainly video game animation I have seen in a long time. It looks like Mario has got a limp!

"MACHINE CODE AWAY FROM THE ABSTRACT We have been looking at assembly language and machine code in a somewhat abstract fashion, in terms of what individual instructions or short sequences of instructions do to the processor registers and the computer's memory, rather than how to get programs into the machine and run them to get some practical effect. The practical details vary according to the computer you have and the software you use to help with machine code programming, but there are some general principles. You will need two pieces of software, an assembler and a machine code monitor. You may find that these come in the same package, or that you have one or the other built in to your computer for example the Lynx has a built in machine code monitor, and the BBC micro has a built in assembler. A machine code monitor consists of a number of functions to help you work at the machine code level. The actual features included vary greatly, but a typical machine code monitor will allow you to enter and run machine code programs, inspect and modify memory contents in various ways, load and save machine code on tape, and will include various aids to debugging machine code programs. one memory location at a time you will often find that a machine code monitor will allow you to display a whole block of memory, either in hexadecimal or as the characters corresponding to the contents of the memory Another useful form of memory display that you will find in most machine code monitors is a disassembler. This converts the machine code in the computer's memory into assembly language mnemonics, and can be useful for debugging as it allows you to check that your program has been entered into the machine correctly. ONE STEP AT A TIME. Some machine code monitors include a trace or single step feature that allows you to run through a machine code program one instruction at a time, displaying the instruction and the contents of the registers. This can be very useful for debugging short programs or longer programs that you can enter very close to the point where you think the bug will be found. The usefulness of a trace by itself is limited because single stepping a machine code program is so much slower than the full speed of the microprocessor. Because of the information it has to display a trace routine can only work through a few instructions a second, while the microprocessor will normally run at a rate between two hundred thousand and one million instructions a second. Trace routines are quite common in monitors for 6502 microcomputers, particularly for the BBC Microcomputer, but are rarely found on Z80 and 6809 machines as the more extensive instruction sets on these microprocessors make it much more difficult to write a trace for them. Other functions you may find in machine code monitors include searching memory for numbers or strings of characters, moving blocks of memory, and relocating machine code programs to run at a different address. These can be useful but are less important than the basic memory inspect and modify and the breakpoint handler. ESSENTIAL FOR DEBUGGING ,,, The most essential debugging aid is a breakpoint handler. This allows you to specify an address where the execution of a machine code program will be stopped and control passed back to the machine code monitor. The monitor will display the contents of the microprocessor's registers when the breakpoint was reached, and some monitors will allow you to change the registers and continue running your machine code from the breakpoint. Breakpoints are a very powerful debugging aid, allowing you to work through your program checking the program flow and the contents of the registers at various points until you find out where the program is going wrong. SIMPLE MEMORY INSPECTION.,, The simplest type of memory inspection and modification function, is found in almost every machine code monitor to allow you to type in machine code programs. You begin by giving the address you want to start from and the monitor will display the contents of the address and allow you to type in a new value that will be placed in the address. You can then move on to the next address where the same thing happens. As well as this memory display that shows you the contents of BY TED BALL 150 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"MACHINE CODE YOU'LL NEED AN ASSEMBLER The second piece of software you will need is an assembler, and as with the machine code monitor you will probably need to buy one that has been designed for the computer you have. It is possible to assemble short programs by hand and use a machine code monitor to type in the hex object code but when the program gets to be longer than about 20 to 30 lines hand assembly is very tedious and prone to error and you really do need an assembler to convert the assembly language to object code and insert it into the computer's memory automatically. You will find a choice of assemblers available for most small microcomputers, and deciding which one to buy can be difficult. It is best to buy an assembler that is completely standard, or at least as close as you can find to the standard. Among the advantages of using the standard assembly language are that you can use the language in the form that you learn from books and magazine articles, you can use published program and subroutine listings without modification, and other people can use your listings. The manufacturers of assemblers for small home computers generally stress that their assemblers accept standard mnemonics, but there is more to an assembly language than just the opcode mnemonics You need to study the documentation before you buy, to check that you are getting a two pass assembler that allows you to use labels (preferably six-character labels) and forward references to labels, and also that the syntax for operands is standard and that you can include expressions in operands — addition and subtraction as an absolute minimum and preferably multiplication, division and logical operators as well. You should also check which number bases you can use in the assembler. Hexadecimal is the most important (although it is extra work to learn hexadecimal arithmetic at the beginning it makes things a lot easier later on) and binary and decimal are also important. Finally, the assembler you buy should include a range of pseudooperations or directives. These are instructions that you include in an assembly language source program, but they are instructions to the assembler and do not produce executable machine code. The minimum directives you should look for are for setting the area in memory that the machine code will be assembled to, assigning values to labels, reserving space within the machine code and for including data in the code. The data directives should allow you to give the data as one byte or two byte constants (as numbers or labels) and as characters or strings.
