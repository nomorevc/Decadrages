"NOW LET OFF SOME STEAM NEXT C&VG already leads the rest in its information on the video games scene, so for the latest news and the most trustworthy reviews test out our expanded Video Screens section next month. After all, the next generation of microcomputers may well burst out of this market. Vibra seats, holophonics and laser discs may still be MONTH what a little bit beyond Britain's arcades are currently capable of. But they are still ready to pull out a few surprises. Like Tip Top, a 3D version of Donkey Kong which sets an explorer down in the jungle, dodging 3D coconuts as he tries to get his own back on a mischevious ape. There's also a rundown of Buck Rogers, the futuristic space ace who has found his way into a video games cabinet and the right way to approach the World War II game Frontline. Plus arcade tips on new favourite Donkey Kong Junior. There's games in them thar pages of the July C&VG. Games enough for everyone as we are packing in an extra listings-only section. 32 pages packed with versions of popular games for all kinds of microcomputer on top of our normal selection of games programs. Spectrum owners are in for a bouncing climbing treat with both Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Junior putting in an appearance on their machine. Donkey Kong features the second screen of the arcade game with fires and ladders and Mario knocking the plugs out of the construction below Kong's feet. DK Junior features the vines, snap-jaws and fruits of this increasingly popular arcade game. Defend, Bug Battle, Spike Attack, Meteor, Draughts, Labyrinth and old favourites, like: Munchmen and Ninek's Invaders will be among the titles to take your mind off the forthcoming summer holidays. COMPUTER GAMES TOP TEN Sinclair Spectrum Atari 400/800 We've had a few unfortunate experiences with software but luckily in our privileged position we can vent off some steam through the C&VG Reviews pages. Up until now, you have not had the same opportunity to warn people about your own software disasters. Now, things are different. C&VG is going to give over a page or two each month to Great Software Disasters, which will be written by you, the readers. If you have bought a piece of software or a peripheral, or even a computer which you feel does not live up to its marketing blurb please write in and tell us. Reviews of bad software are just as important as reviews of good. And we strongly feel that the software houses which really do believe in quality rather than putting out any title which may make a killing in the short-term, should be supported. The only restriction we will put on this column is that the manufacturers will be allowed a right of reply before we publish. The first offering is a delightful rundown of one man's experiences with an Oric Computer. Keith Ollett is the man behind Aeiric Bloodaxe or How I Learnt to Live With an Oric. Not only does it tackle one man's struggle to adapt to a new micro but it does so in a way that had most C&VG staff stifling giggles and we also get the feeling that before too long Mr Ollett is going to form an undying affection for the new companion in his life. Read about Aeiric Bloodaxe next month and if it reminds you of some of your own experiences in the microcomputer market then write and let us know. It doesn't have to be as long as Mr Ollett's piece, just long enough to get your views across Hot on the heels of the Book of Video Games comes an exMONTT panded Video Screens section for C&VG's TV games centre readers. There is a whole host of new games cartridges plus a range of new machines, like the Vectrex and the Colecovision.

Dear Sir, I am keen to learn more about my Oric computer but do not know who to turn to as I am new to computing. Can you please advise me whether any groups or any other ogranisations for Oric users that I can turn to for help exist at the moment? Julian Douglas, Hartsholme, Lincoln Editor's reply: The Tangerine Users Group (TUG for short) is offering its services to Oric owners and the organisation can be contacted at: 1, Marlborough Drive, Worle, Avon BS22 ODQ. But Bob Green of TUG tells me he is currently overwhelmed with response from Oric owners and delays of 14 days before the organisation can get back to enquirers, are inevitable. Dear Sir, A friend of mine consulted me about a game program from your magazine for the Pet called Krazy Kong (February 1983 issue) as it would not work. Apart from typing errors, the main cause was that it was written for a 9 inch screen Pet and used a PEEK to find the value of key pressed (PEEK 151). Unfortunately, 12inch screen 4000 series Pets give different values to the earlier small screen, a fact not widely known. To convert the program to be universal (on all except the Basic 2 version machines) it is necessary to change the following lines in the program. Line 20: Replace with lines 15 to 25 Line 170 to 240: Change variable S to SI Lines 1050 to 1090: To use variables Z1, Z2, Z3 & 24 Lines 1220 and 1230: Change variable S to Si Dear Sir, There are two reasons why readers may have difficulty in getting Rockfall printed in your March 1983 issue, to work. First, the printer used to obtain the listing appears to have a different character set to the one on the BBC. This, of course, has the effect that certain BBC characters are replaced by certain non-BBC characters on the listing. This effect occurs on the following lines: LINE 10,\"1\" SHOULD BE \"T\" (WHICH IS DISPLAYED AS \"-\" IN MODE 7) LINE 10,\" SHOULD BE \" IN MODE 7) LINE 60,\"_\" SHOULD BE \"T\" (\"\" IN MODE 7) Secondly, the program does not work on an Operating System 1.2 machine due to the method COLOURFUL SKYSCRAPER 1000 IF SP + 32 479 then BD = 0:POKE SP + 1024,128: RETURN ELSE IF PEEK (SP+32+1024)=175 THEN POKE SP + 32 + 1024, 128: ........

Having loaded myself up with miscellaneous objects I try the key in all the prison cell doors — it doesn't fit any of them. (You have to kick the barred window to get out.)

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPETI SCORES START BE A CHAMP TO MOUNT The high arcade scores of would be champions are beginning to mount in the Computer & Video Games office. A whole host of machines are proving their popularity but few clear leaders have so far emerged. Many players have stayed with tried and true favourites which have been languishing in arcades for years while others proudly sign their name beside the latest games on the market. Asteroids, Pacman and Scramble feature among the older games still finding favour with video gamers. James Thomas of Fishguard has taken an early lead with his signed Scramble score of 3,672,820 from the Cleddau Leisure Centre in Haverford West. But the rest of the Scramble scores are languishing well behind Jonathan Rees must be suffering from a bad case of Pacman finger A brand spanking new arcade game, not previously released in the UK is still to be claimed from Taitel Electronics The prize will go to our 1983 Video Games Champion when he has seen off all opposition at the grand final on July 7th. To qualify for that final, simply cut out the form below and take it down to your local pub or arcade or wherever your favourite machines can be found. Put up the best score you can on when you reach a score you're happy with, ask the arcade or pub manager to sign the form to witness it.

Another two million plus score was notched up by Andrew Freeman of Pitsea Pool in Basildon on Asteroids. Donkey Kong and Robotron are among the games being battled over by other arcade veterans. Some 569,000 from Mark Neale was witnessed in the Boscombe Pier Amusements on Donkey Kong while current top Robotron ace is R. Cooper whose score of over nine million stirred the locals in the DeLuxe arcade in Hastings.

For all you T.I. 99-ers who couldn't pass our colour blindness test on Ski-ing in May, I've got to warn you about the perils of snow glare. Any irate phonecall or a letter to the offices of C&VG will result in a HELP BUYERS MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE AAR best advantage. Making the best use of the colour graphics and sound facilities of the machine. The best of the programs will hopefully feature in future Dixons store demonstrations, helping to entice people to buy Atari computers. There will also be three runnersup prizes of the latest Atari software. Judging will commence on June 16th and we'll need your entries in by then. My own view of in-store displays of microcomputers is that they era on the side of the technical and verbose, instead of getting down to demonstrating some hot game action. But, luckily, it is being judged by Dixons' and Atari's experts, so you'll have a free reign to produce the best display for all kinds of computer usage. The competition is not open to employees of EMAP, Dixons or Atari or their relatives and the judges' decision will, of course, be final. SEVENTH CHANCE TO ENTER When you bought your computer did you go for the one with the impressive pattern display or the one conducting its own sales patter. Well, Atari is giving you a chance to influence the way its computer is represented in the future. In conjunction with the high street electronics chain of Dixons and ourselves, Atari is setting up a competition to get your ideas on how its computers can best be presented to the perusing public. Dixons provides a good example of how high street stores have taken home computers to their hearts. The Dixons shelves are now packed with many different brands battling for attention and giving buyers a chance to run their hands over a host of different keyboards. But trying out a quick loop can hardly be a buyer's benchtest. He should see the micro running at its best before he makes his judgement. Obviously Atari are confident about their machine but how would you show it in its best light? An Atari 800 microcomputer goes to the winner, or — if you already own an Atari — you can opt for a disc drive and an equivalent value in Atari software as a prize. To enter the competition, simply write a program in Atari Basic which sets the computer off to the but fill in the form below and we will do our best to include you. Please include me in the Seventh Empire game when it resumes. I would like to name my tribe the The reappearance of The Seventh Empire has been met with roars of approval from the players and groans of horror from the poor devils who are tied to the Empire computer while it decides the fate of the galaxy. But with a Colecovision as the star prize in the game, we couldn't let the game suffer its demise for too long. So it will soon be making a triumphant return allowing a fresh start to all those who may have lost a fleet. We can now replace players who have had to drop out of the game for one reason or another. So if you have been disappointed in the past, not to be playing Seventh Empire, then we are offering another chance. First come, first served I'm afraid My name is: Address: ...

"BACK ISSUES 32 THE EVOLUTION OF COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES (PART 1) Most computer historians agree that the first known remains of Computer & Video Games date from November 1981. It was then that this magazine first emerged a little unsteadily) into the primeval twilight of the early days of Sinclair Man. Then huge computer dinosaurs roamed the Earth, thrusting keen young programmers into their wall-to-wall maws and the magazine looked a little out-of-place surviving on a diet of strange new features and listing material washed up from across the Atlantic. Naturalists are only now beginning to draw conclusions about the close association between the Computer & Video Games story and a little yellow gobbling creature's own evolutionary niche... Let us take a closer look at some of the noteworthy steps in the evolution of both:November 1981 The stripling emerges into twilight with Tarot on the Tandy, Musical Hangman on the Sharp MZ-BOK, Trench on the Atari, Nibblers on the Pet and Super Nim on the Apple. Keith Campbell kicked off his popular Adventure series, Garry Marshall kicked off graphics with a space invader. There were Pacman arcade tips and Max Bramer looked at the first chess machine, Von Kempelen's Turk. December 1981 Growing up fast with Potshot on the Vic-20, Breakout on the Atom, 'Round the Horn' on the Tandy, Mini Golf on the Atari and Pet owners could tackle Rubik's Cube with more confidence. Keith Mott went trouble-shooting on the ZX81 in Kit Korner and Screaming Foul-up fell in love with Terry Wogan. January 1982 A new year begins with Ted Ball on the trail of the Bugs in his Practical Programming column. Speed Race for the Texas, Treasure Hunt was a popular Apple adventure much converted by owners of other machines, three IK wonders for the ZX81 and Changing Hearts for Atari owners. We also saw a seamier side to gaming with a feature on Softporn Adventure! February 1982 Science Fiction author David Langford brought a new look to space games with Space Blockade. Dr Livingstone set up a quest for Sharp owners and Grand Prix gave Tandy owners a racetrack to try out. David Annal POKEd some sounds out of the quieter micros and Arcade Action announced two Pacman lookalikes. March 1982 Robin Bradbeer reported from Las Vegas on a country going video crazy how right he was. ZX81 owners got to grips with Reversi (Othello), there was Startrek III.4 for the Tandy and Octodraw had the Atari moving in eight directions at once. April 1982 Spring came with Tim Metcalfe's feature on pinball, a revitalised sector of the arcades fighting back against Space Invaders. Engineer helped Atari owners rebuild the Golden Gate Bridge, Poker for the ZX81 and Ron Potkin's classic Tandy wargame Kriegspiel. Plus Pacman hit the home Video Screens at last. May 1982 Computer Moderated Games were investigated by Terry Pratt (the first thoughts on Seventh Empire were voiced about here). Minotaur took the Vic-20 down into a maze and tried to lose it, Pacman arrived in a C&VG listing on a Pet, Minopoly for up to five Sharp businessmen, Meteorstorm took Apple owners by surprise and Earthport II won Tandy fans. June 1982 The World Cup was upon us and we responded with World Cup Manager written for the Sharp but without a PEEK or POKE and since converted to many a micro. Vic-20 owners were set afloat on a river torrent in Speedboat, there was Trolls Gold on the Apple and Dog Star Adventure on the Tandy It also included issue 1 of our BBC Micro publication, Owl. July 1982 Do the arcades have anything to offer the fairer sex? America was wooing women with Ms Pacman and we featured this first lady of the arcades in July. Imhotep took the Apple owners back to ancient Egypt, Moon Shuttle sent the Vic into space and Z-Xtra gave 16 pages over to Sinclair lans. August 1982 Haunted House gave Atoms a shudder, Space Hopper made Tandy's jump to it and Rocks made Vic owners roll over and beg for more. Imagic launched a range of cartridges for the Atari VCS. Hardcore was given over to a game-player's guide to the Atan and Sue Garden gave us all a giggle with a computer widow's tale. September 1982 Tron: out of the arcades came Walt Disney's graphically stirring film about being trapped in a computer game. We featured it first. Pacman appeared on the Vic-20, there was Star Wars on the Atom and Colditz Adventure on the Tandy. Issue two of Owl gave BBC owners Speed Trial and X marks the Spot. October 1982 C&VG saw out its first 12 issues with Space Watch on the Spectrum, asking you to befriend the aliens before it's too late! Sharp Defender, Galaxian Colony II on the Apple and the controversial Wild Strawberries on the Atari added to the action. And Pacman appeared in the Bugs cartoon!

PREPARING THE PROGRAM 1. Type in the program below and save it on a new tape i.e. CSAVE \"DRAGCONV\" 2. Now type \"RUN\". The program will build up the machine language program. 3. There are two checks to ensure that the DATA has been entered correctly. If the number of items is not 316 or they do not sum to 36454, an error message will be printed. If this occurs inspect the DATA very carefully. 4. If the program passes the tests, you will be asked to get the cassette recorder ready. Put a second new tape into the recorder and press the RECORD and PLAY. Press ENTER when ready. Don't use the same tape things can get very difficult if you want to erase one program and not the other. 5. The converter will save in machine format. The name of the program is \"DRAGON\". Four copies are saved. OPERATION 1. Switch on the Dragon and type \"CLEAR 200,31999\". This will keep the routine safe. 2. Rewind the tape containing the machine program and load it i.e. CLOADM \"DRAGON\". 3. Now load the TRS-80 program written in Basic. 4. Type \"EXEC 32115\". 5. The program will print out line numbers of any USR's. 6. When conversion is complete, LIST the program. It should now make sense. 7. CSAVE the converted program on a new tape. 8. Do not RUN it if you have further programs to convert since programs using protected memory are liable to ruin the converter. 9. Check the programs and the USR's once all conversions are complete. By the way, the program does not work in reverse! You cannot convert a Dragon program back to the TRS-80. illustration: Dorian Cross COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 29 "

"AND RUNS ON A BBC MODEL A OR B IN 16K BY STEVE HEAP This is an interesting variation of those very early bat and ball type video games which heralded the arcade boom all those years ago. It was written primarily for the BBC Model B but can easily be converted to work on the A or B from the keyboard. The object of the game is to trap a bouncing ball in a coloured rectangle in the top corner of the screen. To do this a continuous line is drawn using the joystick (or keyboard controls) which slowly confines the ball in a smaller and smaller area until it is finally trapped. But beware the ball has a nasty habit of escaping through the smallest gap in your defences! If you are successful and manage to catch the bouncing ball the time you take will be displayed — together with the best time so far. The fire button on the joystick sets up a new game at any time. The game can be converted to work from the keyboard by changing/adding the following lines: 25 ON ERROR GOTO 650 62 *FX12,1 64 *FX11,1 66 *FXIS, 180 IF INKEY$( \"N\" GOTO 66 ELSE GOTO 149 190 IF INKEY( \"N\" GOTO 66 ELSE GOTO 190 345 A$TNKEY() 350 IF A$\"Z\" IF AX20 THEN AZAZ-DA%: GOTO 39 360 IF A$\"X\" IF AX< 1260 THEN AX-A%DA%: GOTO 390 370 IF A$ : IF UZ< 1000 THEN UZU%DUZ: GOTO 390 389 IF A$ / IF U >20 THEN UX-UX DUX 395 *FX15, 650 *FXIS, 660 XFX12, 67 MODE 7: END illustration: Terry Rogers COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 45 "

"PROTECTOR BY L. BRAINE RUNS ON A VIC-20 IN 3.5K Space piracy is ruining the economy of your sector of the galaxy and Star Fleet Command have ordered you, the skipper of an interstellar customs cruiser, to wipe out the pirates at any cost. Their plundering means that galactic taxes may have to put up and there's an interplanetary election coming up! Blasting off from your HQ after picking up your orders you soon pick up the space pirates fleet on your scanners. They are approaching you in force and closing fast. The odds are six to one. Your only chance is to quickly switch to hex-drive, which will give you two minutes of super-power and enable you to out manoeuvre the pirate ships and blast them out of the sky. Can you end the pirates reign of terror? Your score will be shown at the top of the screen, and also the time you have left to complete your task. The high score is also shown. The program is listed in two parts. First the userdefined graphics and second is the main program.

"THE MEN WHO INVENTED ME WERE CLEVER ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK IN FORTH (IT'S 10 TIMES FASTER AND 4 TIMES MORE COMPACT THAN BASIC'). YET THEY'RE DUMB ENOUGH TO SELL ME FOR .95!. Jupiter ACE B Richard Altwasser and Steven Vickers are the men who invented the Jupiter Ace After years of designing microcomputers that use BASIC (both men played a major role in creating the ZX Spectrum), they abandoned it in favour of FORTH FORTH is just as easy to learn as BASIC. Yet it's a faster, more compact and more structured language that educationalists and professional programmers alike prefer So the Jupiter Ace is the only microcomputer you can buy that is designed around FORTH Using it, there's little fear of accidentally 'crashing programs halfway through and having to start all over again (a common fault with BASIC). The Jupiter Ace's comprehensive error checking sees to that The Jupiter Ace has a full-size keyboard, high resolution graphics, sound, floating point arithmetic, a fast, reliable cassette interface, 3K of RAM and a full 12 month warranty You get all that for .95. Plus a mains adaptor, all the leads needed to connect most cassette recorders and TV's, a software catalogue (35 cassettes available, soon to be 50). the Jupiter Ace manual and a free demonstration cassette of 5 programs The Jupiter Ace manual is a complete introduction to personal computing and a simple-to-follow course in FORTH, from first principles to confident programming Plug-on 16K and 48K memory expansions are also available, at very competitive prices (There'll be a plug-on printer interface available soon, too.) It'll take you no time at all to realise how clever Richard and Steven were to design the Jupiter Ace around FORTH. And even less time to realise whata silly price .95 is to charge for it.

"You can't escape the coils of this snake as it writhes around your Oric and charms even the most world weary gaines player. If you've played the arcade game Centipede or some similar game you'll know just what this is all about If not this is what you'll see. Your slippery Oric snake has to be steered around the screen with the cursor keys, gobbling up numbers which appear at random. Each time you hit a number the length of the snake increases in proportion to the size of that number-say if you eat a 5 you'll get five extra coils, and so on. Unfortunately your snake exists in a very confined space and the more he eats the bigger hel gets and the less space there is to move around -and if he crosses his own path or bites his tail then the game is all over! Oh yes, just to make things a little more interesting the screen border is definitely no place for a snake to stray. If you hit it you are dead! This is an addictive little game which you'll be playing again and again just to get the elusive high score.

"Holy Moses! God has sure given me a tough task this time. I was sitting minding my own business, thinking holy thoughts, when there was this great clap of thunder, a flash of lightning, and this voice that filled my head until I thought it was going to burst! The voice said, \"I God, instruct you Moses to lead the Israelites away from Egypt to the Promised Land. But beware as the Pharoah will persue you with his armies and attempt to make you slaves again. Take the road towards the Red Sea and freedom. I will help you provided no more than 2000 Israelites die on the journey. I have one miracle that I can use to aid your escape but you must reach the Red Sea first. The Promised Land lies on the other side of this sea which you must cross. Then you must take the Israelites to the place of the tablets, on which are engraved the Ten Commandments. Here you will be safe from the Egyptians and any other dangers.\" So that's why we are trudging across these parched lands towards our Promised Land — with the Egyptian Pharoah's armies hot on our heels. 7 GRAPHICS 1: SEICOLOR 2,0,0 8 POSITION , 10:? #6; \"the ten commandmen RUNS ON AN ATARI 400/800 IN 5K ts\" BY MARK BELL 9 FOR EE-10 TO 10 10 SOUND 0, 200, 4, 10 ABS (E) 11 SOUND 1,255, 4, 10-ABS (E) 12 SOUND 2,225,4,10-ABS (E) 13 SOUND 3, 150, 4, 10-ABS (E) 14 FOR K=1 TO 200: NEXT K: NEXT E: SOUND 0,0,0SOUND 1,0,0,0: SOUND 2,0,0,0: SOUND , 3,0,0, 15 DIM A$ (38) 17 GOTO 100 18 FOR F=1 TO INT (19*RND (0) ) +1: READ A$:N EXT F: RETURN 20 C=SOR (Q)*5 21 IF Q=1 THEN C=INT (Q+Q) CINT (1@*RND CO )))) 22 IF 021 AND Q< =2 THEN C=INT (O*Q) (INT (1@*RND (O)))) 23 IF QX2 AND Q<=3 THEN CEINT((Q*Q) (INT (10*RND (O)))) 24 IF Q>3 AND Q<=4 THEN C=INT (50*RND (0) ) +Q+2) 25 IF 0>4 AND Q<=5 THEN CEINT((65*RND (0) ) +Q*2) 26 IF 0>5 THEN C=INT (199*RND (0))+0*2) 27 RETURN 30 GRAPHICS : POKE 752.1: SETCOLOR 2.0.0: FOR E=1 TO B:PRINT : NEXT E:PRINT \" Thou has failed me Moses...I saideth\" 31 PRINT to You not more than 2000 ped ple\":PRINT \" should die...\"; D+L;\" peopl e have died.\" 32 FOR E=1 TO 1550: NEXT E:PRINT \"...and so shall You.\":FOR E=1 TO 999: NEXT E:GO TO 830 33 GRAPHICS : SETCOLOR 2,9,: POKE 752,1: W FOR E=1 TO 10: PRINT : NEXT E:PRINT ould thou care to try again ?\" (Yay or Nay) : POKE 34 PRINT 764,255 35 IF PEEK (764)=255 THEN 35 36 IF PEEK (764)=35 THEN PRINT : PRINT\" THANKS FOR THE GAME.\":POKE 764,25 5: POKE 752,0: END 37 POKE 764, 255: RUN 90 PRINT\" The people are unhappy becaus e they\":PRINT \"are hungry and fear deat hor sickness.\": RETURN 98 D= (D+L): IF D+L>2000 THEN 30 99 RETURN 100 I=INT (34000*RND (1) ) + 9000 101 G=INT (9000*RND (1) ) +2000 "

You arrive at Ascot at the start of the day's racing with just  in your pocket and a burning desire to win at least ,000. It is possible to win ,000 plus but that isn't easy! Before each race you are given a list of runners and their odds. The odds are a realistic representation of the chances of winning but there are no dead certs and the favourite doesn't always win. In a large field a long odds outsider might come romping home. Program notes: Line 150 decides how many runners in the race and resets Z to the screen address of the starting position of the first runner. Line 210 selects the odds. Lines 220, 230 reduce the odds to the lowest denominator Line 250 handicaps the horse according to its odds. 530-580, the race is run between these lines. The Peek in 550 checks if a horse has finished. POKE 4466, X print X lines down. POKE 4465, Y-print Y columns in. Om Illustration: Dorian Cross Mera Ve l U NAVEL "

The enemy is determined to destroy your fuel supplies and only you and commander of two battle-towers which defend a blasted plateau which serves as a fuel-supply depot for your armed forces can protect the valuable stockpile. Will you be able to beat off the alien attack? Or will the invaders destroy you and your planet? Once you have programmed in this life and death struggle you will see two towers appear on the screen. The '+' signs at the bottom of the screen mark the locations of the fuel supplies which you have to protect. There are three cannons in each of the towers which remain hidden until fired at the advancing aliens. The laser blast from each cannon will reach halfway across the screen. To make the game harder you have limited power for your cannons. If you find they do not fire you must wait a few seconds for them to recharge. but will Also the aliens can destroy your weapons not be harmed themselves. They can only be destroyed by a direct hit or a collision with one of the towers. Once two fuel-dumps are destroyed by the invaders the game is over.

This is a challenging game of deduction in the Mastermind mode. Your Spectrum will create a code which you have to crack. The code takes the shape of four pegs hidden in an eight by eight grid the \"black box\". You have to attempt to crack the code by sending in \"rays\" from the edges of the box. These rays always travel in a straight line unless they hit a peg. When this happens you'll get a clue to the wherabouts of the hidden pegs. The rays behave in a completely logical fashion. When they strike a peg the ray will either be absorbed, deflected at right angles or reflected back the way it came. From the actions of the rays you will be able to deduce the positions of the pegs. But beware some rays will follow long and tortuous routes which can be baffling! When the game begins you are in normal mode, where you fire rays in from the outside edges of the box. When you think you know the location of any, or all, the pegs, type 0 and you will enter cursor mode. Using the controls listed on the screen you plot the pegs which you think you have found. When you reckon that you know the positions of all the pegs type in 9 (in cursor mode) and the computer will mark your final guess. Because of the limitations of Basic the computer will sometimes take several seconds to work out a ray path. For those of you with stiff programming fingers the title pages at the end of the listing can be left out. You must however, leave in the lines which read the user-defined graphic characters. Remember that when typing in these user-defined graphic the characters will simply be letters in graphics mode I used A, B, C, and D. 0000 000 HEN LET direct=p+1 6.

"The deadly Death Star is threatening your peaceful planet with absolute destruction. Soon it will be close enough to unlease the deadly power of its Ultimate Weapon which will wipe your home star off the face of the universe. Your only chance is to attack before the Star gets close enough to blast the planet. Your best space fighter pilots have been briefed about this mission. They know they may not return. They must attack the Death Star's most vulnerable spot which can only be reached by flying down a narrow \"trench\" on the star's vast superstructure. The trench will be protected by fast Tie fighters, flown by the Imperial Alliance's most accomplished pilots, and there are laser cannons positioned in and around the trench itself. You join the action just as the rebel fighters are zapping down in to the trench to do battle with the Imperial forces. Your ship is protected by an energy shield which is depleted each time an enemy cannon scores a hit on your craft. You have to travel along the trench shooting down enemy fighters and when the radio-active waste exhaust chute opening appears you must score a direct hit on it to restore your shields and if destroy the deadly Death Star. You must shoot down all your attackers too you simply dodge one he'll be back to blast you out of the skies when you least expect it. So stand by for action and watch out for the Imperial fleet! 20 Rete 12 R15 13 F1 F20 F30 F4 19 GOTO 3e 48 CL 53 5 GOTO 228 6 PLRY\"125505004605C\" IF PPOINTCX-10,Y)=4 THEN GOTO 70 ELSE GUTO180 THEN GOTU 180 @ IF S 88 IF R2=R1+5 THEN GOTO 180 90 IF Z105 THEN R2-R1 RI-R15 Se 1 RESER1 GOTO 178 100 IF F-1 THEN SC-SC 100 110 IF F 2 THEN SC-5C+75 120 IF F-3 THEN SC-SC+50 120 R -1 130 IF F-4 THEN SC-SC-25 248 FE PUT(C1.81 )-(C1+26, B1+14),F3. 158 PLAYO1T25AGAGRAGAGRGR 1.

"MADVENTURES Minilib MIND OVER MATTER... Now that my series of programming tips has been concluded, I shall be devoting a corner to hints on solving some of the more difficult problems that are stumping Adventure-playing readers. These will be printed upside down, so as not to catch the eyes of those wishing to battle on! Readers often write to me requesting help but unfortunately, although I have played many Adventures, I have not solved them all! So help me to help fellow Adventurers by writing to me with object that precedes the required one in the inventory list, using it, and then picking up the discarded ones. This task isn't aided by the rather slow response time. Whilst the reply is screened quickly enough, the prompt sometimes takes a long time to appear, and a fast player can easily lose all or part of his next command without realising it. A large colourful box, complete with internal plastic moulding housed Empire of the Overmind. Also included was a double page of detailed, well printed instructions on how to load and save the game on a 48k Apple, 48k TRS-80, and 40k Atari 800. This was quite important, as the methods although simple were not obvious. Also in the package was \"Rhyme of the Overmind', a long and rather well-written poem printed in script on pale blue parchment-like paper. This covered a number of pages held together with a silken cord emellished with-yes! a tassel! Oh, I nearly forgot! The box also contained a cassette containing all three versions of the game. It is available from Avalon Hill Games of 650 High Road, North Finchley, London N12 ONIL for .95 on cassette, .95 on disc. tips. At the moment David Coverley and Anthony Sanford are languishing in Artic's 'Ship of Doom', unable to set the key from under the glass. Steven Milligan, meanwhile, hasn't cracked the secret of Artic's 'Espionage Island'. Can you help me help them, and save them from otherwise certain insanity? The same is screened graphically in colour and bats, which are a hazard, can be seen flapping around. Sufficient must be killed to enable you to move up a level. How do you kill the bats to get to Dracula? Would you believe with a laser gun? This might be a reasonable maze game, but good Adventure it is not. From Richard Shepherd Software, this is disappointing after Shaken not Stirred. For .50 you will get the game on a TDK cassette, and a fairly comprehensive two-page description of how to load and play the game. \"I am Overmind; Ruler of mortals, destroyer of worlds! Know me, obey me, and despair!\" With terror in your heart, you wish Overmind dead. But Overmind is omniscient, knowing even your innermost thoughts, and inflicts upon you the pain of a thousand lashes. Before you start playing Empire of the Overmind it is almost essential to read the Rhyme of the Overmind, supplied with the game. On starting, you find yourself among mountains and brooks, where tracks and trails abound, and ever present in the sky is a large red planet. A mysterious stone tower appears to hold no secrets other than an animated skeleton who clobbers you as soon as you take the key which hopefully will unlock an iron door. Unconscious, your body is moved. You will more than likely end up in a very dark place. I did many times, and despaired. But the game imparts such a feeling of intense hatred toward Overmind, that I was determined not to be beaten. Thus, I came to a place where there was a large blue planet in the sky. I haven't yet defeated Overmind but I shall return to fight again! At first the game appears insoluble due to the difficulty of getting out of the \"very dark place\". However, and this may help the disheartened player, when \"clobbered\" unconscious, you don't always end up in \"a very dark place\". I'll say no more than that! Another problem is that it appears a held object cannot be used (although it may be dropped) unless it heads the inventory list. Whether or not this feature is deliberate is hard to say, but it involves the rather tedious task of dropping every What's in a package? How much are you tempted by a large attractive box in a plastic bubble, covered with a design suggesting fantasy and excitement with Do you ever suspect that you may have had to pay a few pounds less had that same cassette been more plainly wrapped? The ultimate test, of course, is in the invisible magnetic impressions on that cassette. Here we have two games. One is lavishly packaged in a beautifully illustrated box, and quite expensive; the other supplied on a proprietary cassette with a duplicated instruction sheet, and at the low end of the price spectrum. No pun intended! Transylvanian Tower is billed as a 'spine-chilling new Adventure for the 48k Spectrum. Unfortunately it is not There are five levels in the tower, and the player's objective is to reach the top. kill Count Dracula, and raid his treasure trove. Each level consists of a maze, and each has different characteristics. A floor plan of the level can be called up, with increasing difficulty as one nears the top. Objects, many of which have magical properties, may be picked up if seen by typing \"P\", but only three may be carried simultaneously. ADVENTURE TIPS Howdy! The stage arrived last week bringing cries of help from a number of would-be cowboys in Ghost Town. There they are, standing next to a pesky horse, and quite unable to get the darned critter movin'. Now then folks, don't go getting no fancy ideas that I'm gonna give away all my ol' pal Scott's secrets. Leastwise, not unless you take me down to that there saloon and fetch me something a mite stronger than what's in your Golden Derringer. Nope just a few hints to chew over until you get right inspired, that's all you'll get out of me!

"overlook the checkmate. Against an opponent who played 34. Q-R8ch in full knowledge of all the variations that could follow, it makes little difference what Black plays, the best course of action probably being to resign, but what if White had played the check in ignorance, simply as an \"irritant\" to Black? What if White were a weak player and Black a Grandmaster (an unlikely event admittedly, but quite possible in a simultaneous tournament or in a material odds game?). STAYING ALIVE Would it be better to move the King and rely on White not following up properly (as well as the checkmate there is the strong reply 35. R-B8, of course) or to give up the Rook to guarantee staying \"alive\" THE DUCHESS AND KAISSA I left you with a celebrated position (figure 1) from the first round game between Duchess and Kaissa, at that time the reigning world champion program, at the second world computer chess championship in Toronto in 1977. In the diagrammed position, Duchess (White) had just played 34. Q-R8ch, a check which can be parried by a King move to N2. However, Kaissa's next move astounded the entire audience, which included former world (human) champion Mikhail Botvinnik and other strong masters, plus the team of expert commentators. It played 34. ... R-K1, placing the Rook en prise. After Duchess' 35. QxRch, Kaissa lost quickly. The task for Kaissa's programmers before the next round was to find out what caused the program to commit such a gross blunder and correct the fault. Only later was it realised that Kaissa's 34th move was not a blunder at all. If instead Black had played 34. ... K-N2, White could give checkmate by the Queen sacrifice 35. Q-B8ch! followed, after 35... . KxQ by 36. B-R6ch. Whether Black now were to play 36. . . . B-N2 or 36. ... K-N1, 37. R-B8ch would be checkmate (apart from irrelevant sacrifices by Black to delay the end by a move or two). Kaissa's evaluation function clearly ranked losing a Rook as preferable to being checkmated, which solves the mystery. However, the question remains: is 34. ... R-Kl a blunder or a brilliancy? In particular it would be a mistake for the best analyst (BELLE at present) to assume all its opponents were equally good. There is a well-known joke about an ultra-intelligent chess playing program considering its first move in a game, as White. After hours of analysis it decides that the opening position is, after all, a forced win for Black in every variation Rather than waste any more time defending a hopeless position, it immediately resigns without playing a move! The flaw in the argument is, of course, that chess is a contest where the opponent's fallibility plays a crucial part. So, how would Kaissa have made its decision? From a competitive viewpoint, it should have taken the strength of its opponent into account. No doubt Duchess was strong enough to win when a Rook ahead, but would its analysis algorithm have caused it to consider the Queen sacrifice? If it did, would it have been able to look far enough ahead to discover the checkmate? In more subtle ways, judgements about the skill level of the opponent are an important part of human play. Grandmasters prepare specially for their major opponents by studying their games and playing style, and looking for weaknesses. It is interesting to speculate whether chess-playing programs of the future will include representations of their main rivals' algorithms in a similar way. a b c d e f g h ROOK DILEMMA and then hope somehow to win even though a Rook behind in material? The problem becomes more difficult if the details are changed a little: what if Black were already a Bishop ahead or if the checkmate were 10 moves (each side) deep, or both? Considerations of this kind are far from irrelevant in computer play, where programs can often vary considerably in analytic powers, and where a program will frequently be \"blind\" to a strong move which human experts perceive easily. It would be completely wrong to assume that all computer chess programs are deep or infallible analysts (although some are extremely good). It is surprisingly difficult to answer this with confidence. Objectively, losing a Rook must be preferable, but it could be argued that losing the Rook is only slightly less fatal, does not postpone checkmate very long, and moreover even the humblest beginner would capture the Rook, whereas even quite a good player might just conceivably BY MAX BRAMER "

When a piece is found that has opponents within range, a letter will be placed to the right of each defender. There are two types of combat: 1. ATTACKING AT ONE HEX RANGE This is compulsory. If there is only one defender the attack takes place automatically. If there is more than one, the piece will flicker \"WHO\", to which you must reply with one of the letters appear ing on the screen. The result of the attack will appear at the bottom of the screen. Tomahawks may only attack at one hex range. 2. ATTACKING AT TWO OR THREE HEX RANGE This is optional. If you do not wish to attack, press \"ENTER\" DEFENCE A defender is permitted to return the fire once during the attack sequence.

"he movement routine is complete. Now we must approach the much more difficult part of the program which takes care of the combat. This occurs immediately the player has completed all moves. This article is devoted entirely to machine language routines. Next we will develop and complete the Basic portion so that you will see how they fit together. The combat sequence involves examining up to 30 hex around each man looking for opponents. A diagram of this area is shown in figure 1. You will see that I have divided it up into 6 segments and labelled the hex in each A, B, C, D, E and F. There are, of course, really 36 hex but because the hex is elongated due to the shape of the video pixel, one finds that a distance of three hex North or South is unrealistically far, so the top and bottom hex are ignored. If you want to have them, the adjustment is easy. At this point, we must get into some heavy machine code. In order to make an attack, we need to know several facts about the opponent i.e. 1. His position on the screen. (2 bytes) 2. The position of boulders which provide cover. (2 bytes) 3. The distance between the two pieces. 4. The index of the defend 5. The direction of the attack When we come out of the IC routine we will have this information in a table called TB. The first byte in this will Illustration: John Davis No wargame is complete without a good battle. In part six of his Warpath game, Ron Potkin tackles the combat routines as the cavalry and the braves move to adjacent hexes. contain the length which we divide by seven to obtain the number of defenders. The code in X$(16) calls five subroutines held in X$(10) through to X$(14). Some of these are very simple and I could have repeated the coding in the X$(16), but the length would have exceeded the maximum which can be held in one string. Incidentally, this routine was first written and tested in Basic and then translated. For example: X$(12)...C = C+1 IF C = 7 THEN C = 1 RETURN X$(13)...C = C-1 IF C = 0 THEN C = 6 RETURN I prefer this method. The idea is that I can get the logic correct in Basic so that, when writing the machine code, I need only concentrate on the syntax. It looks complicated because machine code requires that you work at a much greater level of detail. Let me outline what happens: 1. Register BC counts the number of segments i.e. 6 (see lines 300-500 of RANGE). This is also the direction indicator. Assume that BC equals l. 2. Register D contains l if we are checking a near boulder hex (A). Register E contains 1 if it is a far hex (B or D). These will be stored in the table if a boulder is found. 3. The routine TEST uses BC to obtain the offset. This gets us to A. It calculates the IBOARD and VIDEO positions as it proceeds. If there is a defender here, we need to look no further because the attack is compulsory. 4. Now we continue up to hex B and C using the same offset. Any defenders are saved in TB. We now go back to the start (using INIT). We call TEST which takes us to A and then increment C and call TEST again which takes us to D. Similar methods are used to reach E and Just one point: the routines use the same names as the Basic program. This was necessary in order to stop my head going in circles! Do not confuse the two. The six subroutines are in this month's listing. As usual, load the tape containing Parts 1 to 5 before you start. Sorry: there are several lines of numbers — so take it easy. Type in a few lines at a time and save at regular intervals. You will see that I have adjusted lines 4000 to 4020 which will check that the DATA is correct. Make sure that the X$ strings are the following lengths: X$( 10 11 12 13 14 16 Length 17 46 9 10 128 220 Once you have RUN this program, delete lines 791, 1085/6 and all lines from 2000 upwards. The only code remaining should be up to 1690 in multiples of 10. Now save this as well. You will be pleased to know that this completes all machine code -the remainder is now in Basic COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 87 "

"GRAPHICS By Garry Marshall NOW COMPUTERS CAN \"SEE\" Most modern day robots look nothing like those science-fiction monsters all metal and malevolence. Our conception of a robot is of a deaf and blind slave but it is possible for robots to \"see\". They use this accomplishment to move around in their environments and to assemble the parts making up fairly complex items. A computer \"sees\" in exactly the same way that it does everything else The labelling can then be done by a program, and once the labelling is done, the shape of the object can be understood. The key to doing the labelling automatically is in the way that the corners where edges meet can be labelled. The corners marked A and B in figure 1, for example, both show three converging edges all of which are labelled with '+, so that they are projecting outwards to form a corner of the kind possessed by a cube. In fact, there are 18 permitted ways for labelled edges to converge at a corner. They are all illustrated in figure 2. All other possible corner labellings correspond to situations that are physically impossible. With the aid of this list of valid corner labellings, we can give a method for the automatic labelling of a line drawing. It FIG 1: LABELLINGS L L L  4 YYY IT TTT 1. Label the perimeter of the drawing with arrows forming a clockwise ring. 2. Complete the corners on the outside with corner labellings selected from figure 2. 3. Work inwards to label the remaining corners with valid labellings until the labelling is complete. These three phases are illustrate in figure 3. Step 3 required two passes in FIG 2: CORNER LABELLINGS FIG 3: THE THREE PHASES join of two surfaces. Such lines are indicated by representing them with a by running a program. In this case it must be presented in some way with an image of what it is seeing and run a program which can tell it what this image means. The image can be presented by a video camera. However, it is a task beyond the current state of the art to interpret raw video pictures directly. If such pictures are first processed to reduce them to line drawings, then it is a quite straightforward matter to interpret them. In this article I'll explain how line drawings of three-dimensional objects can be interpreted so that a computer can be programmed to know what it is seeing. Next I will examine how ordinary pictures of an object can be reduced to line drawings. In a line drawing of a three-dimensional object, each line can represent one of the following (a) An edge projecting outwards at the join of two surfaces. Such lines are indicated by labelling them with a'+'. (B) An edge projecting inwards at the (c) An edge at which one of the surfaces hides another. Such lines are labelled with an arrow. The direction of the arrow is such that when walking along the edge the surface which hides the other is always to the right. These labellings are illustrated in fig. ure 1. A brief examination of the diagram will show that the shape which you automatically assign to the object that is represented in the figure is confirmed by the labelling of the lines. Having seen that the labelling corresponds with the way that we see an object, what is needed now is a procedure for automatically labelling any line drawing of a three-dimensional object FIG 4: EXAMPLES the figure illustrated. You might care to try your hand at the examples in figure 4, and to test the results by comparing them with the way that you see the objects. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 93 "

"MACHINE CODE We have not yet covered all the different types of machine code instruction, but we have looked at enough instructions to be able to write some useful routines. Instead of looking at new instructions this month we will look at how to use the routines built in to the computer's ROM in conjunction with the instructions we already know. We need to know the address where the message starts, which we will call MESSGE (abbreviated because assemblers normally allow only six characters), and where the message ends. There are several methods you can use to indicate the end of a message, for example, put zero after the last character, or add 128 to the code for the last character (this will not usually cause any confusion as the codes for the normal printing characters are less than 128) The examples here mostly assume that you know the actual length of the message and the routines count the number of characters printed. The form of the routines is: Initialise pointers Repeat Read character Print character Advance pointer Until end of message We can now look at the routines in detail. also allow the calculations to be per formed in operands. The numbers involved in the arithmetic must be between 0 and 65535, and division always returns an integer re sult, any fractional part being discarded. Thus, if MESSGE were $1234, the first two lines of routine (b) would give MESSHI as $12 and MESSLO as $34, separating the address into its high and low bytes. After the initial calculations routine (b) puts the low and high bytes of MESSGE into the page zero locations MESSAD and MESSAD+I, and sets the Y register to zero. After a character has been printed the pointer is advanced by incrementing the contents of memory location MESSAD (the low byte) and if the low byte becomes zero the high byte also has to be incremented. The test for the end of the message also has to be done in two parts. The high byte of the current address is compared with the high byte of the address of the end of the message (which was calculated at the beginning); if they are not equal the routine loops back to process the next character; if they are equal the low bytes have to be tested. ROUTINES AND HARDWARE LETS GO FOR A LOOP! All computers have built in routines to handle such basic operations as printing a character, reading the keyboard, tape input and output, etc. The details of these routines depend on the hardware of the particular computer, and they are usually quite complicated. For example, the routine to print a character on the screen has to produce the actual dot pattern for the character, keep track of the cursor position, provide automatic carriage return line feed at the end of each line, provide automatic scrolling at the end of the screen, and also has to handle various nonprinting control codes. Before you can use these routines in your own programs you need to find their memory addresses and how to pass values between these ROM routines and your program The manual for the BBC micro gives details of how to use several ROM routines, but with most small computers you have to rely on what users have found out for themselves and published in magazines or books. DEFICIENCIES OF THE 280 SET 6502 Routine (a) is quite simple: we use the X register as a pointer and load the character to be printed into the accumulator using absolute indexed addressing. The character is printed by calling the ROM subroutine OUTCH, and we then increment the X register to point to the next character and compare the value in the X register with the length of the message. If the value in the X register is not equal to the length of the message we loop back to process the next character. Routine (a) can only be used when the message is less than 256 characters long, as the registers in the 6502 are only 8-bits long. If the message is more than 256 characters we can use routine (b), which is more complicated as we have to handle 16-bit numbers in two 8-bit sections. The characters of the message are read into the accumulator using indirect indexed addressing (or post-indexing). This requires the base address to be stored in two consecutive page zero locations, which are called MESSAD and MESSAD+1 in the routine. The first few lines in routine (b) calculate some constants which are used later. A standard 6502 assembler will allow calculations of this type, and will PRINTING THE MESSAGES.. 280 Routine (c) uses the HL register pair as a pointer to the current character and the B register as a counter for the number of characters. Note that, as the compare instruction CP performs a comparision with the accumulator, the contents of the B register are copied into the accumulator in order to perform the comparison. The B register is 8-bits long, so routine (c) can only be used if the message is less than 256 characters. Routine (d) will handle messages with more than 256 characters. The BC register pair is initially loaded with the address of the end of the message and after a character has been printed and the HL pointer incremented the routine tests to see if the contents of HL are equal to the contents of BC. The test is a little complicated because of deficiencies in the 280 instruction set. The 280 has no 16-bit compare instruction. However, you will remember that a compare instruction works by performing a subtraction, and keeps the In the example programs printed here I will assume that to print a character on the screen you have to get the ASCII code for the character into the accumulator and call a subroutine called OUTCH, and I will also be assuming that OUTCH does not alter any of the registers. Most computers do have a routine that works like this. Suppose we have a message stored in the computer's memory, and we want to print the message on the screen.

ROMAN EMPIRE Roman Empire is the latest period war game from M. C. Lothlorien. This Cheshire-based company have become specialists in computerised war gaming with other titles in the range such as Peloponnesian War, Tyrant of Athens, Samurai Warrior, and Japanese Challenge. Roman Empire is a strategy war game requiring thought and application. Graphics are therefore not as crucial to the game as they are in other games. Even allowing for this the graphics in Roman Empire are very unimpressive. All you get are columns of figures with a list of menu options around which the game is based A few more illustrations would have made the various columns of figures far more accessible. The odd map would have been very much appreciated as well. The game has now been converted for the Dragon and Atari computers and some of the above suggested improvements have now been incorporated in these new versions. Why it is not possible to upgrade the Spectrum version is anyone's guess. The idea of the game is to conquer the six countries that are hostile to you. In order to do this you must wipe out your enemies troops. You must build up your legions and launch campaigns in the regions you are attempting to annexe. A constant check has to be kept on your legions morale, fighting efficiency, energy level and status. The only graphic display Roman Empire does give you is when you press the \"next period\" button which totals your victories and defeats. What the display was supposed to be, however, I couldn't tell you. My girlfriend thought it looked like a screen full of ants. Any suggestions? Confirmed war gamers may get something out of this one. For the uninitiated though it would have to have greatly improved on-screen instructions and SPECTRUM TRS80 LV II VIDEO GENIE-SOFTWARE SPACE INVADERS The latest release from Buy-Byte for the BBC micro is a version of that granddaddy of all video games Space Invaders. You would not normally expect a software house to launch a copy of this classic game when several other adequate versions already exist unless it was a particularly good version. This version does not fall into that category. Bug-Byte has not made the most of the BBC's colour and sound potential. The machine is easily capable of producing a truly de-luxe version of Space Invaders though this cassette is sadly unworthy of that description. The mystery saucers did not appear at the correct times and lacked the sound and movement of the arcade original. In the games favour: it was fast and the aliens exploded cleanly when hit.

POWERBOAT RACE If you fancy trying your hand at blasting a weird assortment of aliens and getting lost in the graphics of a maze then Star Maze is the game for you. The idea of the game is to pilot your space shuttle through an enormous scrolling space maze mining the jewels that appear every so often and taking them back to your mother ship The screen is divided into two sections. The left two-thirds of the screen displays the maze and your ship and the remaining third displays all relevent game information score, high score, amount of fuel left, number of bullets left, ships, and various types of aliens drowned. Various aliens are attempting to thwart your mission in the shape of asteroids, cruisers, and toughest of all bug trains. There is only one effective way to deal with the bug trains and that is to use one of your three smart bombs on them. A single bullet will only cause the bug train to split letting out a Pandora's box of nasty aliens. You are armed with a sophisticated laser capable of single fire and also rapid fire. This enables you to use your limited supply of ammunition most effectively. You begin the game with three smart bombs but can earn an extra one each time you clear one level. There are sixteen levels in all though you will need to be a pretty skilled space ace to get that far. After weeks of play I'm still stuck on the sixth Ship control is the most difficult part of Star Maze and it took me quite some time to master the technique. You could really do with a third, or even fourth hand there are that many controls to keep a spare finger on. You have short and long distance thrust rotate left and right, single fire, rapid fire, hyperspace, smart bomb, and even a freeze button which enables you to pause the game to answer the phone or plan your strategy for an imminent alien onslaught. Sound and graphics are not outstanding. I was hooked on Star Maze from the very first session. Once I'd mastered the controls the game became more and more fascinating and I can confidently recommend it as one of the best games now on sale for the Apple. Manufactured by Sirtech for TSR the game is sold by SBD of London at .00. Getting started Value Playability Futura Software's Powerboat Race gives you the chance to pit your wits against the world's top powerboat racers on the BBC model B. The program loaded first time and presented a detailed title page with full playing instructions. You are invited to enter the World Powerboat Championships. You can also choose the one or two player game and name your drivers before the computer chooses your opponent. You'll need joysticks and 32k to play the game and I found it difficult to control the boat at firstalthough this was due more to the joystick than the program. Making life more difficult on the high seas as you race along are two bobbing yellow buoys which must be negotiated to clock up those all important laps. Each race consists of three heats of 15 laps and points are scored according to your position at the end of the race; 400 for first place, 300 for second and 200 for third. The driver scoring the most points over the three heats wins. Screen presentation was quite good with your score and number of laps completed displayed at the bottom of the screen during each race. The game was more frustrating than addictive because of the poor control afforded by the joysticks. Getting started  Value  Playability SOFTWARE FOR THE VIC AND COMMODORE 64 Unexpanded VIC 20.

Telephone (0446) 742491 Remember the pure joy of scribbling? Before you were old enough to be expected to produce forms representing vases or bowls of fruit? When you were allowed to spread colour over an endless supply of pure white paper in the nursery school? Some of that infantile anarchy is let loose in Atari's latest arcade conversion for the 400/800 home computers. The game is called Qix and will already be well known to arcade-goers. For those of you with strict parents who turn purple when you mention your local arcade the game is simple to learn but difficult to master. You control a marker which you must move around the screen drawing boxes. When a box is complete the computer will colour it in either red or blue depending on the speed at which the box was drawn. A red box is worth more points and is drawn more slowly therefore putting you at greater risk from the Qix. This is a shape with four prongs like the head of a fork which bounces around the screen at random. If it careers into your marker when a box is incomplete you loose a life. When you have boxed in 75% of the QIX screen the Qix has insufficient room to manouevre and you then move on to a fresh screen. Two other nasties who track you more systematically than the Qix are the Sparx. You start off with just two of these but their numbers multiply each time the red marker line at the top of the screen shrinks to zero. Watch out for these electronic adversaries running up the lines of your boxes. Also out to get you is the Fuse which will ignite if you stop drawing without having completed a box. Just to make things even tougher the Qix increase in numbers as you move up through the screens. Qix is for one or two players, retains a high score, and is in your local Atari stockists now at .99. For pure originality this game shines out amongst a universe of aliens. It will not grab you from the first play --it takes time to appreciate its subtleties but it is one very good game.

Write to: 2 Bell Lane, Narborough, Leics. ATARI 400/800 OWNERS Blind Alley is a snake chase type game where you have to avoid your own tail and attempt to make two pursuing snakes crash into it. Despite this, the cassette inlay depicts a space scene and gives some blurb about Blind Alley being the sport of the future. New software house Sunshine are not alone in producing misleading cassette inlays. Some of the worst offenders are the established software houses. The idea of the game is to hem in the snakes before they can do the same to you. You score a hundred points for each snake successfully crashed. You begin with two fairly slow snakes and then progress to two quicker ones, then four snakes and so on. Trouble is its all rather slow. The snakes are difficult to control with the keyboard and, if you accidentally press the wrong key they have the annoying habit of disappearing BLIND ALLEY The graphics were not the most colourful I have seen on the Spectrum to say the least. I also felt that the game would have been much better if you had something, or things, to gobble up as you guided your snake around the screen. It is not possible in Blind Alley to rectify a mistaken move by steering yourself out of trouble instead you must start all over again from the beginning. About the only good feature of Blind Alley was the high score board which enabled you to write your name in full, congratulated you on a high score, and kept a 'Hall of Fame.\" Blind Alley is available from Sunshine Software at .95 and runs on the Sinclair Spectrum in 16 or 48K.
