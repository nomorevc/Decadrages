"Speed know the score Tiny blood vessels can rupture or block. 'If this happens in the brain, it can lead to paralysis or coma. Speed affects everyone differently. It can induce feelings of panic, anxiety and even long-term paranoia. It will keep you wide awake and can leave you feeling exhausted and badly depressed for days afterwards. Speed doesn't guarantee you a good time. Most Speed is only 5% pure amphetamine. The rest could be anything. So you never know exactly what you're taking or what the risks could be. Dehydration when dancing on Speed is another danger. To combat this sip about a pint of non-alcoholic liquid an hour to replace lost fluids. Include fruit juices and energy drinks to keep sodium levels up. Remember to chill out. Your heart rate speeds up. This could cause your heart to beat irregularly. You could collapse. This can occur even in young, healthy people. national drugs helpline 0800 77 66 00 If you'd like more information about drugs or just a talk, give us a call free and in total confidence. "

"Video games PAUL DAVIES EINE CVG RATING SYSTEM 15--EXCELLENTES er OCT 4 ... VERY GOOD Pure magic, enough to make a grown man cry. Every game which hits the High Five is essential. Let there be no doubt, this is depth and vision beyond belief. ENDATIOLL ver since he got his Go-Kart nicked from the back field on Christmas Day, Paul has made an extra special effort to value his best toys. Funny how some events can inspire a human being to spend a whole lifetime making up for them. But why this meandering philosophical horse-crap tarnishing the pages of CVG an otherwise bright, colourful, and fun publication? The answer: Phil Dawson. He may have left the magazine, but he hasn't left the building. Nothing is safe. Not even the office copy of Fighting Vipers. Grooargh! We'll get you yet Dawson! LICH HA HIGHES EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES:  Fighters MEGAMIX  Christmas NIGHTS  Legacy of Kain  Mario Kart 64  Rage Racer  Virtual On Usually the highest we feel confident awarding a game. Ranks among the best in its field, or surprises us with elements of well implemented originality. TOM GUISE ...GOOD Something you may want to own, as opposed to renting out for a couple of days. Here is a quality, entertaining game to suit most tastes. Good, but not great. 2... PRETTY BAD nd onto Tom's house, where Phil has spent a jolly weekend tearing up the carpets in his search for food. Slicing chunks of wallpaper from the living room to make party hats, and throwing hamsters as far across the road as they will go from Tom's open window. Okay we are making this up. Chances are Phil spent a perfectly civilised weekend, talking politics with Mr Guise, occasionally taking a break to assist his friend through the more rigorous areas of Mario 64. Drinking tea. Shouting 'Good Day' to neighbours. Chance would be a fine thing. Unlikely to be especially original, or overflowing with exciting features there are better examples available. Or else this is a clumsy attempt at a new concept. DEP EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES:  Christmas NIGHTS  Fighters MEGAMIX  Rage Racer  Mario Kart 64  Virtual On  Christmas Quake ...VERY POOR Almost a flat-liner, it's so lifeless. You'll be wanting to exchange this for something else straightaway. Save yourself the bother by avoiding in the first place. JAIME SMITH GVG HIGHS AND LOWS OF 1996 of someone bei omewhat unfairly, yet much to our amusement, Jaime has been judged \"stinky and boring\" by the CVG Micro Goblin Dave Kelsall. So here's what you do next time you see Jaime in WH Smiths, biting his nails: 1. Assume the manner of someone being choked by abominable fumes worse than Paul's armpits. 2. Ask Jaime a reasonable question, which requires a suitably long answer directions to the video section for example. 3. Act as though this is the most tedious stream-ofconsciousness babble you ever heard and snore loudly. Got that? Excellent. PAUL DAVIES ED LOMAS ART EDITOR CURRENT FAV GAMES:  Mario Kart 64  SF Alpha (arcade)  Killer Instinct Gold  Fighters MegaMix  Rage Racer  Tehken World Cup MIKE NEWSON  Best Game: NIGHTS! Technically I should be voting for Mario 64 as that game is a monument, but Sonic Team obviously spent longer practising their hocus pocus.  Biggest Shame: This is a toss between Cheesy the Mouse, and the delay of N64 in the UK. But at least Nintendo are trying to grow the market not kill it.  Medal of Honour: Definitely Sony for estab lishing the PlayStation as the Number One games system across the world. It's almost scary how it happened!  Best Game: For me it's a close thing between Quake and NIGHTS. One is the best multiplayer and most customisable game ever, and the other is a clever, non-stop magical score challenge.  Biggest Shame: Some excellent games not selling as well in the UK as I feel they should NIGHTS, SF Alpha, etc. Plus Sega's marketing of the Saturn. They need to sort that out, big time. . Medal of Honour: Sonic Team for NIGHTS, AM2 for VF3, id Software for Quake, and Sony for being so successful in the games market. Am ! allowed to give out that many medals? hile the rest of us continue our daily business, dressed in the same rags we started CVG wearing a year ago, Mike... doesn't. He's our last remaining connection to the real world of fast cars, faster women, and music from 12:00 till 7:00 am. A fashion icon within the office, who swaggers in each day like a catwalk model, wearing the latest threads, before settling down to work to the sounds of our generation. Occasionally he might enjoy a game of Quake or C&C: Red Alert, and for a moment we glimpse a hope for us all. Then it's gone. Oh Mike. Mike.

He has been showing signs of hyper excitement caused by too much Cola on deadline. Assistant Alex has removed some of the problems of overheating we've experienced of late, but it seems the stand-alone unit requires direct attention. So we're exchanging his crusty old swivel chair for a Sulky Drive kind of like Nintendo's Bulky Drive for N64, only more subdued.

Ibuki is a Japanese Schoolgirl Ninja. Alex is an American with a powerful punch! DUDLEY STREET FIGHTER 3 NEW GENERATION REVEALED The first three tantalising screen shots of the Japanese version of Street Fighter III have been released. As you ought to know, Street Fighter III is the second of Capcom's games to use the new CP-System III board. Though Street Fighter Ill is still in development, we know already from Red Earth (War-Zard) how advanced the graphical capabilities of CP-System III are, brandishing silkysmooth animations and almost ten times the amount of colours on screen. Street Fighter III, then, should look totally incredible in action. So, a full report GUARANTEED for next issue. The only gameplay details are these: There are three Super Special Moves per character, though only one can be selected. A new blocking action, perhaps similar to an Alpha (Zero) counter, is included stop an opponent's move then retaliate with one of your own. The only characters carried over from the original World Warriors are Ryu and Ken, everyone else is new. Here's a first look at three. Capcom's CP-System III. Games transfer from the CD.

You decide! If the New Year's celebrations have put you in a party mood, you might be interested in this novel music-tinkering package for the PC. Mixman allows you to mess around with eight different dance tracks, recording your own 'awesome' setpiece out of them. Breaking the tunes into 16 separate components, you can blend any of them together. Adding and removing the different sounds at will. There's also a few neat tricks, such as adding breaks or twiddling the pitch. And it sets the timing of the sounds for you, so it never sounds (too) bad. The music is pretty good. A blend of garage, techno and ethnic dance stuff from the likes of the Bassbin Twins, Saharafish, Freaky Chakra and Mephisto Odyssey, to name a few. It's a simple package (not for serious musical types), but Ed and Tom have had fun on it (expect their new album this year) And at  it's fairly priced.

"PRE-XMAS PLAYSTATION PANIC! WIN NAMCO CALENDARS! computer video games In the run-up to Christmas, European demand for PlayStation has been such that retailers in some countries have been unable to get any more machines from Sony. As reported in trade newspaper CTW the week prior to Christmas, Sony had no more supplies of their console in Italy, Spain, Benelux or Scandanavia, with Germany and France also suffering shortages. While there's concern that these countries would have no machines on the shelves during Christmas week, Sony were confident the UK wouldn't suffer this problem. CTW also revealed latest PlayStation ship-out figures (to retailers not consumers). 10 million worldwide, with 4.2 million in Japan, 3.45 million in America and 2.35 million in Europe. Next month we hope to bring you an look at the post-Christmas aftermath, seeing how all games systems have fared! We're certainly big Namco fans at the moment here at CVG. What with Rage Racer currently taking our office by storm, and Soul Edge and Time Crisis set to appear next month. We have big plans for these and other PlayStation games next issue, but you'll have to wait till next month to find out what. In the meantime, we've got twenty-five snazzy Namco desktop calendars to give away. Each month featuring a smart piece of official Namco art. So the first 25 entries sent to Namco Calendar Comp, at the usual address, can have them! COMMAND AND CONQUER CONQUERS!

With Command & Conquer now having justifiably taken the world by storm, we're bound to see some similar' games. Krush, Kill 'N' Destroy is one such title. The work of Beam Software (a team from the old Melbourne House label), KKND is blatantly inspired by C&C. Only this time it's set in a post-apocalyptic future, with mutants battling human survivors. Although the style is different ( mutants ride spiders and have bone-buildings etc), the resource management and battling is near identical. Electronic Arts are publishing the game over here, and they're hoping that its lower cost (under ) will make many potential C&C fans choose this option instead. We'll review it next month.

With PC proving popular this Christmas, there's bound to be a lot of new PC gamers out there having trouble loading DOS games. Enter Power2Play. This application allows you to load DOS games and applications through Windows '95. It will autosearch for certain titles (Mechwarrior, Doom and Duke Nukem among them). Others can be easily added manually through its simple interface. What's more, it provides a special window so you can shortcut straight to your games menu. Definitely a good application for that PC owner who just wants to play games without all the Ed Lomasstyle techy fuss. And it's only .99. If you're still a faithful Megadrive gamer seeking classics (something we wholeheartedly approve of), you'll be pleased to hear that Codemasters have brought out some of their best titles on budget carts! The Double Hits packs feature two games on one cart, each for only .99. The sports cart features Brian Lara Cricket and Pete Sampras Tennis, while the arcade action cart has Micro Machines and Psycho Pinball. CVG considers both to be an excellent deal. Better still though, is Micro Machines 2 at . It's an all-time classic and you should still play four-player link up now. Ya hear! Maxi's latest Sim game, SimCopter, was delayed from its December 13th release, due to a bit of naughty internal vandalism. It seems one of the programmers decided to respond to the 'portrayal of women in video games, by putting semi-naked men in the game instead of a brass band. As such, the game's release was put back until January 10th while they reprogrammed it. NEWS "

Well I heard that the ELSPA rating on the back of video games cannot be used to prevent people from actually buying the game, and that it is only a guideline for parents etc. But when I went to buy Quake for my PC the bloke at the shop wouldn't let me. I can't understand why. If you don't print this letter I'll kill you for absolutely no reason, but can you print it anyway. Keep up the good work in this fabulous mag that I will keep buying forever.

ALL MOD CONS JAGO SP WETTERS Dear CVG, I am a disabled person who likes playing video games so I bought a PlayStation from day one. But wish I'd bought a Sega Saturn as it's got all the good games. So bought a Saturn a couple of months ago. I could have gone to the Arcades but how many do you know have lifts or ramps, for example Sega World? I've read nothing about a lift. I'm sure that lots of disabled people like playing video games. M Ali, London CVG: We spoke to Freuds, the PR company who represent Segaworld, and they explained that there is wheelchair access though it is the policy of London's Trocadero centre to only admit three people in wheelchairs into the complex at any one time. This may seem harsh, but it's due to fire regulations. Anybody who requires a wheelchair to get about is allowed into Segaworld free of charge. And if you have an assistant with you, they get in for half price. If you have any further questions, here's the number you should call: 0171 580 2626. SEGAWORLD You'll need to pay BIG money to get a really good N64 SCART picture. "


"BUILD IT AND THEY WILL COME computer video games BAG Dear CVG, The point that I want to bring to your attention is simple. The demo disc which I got from Sega Saturn Magazine caused me to go out and spend  on World Wide Soccer 97. Why? Because I was so impressed by the demo version of the game that I could not resist buying the full game. Then I opened up the December edition of your most hallowed mag to discover that Sega are releasing a 'special version of NIGHTS to encourage people to vote Saturn. Now I know this is also open to existing Saturn owners but let's face it, Christmas NiGHTS has been released to attract people to the Saturn. This is where my semi original ideas come in. Why don't Sega... 1. Compile three or four demos of upcoming or classic games and give them away with their top titles. 2. Sell the CDs to top magazines such as yourself who then give their readers the opportunity to send off for the discs. The point that I am making is that my demo disc told me more about WW897 than any review ever could. I got to play it. I felt what it was like to win a match, to score a goal. As like to try before I buy it was perfect for me, and I am sure that I am not the only one with this attitude to games. Robert Small, Lytham St Annes = Fist 917 CVG: Yes, it is important for players to get hands-on experience of games. So it's frustrating to see such dismal set-ups in a lot of the major games stores, and especially the consumer electronics stores. Wish we could mention some names here! Point is, if more people could experience those great games we say are worth buying, it's more than likely that more games would sell. Sadly cover discs are out of the question for CVG We cover too many formats to keep everyone happy. The demo disc idea is definitely a good one for Sega. They read this magazine, so... Sega World Wide Soccer 97: Playable demos encouraged sales of the game. We think that the free Christmas NIGHTS demo will help sales of \"real\" NIGHTS. 64-BIT! 3D! AWESOME! T-T-T-TEKKEN T-T-T-2 Dear CVG, Brill mag. Wicked poster. Any chance of more in future issues? A few questions! 1. I've heard rumour that Japanese N64s can play UK/US games. Is this true? 2. Are Sony making a 64-bit upgrade? In issue #174 Tom said \"Sony are working on a PlayStation upgrade.\" Then, in issue #174 he said \"Don't hold your breath\". Well, are they making one or not. 3. Tekken 3, any more news? Will it be released on any more systems? 4. Street Fighter 3D looks cool! It will come to PS won't it? 5. Star Wars: SOTE looks awesome. Any news on the storyline? PS I killed a person called Pink Floyd in network Quake. Was it Ed? Sean Cooper, Dublin impossible to insert the 'chip', and in the process completely messed something up. I mean something like the speed the code runs off the CD. This is the only thing I can think of because my friend's PlayStation is an older model. Please can you help me clear this up, because you are the ones that people like Sony and Namco listen to. I'd also like to hear from anyone else who has experienced this problem. c Coleman, S Wales Dear CVG, You are my last hope. I have put this problem to everyone I know and I just CANNA get an answer! On the 18th October 1996 I bought a PlayStation, my second one at that (I sold the first because of lack of software at the time). Now since I didn't have any games with it, I had a lend of a couple of my friends. These all worked perfectly. Soon after buying my PlayStation purchased Tekken 2 (one of the main reasons I bought another one) and brought it home to grace my PlayStation. Now this is where everything started to get weird. First of all Tekken 2 worked perfectly. Then, after a day or two it suddenly started playing up. By this I mean that the intro FMV would be all scrambled and the music was just so broken up you couldn't even make it out. This problem seemed to effect the in-game music as well. Then the game wouldn't load properly either, taking absolutely ages and the majority of the time it crashed. This also affected the end sequences. I took Tekken 2 down to my buddy's house to see if it would work. To my amazement it worked perfectly. * USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES CVG: 1. Yes, but there is some minor surgery required on the casing. 2. They're almost certain to be planning a follow-up to the PlayStation, yes. A 64-bit upgrade for the existing system, no. ED: It probably was me. You can normally tell, as I spend more time sending messages than fighting. CVG: We've had complaints from a fair few people about this problem. The route of the problem is reputedly the plastic 'turntable', which distorts when overheated. After a few months of concentrated use this causes games to suffer drop-outs in the music, or FMV to stutter badly, and in some cases fail to load at all! As you can imagine, all our PlayStations are full-on all day, so are struggling a bit. If your PlayStation is going nuts, try turning it on its side, or even upside down as a short-term measure. However Sony are especially efficient at meeting their customers' needs, and have been known to replace systems free of charge, within reason. Also, the most recent production line are fitted with metal components to postpone any malfunctions. The problem however progressed on my PlayStation now it won't even load. I know what you're thinking the lens is dirty, the disc is scratched and dirty. That is definitely not the answer. Now could it be that Sony have changed the insides of the PlayStation once again as to make it 13 "


"computer video DUN WAITIN WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW games Dear CVG, As I have recently subscribed to your excellent mag, I feel obliged to add my opinions and beliefs. This letter has been written in the heat of my blistering rage! This rage was brought on by the sheer laziness of THE Games (the company that took over from Nintendo UK). They have failed to stand up for the gaming public of Britain; they have let release dates slip for the Nintendo 64, and go back on their words due to any sudden whim of Nintendo Japan (I am referring to the promise of a better deal for all RPG fanatics of Britain, with many more releases supposed to occur; but they never did). So I have moved my financial backing to the importers, and in turn to THE's foreign counterparts. They have all the latest releases months before the official release date, at around the same price thanks to the favourable exchange rates, and you do not get those annoying black bands above and below the screen if you buy an import machine. I can only assume that THE's utter lameness is due to the fact that they are a relatively new company, and they don't have the guts to n against the flow of Nintendo's overbeari word. I just hope they get their act together soon. Jeffrey Sheen, Crowborough Dear CVG, There's something that's been bothering me for a long time. A lot of letters that I read in mags and things I hear from other gamers are biased towards games, companies or certain systems. People blabbering about how their system is top notch while others are no good and a waste of money. It seems that some people are busier doing that than enjoying their games. I'm 20 years old now and I've been playing games \"playing games for quite a while. I've been very happy with every system I owned. In the beginning I had an MSX. I didn't know anything about specs or other systems. I was just having fun playing the games. And as I got older, I learned more about consoles and the whole gaming scene. I also noticed people being biased, including myself. But then I thought: Isn't this about entertainment and having fun? I've owned an import PlayStation for about a year now and because of great games like NIGHTS, Virtua Fighter 2 and X-Men, I bought an import Saturn this year. And I hope to own a Nintendo 64 by next year or so. You don't have to own multiple systems to appreciate them. I'm just saying that you should have fun with your machine and have an objective opinion towards others. As for games mags, there aren't many that cover all systems and are unbiased. In fact, there's only one, and that's CVG! CVG! Peter Klungel, Appingedam CVG: Right, so now it's our fault?! We know that there are lots of players out there who don't buy games magazines, and are happily oblivious to what's going on elsewhere. Unfortunately that's not the kind of culture we're trying to create with CVG We want everyone to appreciate all games!!! So, hurrah for Peter Klungel and others like him. CVG * i dropping. But within two weeks of ent I had the game licked with all 17 aracters, and except for an occasional spin with my favourite eam, Cammy and Rogue, the game offers little to sway me away from the newly crowned VF3, and KOF 96 in my opinion the best 2D beat 'em around at the moment. come on Capcom, pull your socks jee a Saturn Star Gladiator, a PlayStation Marvel Super Heroes, arcade SF Zero 3, and my biggest wish, SF3 blow away all competition. STAR LETTER GIVE US A CHANCE! CVG: We can appreciate your frustration, Jeffrey, but THE Games aren't to blame for Nintendo's UK policy. THE, for a intents and purposes, are a distributor and have been runnii pretty tight and successful business. In fact we hear they were congratulated at a private dinner in Japan this past Shoshinkai. So, we're just as frustrated over the lack of first-rate RPGs to have been released especially Final Fantasy III (VI). But we hear Nintendo are right on schedule for March 1st 1997 with N64. In the meantime there's Terranigma, Tetris Attack and Donkey Kong Country 3 to keep you going. Before I sign off could you please answer my Capcom crazy Q's please: USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES 1. Who is the dude in Guy's ending (and in the portrait of Guy on the Saturn illustrations)? 2. Is Dan the son of Gouken (Sheng Long)? I presume that is Gouken who appears in the Saturn illustration of Dan with a bloody face. What is Dan's relationship to Sagat? I once read that Sagat killed Dan's father, who was stated as being Donovan from Vampire Hunter. What's the deal? Dear CVG, As a newly converted Saturn devotee I must admit I am slightly alarmed at the demise of so many computers/consoles in such a short time. Although consoles have been around for more than a decade it's frightening to see how many systems have been dumped for more powerful hardware. Less than two years ago Mr Mega Drive strolled around the block, assured of its God-like ability for gaming potential. Yet it's been dropped faster than the Spectrum in favour of 32-bit gaming. What's more scary is the potential oneupmanship of rival companies vying for a slice of cutting edge technology. How soon will the 32-bit become obsolete and the Nintendo 64 a thing of the past? It seems that the drive for more powerful (and expensive) machines is hotting up and while some may swoon over the potential of the PlayStation 128 and the Saturn 512, the existing machines will never be fully exploited and Mr Consumer will pay through the nose for hardware that's obsolete within a week. Matthew Bullman, Airedale 1214215 08 DE OTS we Just think of all those fantastic Super NES games you can be playing until the UK release of Mario Kart 64... like Mario Kart! Finally, for SF freaks like me, any chance of the following two features in your excellent mag? 1. SF1 feature, pics and character profiles. I haven't seen the old game in ages and can't remember who the fighters are who didn't return in SF Zero. 2. A SF history chart showing all the characters and their relationships to each other, similar to the Tekken 2 one in the CVG review for that game. (Like many others have the Japanese copy of SF Zero 2, and thus can't read the dramatic battle speeches and the character endings). lan Michael Wragg FOR DIE-HARD FIGHTING FANS ONLY SUT Dear CVG, As much as I love Street Fighter and Capcom, and I mean love as in maniacally obsessed, I have a confession to make. I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that SF has been usurped by AM2's masterpiece VF3. In the past my preference, and money, has always lied with Capcom's fist feast, but after weeks of spending far too much money on VF3, at  a slog, I feel Sega have produced the ultimate fighting game so far. Yes the graphics of VF3 are stunning, but the gameplay has built on VF2 to make the most enjoyable game I have played in a long time. I really want Capcom to sway me back to their flock with the upcoming SF EX, SF Zero 3, and of course the legendary SF3. But I have my doubts, SF Vs XMen being the main cause of my concern. Yes it is a very impressive game, watching Apocalypse for the first time with other avid gamers, I remember all CVG: The man depicted in Guy's end tribute is Goutetsu, his teacher.Dan is not the son of Gouken, though it is Gouken who appears in the illustration you mention. Sagat killed Dan's father, which is why he sometimes cries and shakes his fist at Sagat before fighting the word he says translates as \"Father\" in Japanese). Sniff. But Donovan ain't Dan's Dad, an' dat's dat. About those ideas, if we get enough requests we'll do something about it. (By the way, lan would like you all to know that it was he who was responsible for the 2D Into Infinity' letter a while back.) CVG: From a gamer's point of view, especially those who invest large amounts of money building a huge collection, to see their machine become 'obsolete' is a major concern. But there is a large element of peer pressure involved here you don't have to buy a new machine the month it's launched, and hardware manufacturers do support their older machines until the bitter end. It's in their best interest too y'know. Besides, six or seven years is a fairly good innings for any piece of hardware, let alone one that's so fashion driven as the console. And the 32-bit scene is nowhere near the size of the 16-bit one at this stage of its development. Perhaps this is users such as yourself demonstrating just how far they're willing to go within a reasonable budget in such a small time scale. NIME 14 "

"* THE VIRTUA VIPERS VS FIGHTING FIGHTERS! * computer Video games 09 Putting the Virtua Fighter characters against the Fighting Vipers makes everything a bit unbalanced. To sort this out, there are two modes one to make the game play like Fighting Vipers, and one to make it more like VF! MELAMIX VIRTUA FIGHTER MODE FIGHTING VIPERS MODE SATURN In this mode, all of the Virtua Fighter characters can do armour-breaking moves, shown by a white flash just before the move connects, as well as the mid-air recovery of Vipers pressing all three main buttons at once makes the fighter flash green and land on their feet. And they can all do Fighting Vipers flashing power counters! There are also fancy smoke effects on certain moves, small explosions show hits, and dust flies up when someone hits the floor. When the game's set in Virtua Fighter Mode, all of the fancy effects of Vipers Mode are removed. Also, the action is toned down a bit uppercut attacks don't throw people so high in the air, and big hits don't send people flying backwards so far. The armour breakers and mid-air recoveries are also removed, making it play a lot more like Virtua Fighter 3 overall. 1 When hit into the air, pressing one land on their feet.

In Rage the technique varies from car to car, but mostly involves taking the pressure off the accelerator for a split second, then jamming it back for the drift.

So blood curdling that you're heart might burst under the pressure! Now loading LEGACY OF KAIN he ficticious character Kain was once an ordinary man, unfortunate enough to have been set upon by thieves and killed. As fate would have it a Necromancer succeeded in trapping Kain's spirit, whereupon a deal between the two was struck. Kain would get revenge on his assassins, the Necromancer would get Kain's soul. Thus Kain became a Vampire! Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain places you in charge of Kain, as he mercilessly slays the inhabitants of Nosgoth. Doesn't matter whether they're armed or barely conscious enough to fight, man or woman, Kain murders them all the same! There is, of course, a point to all of this. Yes, Kain does have the opportunity to vanquish himself. And that hope too is in your hands. HOW TO DRESS YOUR VAMPIRE BLOOD SUCKING DIRTY VAMPIRE! Aside from the blood letting, another great feature in LOK is the costume changing. As the plot starts to thicken or should that be coagulate Kain builds a collection of alternate suits of armour, alongside a handsome choice of weapons. These are interchangeable from a special menu, from where you can experiment to find the most devastating combination. Eventually kain finds himself in posession of five types of armour, and five types of weapon. Some examples we've found so far include: B KAIN'S WEAPONS CARDIAC CRIMSON CUISINE Kain is a filthy blood-sucking vampire! That's not just his reputation you actually get to see him do it, over and over again. Basically his life depends on it. Unless he feeds, he dies. Certain spells, and a special variety of armour, do the work for Kain. However he starts by using manual skills... Iron Swords Though it's the first weapon Kain owns, it's value is that it has a long reach and is quite speedy. Fends off baddies while you think of a better solution. Kain assaults his victim until they reach a semi-unconcious, or \"waver' state. Arm outstretched, he drains the victim dry! SLIGHT ALTERATION TO THE MENU 3 COMING SOON Mace Primarily used to stun victims in double-quick time, though it takes longer to finish the job if it's a kill you're after. Doubles as a powerful demolition device. You may have heard that royalty has blue blood. Well, Kain has yet to find that out for himself. However he is aware of more than one variety and not all are beneficial. Drinking black blood causes kain to lose blood instantly. Green poisonous blood gradually decreases Kain's blood supply. It's okay to drink blue corpuscles, as it replenishes magic energy. Blue blood only comes from the bodies of previous victims who appear as shadows on screen. BD BD BD BDCDD Dual Axe: As this is a two-handed weapon Kain is prevented from using his magic. However its authority is unquestionable. Handy for cutting down trees too. 28 "


"computer video games Playstation KAIN'S VILE BAG OF TRICKS As ever in a game of this type, we don't ask how Kain manages to keep such an enormous inventory about his person. It's because he's a vampire, okay! Vampires can do anything they like! Anyhow, his collection of magical artifacts can only used if selected. And such items are only selectable if they are arranged into one of two 'Quick Menus' loaded up with stuff from Kain's main collection. VAMPIRE ABROAD As a delicate skinned, stiff-legged 'Nosser' Kain is somewhat limited as to where he may roam. He doesn't like rain. Can't stand snow. Detests getting his feet wet, and refuses to climb anywhere. Guess he's just a walking and killing kind of guy! Still, there are alternative guises he can adopt to make afterlife more outgoing. In addition to the ones listed below, Kain may also affect the form of mist. Otar uprapto Rosqof alla's Lastion Sanctuary is the first item Kain collects, found in his Sanctaury no less. This artifact allows the vampire to instantly escape danger to the safety of his sarcophagus. Others are much more...violent. Bat after Lunch: Kain's body disperses as a group of bats. This is only possible when out in the open, and takes kain to key locations. BLOOD SUCKING DIRTY VAMPIRE! Big Bada Vampire Hounds Kain chooses to adobt the form of the wolf to leap over streams, and up or down rocky crags. The wolf also runs much faster than Kain. Flay is a magic item which strips the flesh of any living creature, and terminates the agony of the undead. This long-range weapon, as well as producing impressive results, is the most common. NOOS INIWOD KAIN'S ARMOUR Bone Armour The weaker variety of undead enemies ignore Kain. It definitely helps to remember this, as zombies are known to rise from the floor and sur round Kain. Chaos armour: An enemy's attack strength is reflected back on them, so the weaker variety tend to place themself in waver state more often than not by their own foolishness. 29 "

VOICE FROM THE CRYPT Most of the information in the game is passed on through Kain's thoughts, which is conveyed as a narrative spoken over the top of the action.

LISTINCT TINCT iller Instinct was originally billed in the arcade as the first \"Ultra 64\", game. The logo appeared on all the cabinets and was set to be one of the first games released for the new Nintendo machine. Of course, Killer Instinct 2 arrived before long, and an upgraded version of that was decided on for the N64: Killer Instinct Gold! And here it is, with everything from the arcade version, plus new combos, new modes, and new 3D backgrounds! GO WHO'S HERE E* 3D ARENAS OF DEATH! * RARE'S 24-KARAT KILLER INSTINCT GOLD! All of the fighting arenas in Killer Instinct Gold are completely 3D. While the game itself doesn't involve dodging around the ring, the view moves, about occasionally, giving a good view of some spectacular scenery. Since killer Instinct Gold is based on 2. the character ist is the same. Chief Thunder. Cinder and Riotor have left since the first game, but new fighters Mava, Kim-Wu and Tush more than make up for them. And, while each character could perform regular combos of up to SO nits in the arcade. everyone's been enhanced in a Gold so that they can reach 90! JAGO'S BRIDGE GARGOS'S DUNGEON CULO 1 Not many of Maya's special attacks are done with rolling motions, and she has no projectiles. To make up for this, she is fast and has some lightning dashing attacks using her knives. A rickety rope bridge across a misty chasm. Enemies can be finished by knocking them over the edge! A huge wall through the dun, geon is where the fighting's done. Again, you can knock people over the edge! COMBO'S STREET KIM'S DOJO 1 Kim-Wu is another fast fighter, but she's got slow-to-perform fireballs to balance things out. One advantage she's got over the other fighters is the ability to roll along the ground. The view spins right around on this arena to show passing trains in the background! This square ring is on a mountain surrounded by mist. Finished enemies bounce down the mountain side! 70 SPINAL'S SHIP Arr94 SABREWULF'S CASTLE TRIPLE 1 Tusk's giant sword makes him one of the most powerful fighters in the game, but he's a bit slow. He's got a good selection of special moves to cover him from aerial and ground attacks. A massive wooden boat with undead oarsmen! The crates can be smashed, and opponents drowned! A ruined castle with an open fire still burning. To the right of the stage is a wall which can be smashed down! 32 "

Finish the game on that Jevel to pot all five secret option screens, along with Ludicrous speed! NINTENDO 64 The main reason for playing Killer Instinct Gold over Kl2 in the arcades is that you can spend as long as you like mastering ridiculous combos, which would cost a fortune in pound coins. Kl Gold's Training Mode is one of the best yet seen in a fighting game, as the floating Master teaches you moves, combos and counters! He tells you what to do, then changes, into your character and even demonstrates it in slow motion for you to copy. If you can get perfect \"A\" grades on EVERY challenge in Training, Mode on the Hard setting, you get crowned Grand Master and a couple of special outfits are added to that character's wardrobe.. w TRESS START TEEN 1 Some secret options, including the great Invisible Tag (below)! 03 CLASS HT Exercise 3 Osmke w si boy V Brahe exercise * GEL SER GP.AND MASTER! 1 The buttons you are pressing show up at the bottom of the screen.

At the end of the game, as long as the difficulty setting is high enough, players come across Gargos. An enormous gargoyle, he's the last character to beat on the way to becoming Killer Instinct champion! Enormous trees and vines sur round Maya's fighting arena. Wild animals honk away in the distance to put you off! Glacius has crashed his ship in the snow, and chooses to fight in front of it. Loose bits of ship can be knocked around.

Using a hidden command, you can fight on this floating arena. It's very small, and one good combo finish is all it takes to send someone flying over the edge! 33 "


"computer video games THE KI GOLD COMBO STARTER CLASS! COMBO LESSON 4: LINKERS A Linker is a special move which, when performed in a combo after an Auto or Manual-Double, won't knock your opponent down. This leaves you to do another Double off the Linker, then continue the combo! There are also Super Linkers which are mega versions of Super Moves, hitting many times quickly and keeping combos going. Killer Instinct's major unique point is the completely over-the-top combo system. The entire game is based around learning and perfecting complex combinations of standard attacks and special moves, and it's necessary to spend a LONG time mastering all of this before you have any chance of being good at the game. INTENDO 64 COMBO LESSON E OPENERS Almost any close-up special move will work as an Opener, making your opponent reel from the hit, and enabling you to string more attacks on the end. The best moves to use are those which make your character quickly dash in close and hit. COMBO LESSON 5: END FINISHERS These are special moves which, when performed at the end of a combo, will hit multiple times and look, great! Each character has four regular End Finishers which get more impressive and longer as they are used more, and once all four have been performed the fighter gains a hidden Fifth End Finisher! CILIK RANVA HYPE COMBO LESSON 2: AUTO-DOUBLES An Auto Double is a single button press immediately after another attack, which produces a double hit. The thing is, you can only Auto Double with specific buttons: A Medium attack to follow a Fierce one, a Quick attack to follow a Medium, and a Fierce to follow a Quick. For example, if you open a combo with Orchid's Fierce Flik Flak, then immediately press Medium Punch, you'll get an Auto Double and two free hits! COMBO LESSON 6: ULTRA COMBOS Ultra Combos are special moves which, when performed after a Double of some sort, send a fighter into overdrive, hacking and smashing away at their opponent! They can only be done when the enemy has a flashing red energy bar, but can be put on the end of already massive combos, and have Super End Finishers put on the end of them to get 80+ hits! Unlike the first Killer Instinct, Ultra Combos can now be countered, so long as the victim has enough super energy! 1 C-C-C-C-Combo Breaker! Stop the evil Gargos's multiple hits! TRIPLE PERFECT RARE'S 24-KARAT KILLER INSTINCT GOLD! WAL WTONY COMBO LESSON 3: MANUAL-DOUBLES Manual-Doubles are similar to Auto Doubles, only they are slightly harder to perform. It's a bit like a Chain Combo in Street Fighter Alpha, in that a quick tap of a Fierce attack, then a Medium attack will link together to give you a Manual Double. If these are used in big combos, they are very difficult to break. 1 This Super Move of Combo's smashes down the walls! PER  COMBO LESSON 7: NOW IT GETS REALLY COMPLEX! We just don't have the space to go into real detail about KI Gold's combo system here, but believe us: It gets much more complicated from here on! There's plenty more to learn, including Pressure Doubles, Juggles, Combo Breakers, Air Combos and Counters, Shadow Combos, Air-Doubles, Mini-Ultras, Parry Moves, and loads more! You need to learn how to link the entire lesson together, memorise it, then perform it exactly right to stand a chance of getting an elusive 80+ hit combo! BULLCLACKERSI ALL OF IT THE CABINET MINISTER, THE WHOLE BUSINESSI 1 BLASTER 1 You can even team battle with up to 11 characters each! for ULTIMATE... COMBO! NOOS NINO. 3 1 The deaths are a bit disappointing. Each of the fighters has two death moves which can only be performed when their opponent's energy bar is flashing red. One of them is a special attack which can be done from anywhere on-screen, and will start some sort of grisly death if it connects and isn't blocked. The other is a type of Combo End Finisher, which is put in a combo after an DOTUSR Auto-Double to end the fight there and then! Also, most backgrounds can be used to finish people off, with specific Combo End Finishers sending opponents flying over the edge of the level!

Muddy is such a rare mole that he demonstrates incredible strength by hoisting huge black balls around.

But don't leave until you've blown the zombies to pieces! CRYPT KILLER ** re XZ f you go to an arcade, there's one gun game which stands out as fun even before you've seen what it is. It's a cabinet with three plastic shotguns plugged into it, just waiting for players to dish out death to all sorts of evil slime monsters. Konami, creators of the popular Lethal Enforcers gun games, are now releasing Crypt Killer, as well as their own PlayStation light gun (unfortunately not one of the shotguns) and we thought you'd like to know more about how it's coming along. THE NEW PLAYSTATION HORROR GUN GAME! WHICHWAY * YOU'RE DEADI In the arcades, Crypt Killer was played with a brightly-coloured plastic pump action shotgun, but on the PlayStation it uses Konami's own light gun. The gun was originally released at the same time as Horned Owl in Japan, and will work with pretty much every PS gun game, like Die Hard Trilogy. As with Sega's Virtua Cop games, Crypt Killer is nowhere near as much fun with a joypad as with a gun. In a similar way to Virtua Cop 2, there are alternate routes through each level in Crypt Killer. Part-way through each level, the game breaks while a bald man asks you to choose a path. You must then shoot away the chains on one of two doors to pick your route. This leads to multiple endings and more replay value! Attacks to the left damage player 1, while those to the right hurt player 2. WHERE DO WE START? TERRORS FROM THE CRYPT You'll come across some very strange enemies in Crypt Killer. For example, There are six main levels which can be tackled in any order by shooting the rotating pictures at the start of the game. They all stick to the same adventure theme, but go through forests, caves, mountains, and even underwater! ZOMBIES who climb BATS who give free BLUE BLOBS from the floor then guns if their wings with arms! throw their ribs at you! are shot as they fall! Disgusting! THE HYDRA with all of its heads is one of the bosses! PORTA COMING SOON SOMEZ IETS KILLE CHIPTSI Let's be honest: Crypt Killer isn't the best looking game ever. In fact, the graphics are pretty feeble. BUT, both the arcade game and the PlayStation version are good fun, and you'll be able to find out what we think in next month's review... hopefully. 38 Even Medusa is in the game! Don't look at her!

SONIC 3DS SO he game that really set the Mega Drive going was Sonic the Hedgehog. And because of this, the gaming world has eagerly been awaiting the first Sonic game on Sega's current machine the Saturn. That first game is here, and it's a graphical upgrade of the Mega Drive game of the same name, released in November last year, with some incredible 3D special stages added! Of course, we're also waiting for the other Saturn Sonic game which is hopefully due next year, direct from the Sonic Team! LLEICS EX LIFE O DOOD TOOT TOOT! THE SATURN VERSION OF SONIC 3D! THAT LOOKS FAMILIAR... The new rendered intro for Sonic 3D is very impressive. Sonic sprints around the Green Grove Zone, jumping over holes and freeing his Flicky friends from the Badnik robo-shells! Sonic 3D on Saturn is almost totally identical to the Mega Drive version reviewed in issue 180. Obviously, the graphics are a lot better but the level design is just the same. By far the biggest differences are the special stages, which you can read about elsewhere on the page. The bridge on the left now wobbles nicely. The Robotnik statue on the right wasn't in the MD version. There's now a map to show Sonic's route through the game, ending up at Robotnik's Panic Puppet! AMAZING 3D SONIC SPECIAL STAGES! 159 RINGS 100 Getting to the special stages is done just the same way as before, collecting and giving a total of 50 rings or more to either Knuckles or Tails hidden around the levels. The new Saturn stages start with Sonic's friend flying and dropping our hero into a trough just like those in Sonic 2 on the Mega Drive. The characters are all completely 3D, and look brilliant just like Sonic does in Christmas NiGHTS. NOUS INIWUJ Just like in Sonic 2, the idea is to collect the required number of rings before reaching each checkpoint. Running into the bombs makes you roll and drop a load of precious rings! Reach the end with enough rings and you're awarded a Chaos Emerald! "

These Flickies follow Sonic around until he drops them off at a ring teleporter once all five are dropped off the warp to the next section of the act opens up!

"computer video games BLAGGER'S GUIDE TO COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES We preach enough times about which games are best by whatever company. We expected you understood what we blather on about too. However a colossal «EH?», size of Ed's Tips Bible, just ricocheted across the galaxy * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * eading you loud and clear CVG fans in distress! Word is that there are some of you who aren't so clued up as the rest of us. Worse, there are brothers and sisters out there who have lost the plot. We cannot let this go on! So our answer to all the confusion is this: a hurricane tour through the awesome world of computer and video games, telling you whose games are outstanding in the most important areas, and directing your attention to others perhaps more obscure. BLAGGER'S GUIDE TO COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES B 20-0We've spread these eight pages across the centre so that you can remove them from the main magazine for later reference. Understand that six full pages, plus one we've used for intriguing facts and figures, isn't sure to provide real breadth of understanding remember this is a \"Bagger's Guide'. But by giving you a taste of all the juicy bits, there's every chance you'll want to become a conoisseur in one or more of the areas covered. Just like music, video games are created to appeal to many different tastes. And, just like music, the process of defining categories becomes increasingly more complex as new styles evolve from others. Sega NIGHTS looks as though it should be a platform game, but isn't. And id's Quake is hardly just a corridor game. We've done our best to nail each category as best we could. To close the feature we have Chart Track's market breakdown, who've used a slightly different group of categories. We're not trying to confuse you, just that Chart Track's helps represent buying trends better. 47 "


"computer video games * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * FIGHTING GAMES BUTLLETE CHETTICI TUTTE O WHATFIGHTING GAMES ARE ABOUT Easily the most prolific, and continuously exciting area of the computer games industry. Fighting has been popular since the early days -after Data East's Karate Champ the scene has never looked back. As soon as a new style appears in the arcades, the home versions are eagerly awaited. Easily the most successful series is Capcom's Street Fighter, which many players still follow avidly to this day. There have been many games to mimic Street Fighter's style and in some ways improve on the formula. SNK are best known in this respect, with their Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, and King of Fighters series coining it. Sega's Virtua Fighter 3. O WHY FIGHTING GAMES ARE SO POPULAR First and foremost these are the ultimate player-versus player games. With a well balanced fighting game, the argument of who's best is settled quickly and convincingly usually in a best of three rounds scenario, If one player is practiced and the other is still learning, a good fighting game has scope to highlight the gap in no uncertain terms. The development of artificial intelligence is crucial too, as no one wants to find CPU-controlled opponents falling for the same move over and over. It's no surprise that Sega's AM2 chose a fighting game Virtua Fighter 3 to launch their Model 3 arcade board. The detailed representation of two humans, performing complex manoeuvres against each other, surrounded by breathtaking scenery, is the ideal showcase for new technology SNK's King of Fighters 95. 3D FIGHTING 2D FIGHTING BLAGGER'S GUIDE TO COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES Developers are only now finding ways to nail some of the Al problems inherent in 3D fighting games. When you're dealing with motion cap ture routines, as opposed to individual animation frames, perfecting collision points (where fighters take hits) and where to counter attacks is difficult. Which is why even the mighty Virtua Fighter 2. and Tekken 2 are prone to cheap moves however impressive. NOW, though, Virtua Fighter 3 is water tight. And the dodge move soon to feature, in Fighters Megamix along with other VF3 mechanics shows how 3D fighting games have the potential to overshadow the near perfect gameplay of the 2D fighters. Fourteen years down the line since Karate Champ, it's not surprising that the 2D fighting game is now almost faultless in its finest form Street Fighter, King of Fighters. Killer Instinct, Mortal Kombat. There are clear divisions between these styles, meaning there's something to suit all tastes. And because these games are constantly modified to meet the demands of the millions of fans worldwide they are always in vogue. Developers such as Capcom are expert at introducing new, increasingly complex gameplay elements to keep players aim, ing for the top of that learning curve. And the King of Fighters series is a technique masterclass! JEWHERS NEW HERO ALLER PICKY ME AR CADE EUW IT 48 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * "


"* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * computer video games RPGS/ ACTION ADVENTURE O WHATRPGS ARE ABOUT A little hard to define, as the role-playing game (RPG) sector is so fragmented. Simply saying RPG is pretty vague. In Japan there are names to classify all kinds: Action, Simulation, Strategy, and Adventure. Over here we're less well catered for, and ours mainly settle into the Action variety. The basic attraction is the concept of character develop ment strength, speed, intelligence, and magic power against a backdrop of a rich storyline (unheard of in most action games), and exquisite locations. Typically players are in control of one character in an Action RPG, whose actions are, under direct control by the player. However Sega's Shining Force series on Mega Drive and the recent Suikoden from Konami for PlayStation adopt the turn based combat system, which is the most popular in Japan as it allows for more outrageous standard and magic attacks. 1 Final Fantasy VII by Squaresoft. This one game is expected to sell around half a million PlayStations! 090 0 2 O WHY RPGS ARE SO POPULAR Hey hey! You're not closed in the caselo, 001! Co home and gat some sleep! In terms of value for money it's hard to beat a great RPG. Zelda III for the Super NES has over 40 hours of solid gameplay. More recent examples offer more than twice that amount. Losing a chance (missing a life) in an RPG often means losing some of the treasures amassed along the way, so all battles are treated very seriously and are more exciting because of it. Character development is a major part of the reward process with mighty new weapons devastating opponents which may have Kicked your ass' beforehand. RPGs are also renowned for presenting incredible graphics, and amazing! music, which are important for creating the necessary atmosphere. Squaresoft are masters of this, as their forthcoming PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII clearly shows. Get with it UK! 1 The classic Zelda III by Nintendo. Great RPGs offer many hours of involving gameplay. GRAPHIC ADVENTURE BLAGGER'S GUIDE TO COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES O WHAT GRAPHIC ADVENTURES ARE ABOUT EL DESAR RERA te's en Lock at pust Players adopt a more detached role as the character(s) on screen enact various set pieces, using dialogue or items selected for them. Graphic Adventures are the closest thing to an interactive movie available, so it's unsurprising to find that LucasArts are kings of this particular castle. Also known as 'point-n-click' adventures, the routine of using a cursor to prompt the action of a person or item has broad reaching consequences. Given the right item, and/ or the correct choice of conversation the story goes in your favour. Anything less and there's either some kind of on-screen disaster, or nothing at all. The idea is to experiment. Recently Gremlin have been experimenting with 3D expansions on the theme, to some success. Normality works well, and Realms of the Haunting is practically a Doom-style game with point-n-click overtones. 1 Monkey Island II. Brill! Broken word by Revolution, developed for PC andPlayStation. A great success ate last year. O WHY GRAPHIC ADVENTURES ARE SO POPULAR 1 D's, by WARP. Scary! The majority of Graphic Adventures aren't subject to any kind, of time limit. We guess the appeal is down to people being able to solve complex puzzles, with pleasing consequences, at their leisure. Ideal for PC then. In the case of the LucasArts games there is often a lot of great humour incorporated, and as the CD-ROM format allows for studio recordings of voice, actors there's celebrity appeal too Christopher Lloyd in Toonstruck for example.

"computer video games * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * STRATEGY GAMES O WHAT STRATEGY GAMES ARE ABOUT O WHY MANAGEMENT GAMES ARE SO POPULAR O WHY WAR GAMES ARE SO POPULAR Your chance to be a prince among men. with the power over millions! On a more sober level there is the appeal that many War 'Sims' are base on historical battles Napoleonic or even recent times such as the Gulf War. Kind of grim. but it's a selling factor all the same. For the mass market though Command and Conquer's presentation of global war against your mates the increasingly essential network facility makes all the difference. Plus CXC is regarded by experts as one of the best strategy games ever devised and that includes board games such as Rish. For a long time these brainintensive resource management games have been almost exclusive to PC. This is probably due to an older audience. who are patient enough to gain enjoyment from planning for their rewards. Strategy games are pretty much split between war games and sports management titles, but the former are by far the most common. Surprisingly there are some parallels which can be drawn. They all involve starting from scratch with the worst team army imaginable which players must shape up and grow into an unstoppable force. Of course the appeal of each is quite different! Watching your team play badly on a Saturday afternoon can be bloody frustrating. So the opportunity to prove to yourself that you could manage things better is right here. Really it's astonishing how involved players get when every goal counts, and where the accumulation of money through skilful handling of the club's resources can result in the enlisting of the world's star player into Grimethorp Utd. or whatever. We know of somebody who exchanged his Street Fighter addiction for hours dedicated to Championship Manager 2. 1 Civilisation 2, reviewed this issue. 1 Panzer General is a classic from TSR. BLAGGER'S GUIDE TO COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES SIMULATION GAMES WIE AU O WHAT SIMULATION GAMES ARE ABOUT O WHY FLIGHT SIMULATION GAMES ARE SO POPULAR Oh come on, this one's obvious at least that's what you'd think. But 'Sim games range from seatof-the pants flight simulators to viewing entire city networks from afar. The latter can often get confused with management strategy titles but deserve, treating separately for a couple of reasons. So a simulation is exactly what the name suggests, plac ing the player in a 'real' situation which they learn to master then enjoy success. Simulations are. more often than not, open ended which is the clearest distinction you can get between Ace Combat and EF2000: X-Com and Sim City 2000, 'If you wear glasses, you can't become a professional airline pilot or fly a fighter in the RAF. Not in real life. But flight Simula tors allow us to fulfil these incredible dreams, to such a degree that the RAF are reported to use the game EF2000 to train their forces-ves, their game' is so accurate! So the appeal here is pretty universal. The best examples allow users to participate on a number of levels. allowing CPU assistance for novice pilots, and the satisfaction of knowing you could probably fly the real thing given half the chance for those capable to take full control. 1 EF2000 developed by DID. So authentic that the RAF use it to train their fighter pilots. TIME 00'19'52 O WHY SIMULATION GAMES ARE SO POPULAR FEATURE What the Japanese refer to as a Simulation Game is quite different to what we know. They are more, into games where you can raise a Princess, dress her up in fancy clothes and meet the King. as opposed to founding the equivalent of the Roman Empire using hundreds of tiny icons, which is what we tend to go for. In either situation though, the satisfaction comes from watching something wonderful emerge from meagre origins, all thanks to your undivided care and attention. 46 km/h SPEED Pilot Wings 64, for the N64.

"* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * computer video games video PLATFORM GAMES O WHAT PLATFORM O WHY PLATFORM GAMES GAMES ARE ABOUT ARE SO POPULAR 1 Mario 64 on N64. Lead a visually appealing kind of character from A to B. avoiding obstacles and dealing with eneny characters in whichever imaginative way the games designer sees fit. Nintendo's Mario jumps on heads and punches blocks. Sega Sonic spin dashes through walls. Crasi Bandicoot does a bit of both. There are platform shoot'em ups too, in which the central characters are armed with all manner of outra geous weaponry to blow everything away! Platform games fall into the classic Stage Boss' routine, whereby a huge and or complex character awaits the player after they've sur vived the preceding obstacle course. It's taken a while longer for platform games to hop onto the 3D scene, but the results have been worth waiting for Sonic Blast on the Mega Drive is cool, and Mario 64 almost defied description when it was released in June last year. In a way platform games are like huge on going practical puzzles. Some players really go for the colourful, single screen variety made popular by Taito's Bubble Bobble series. Others look forward to more of an amazing quest as recently demonstrated by Crystal Dynamics' Pandemonium. The latter are often accompanied by reviewers saying \"I couldn't wait to see what the next level had in store\". Konami's early Super NES Castlevania and Super Contra (Probotector) are still amaz ing. The Mario games are invariably classics because they combine elements of both. pre, senting tricky bonus screens between the main run and jump action. Above all, though. platform games do very well with the general public because they feature attractive characters or settings Sonic!) and are instantly playable. You don't need to be brilliant in most to have a lot of fun. The Bandicoot! SHOOT EM UPS 'O WHAT3D SHOOTEM UPS ARE ABOUT O WHY 3D SHOOT EM UPS ARE POPULAR BLAGGER'S GUIDE TO COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES Usually these are flight-based games, but, as will be the case with upcoming Star Fox 64. there are ground based missions included. The first popular examples in recent times. outside of the arcade. Mere Star Fox on the Super NES, and Silpneed for Mega-CD. Long before those of course there was Starglider on the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga computers, and Namco's Starblade in the arcade. And after that came Sega's Space Harrier. Thunderblade. Afterburner... the list is pretty huge. Basically the idea is to excite the player with the sensation of flight, and give them an amazing set of weapons to defend themselves against swarms of enemies. 1 Panzer Dragon Zwei developed by Team Andromeda for Sega Saturn. Awesome!!! PLAYSTA 00011600 CONE TO START O ODE TO TRADITIONAL SHOOTEM UPS Dedicated to everyone whose only dream of flying involves carrying a big gun so they can blast everything above and below to smithereens!

In the traditional 2D shoot'em! ups, for example in Galaxian. tiny alien sprites are seen to tumble down screen toward your base' or 'can non. Now with Galaxian 3 in the arcade, these enemies look almost real and fly in formation about your head!

How can this sorti of thrill ever fails CRED. 112 1 CREDIT3 1 Darius Gaiden, from Taito, on Saturn. It's a skilful game featuring great music We're seeing much less of these now outside of the arcade. It's fair to say that they are getting pretty antiquated. much faster than their 2D fighting partners. These used to be the hottest games around from the mid 1980s to early 1990s with games like the R Tipe series, and Raiden Trad. Early last vear Taito updated their popular Darius series for the Saturn and that game is cool — though maybe only to those who loved their shoot 'em ups in the first place. It's extremely difficult to make a great 2D shoot'em up attractive now, as we're all quite used to seeing enormous enemy characters create havoc on screen. Outside of that there's only the almost mathematical appeal of being concentrated enough to weave through cur tains of tiny bullets. Maybe we're all going soft! O HOLD ITI GUN GAMES HAIR Always a popular arcade pass time since Taito's Operation Wolf first appeared. The appeal of this type of game has transformed from solely target practice, to the fact that they now feature some of the best 3D graphics routines around. Sega's Virtua Cop led the way, recently Namco's Time Crisis has added a new dimension with a foot pedal which allows players to duck and cover. These games put YOU right in the centre of the action, and that's what makes them so cool. 51 "

Between times live action movie sequences, often featuring famous actors (Mark Hamill, for example, in Wing Commander III) carry the story along. Of all the games on the market, Space Combat sims offer the highest production values, with development teams such as Origin (Wing Commander, Privateer) bettering Hollywood in some cases. Trading Sims are much less common, probably because they involve building whole universes for pilots to negotiate as opposed to individ ual battle sequences. Elite, its sequels Frontier, and First Encounters give players complete freedom. The Privateer games are half Space Combat, half Trading Sim which seems to be the way this genre is headed. The opportunity to take part in a Star Wars movie is almost too much to resist for some people out there. The fact LucasArts honour this fanaticism with quality software, which appeals to gamers who haven't so much as glanced at C3PO, is a winning situation.

In fact sports games have been around in some form or another since the very first, games systems if you accept that Pong is passable as Tennis. Every Athletic event. every major stadium sport, golf, fishing... almost anything you can think of is now a video game of some description. Tennis and Soccer are the most popular in the UK, with Cricket not far behind. Overseas the likes of Horse Racing and Fresh Water fishing do exceptionally well. It's hard to identify the best ever sports title, as the field is so diverse. But if we are to identify the most popular ever this would have to be Sensible Soccer on the 16-bit home computers and PGA Tour Golf on the PC. FIFA 95 did wonders for the Mega Drive, and Super Tennis for the Super NES is a classic. Competition between two or more players is! the key. The most playable two-player sports games. such as Sensible Soccer, have almost unlimited appeal because players are generally unconcerned about graphical quality.

"computer video games SHOOT 'EM UP BY KONAMI  8 AND 16 BIT PREQUELS AVAILABLE  SATURN VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD FEB RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS TM PlayStation  RELEASED BY KONAMI TEL: 01895 853 000 PlayStation Contra is back! 10 years since the original first exploded into arcades! After wowing us with Mode 7 on Super NES and cool tricks on ritish games players might not be Mega Drive, it's now on PlayStation and in 3D! ritish games players might not be familiar with the Contra brand. Over here the games usually went by the name of Probotector. Remember? Good. Contra 3: The Alien Wars Super Probotector in Blighty is still one of the best games available on the Super NES. Now Konami bring the Contra thrills to the 32-bit machines. Legacy of War is the latest chapter. The aliens are back, and so are the big guns! ONRA ONTRA LETS SEE HOW THESE ALIEN SCUMBAGS FARE AGAINST MY PEN TORCH * WHO YOU GONNA CALL? ** The storyline of the Contra series is simple. Somebody somewhere is doing something they shouldn't be, so the elite 'Contra' force is called in to save the day. The game is set after the Alien Wars and the madness which followed, where a ruthless dictator named Colonel Bassad has plans to take over the world. Just as well, because he wouldn't be much of a ruthless dictator if he didn't have these ambitions. Information has come to light, suggesting that Bassad has come into possession of an alien embryo! The Colonel has managed to breed the embryo, and created an army of alien mutants. Could his domination plans finally succeed? Now it's up to the Contra forces. This time they're calling on the talents of the HARD CORPS a special mobile task force. Can they stop the Colonel before it's too late? SAY HOT, MOTE, HOLDAY III 05 The not very secret Jungle Arcade. R'n'R thrills aplenty! REVIEW Towards the end of level two Jungle Conflict, Konami have included a special treat. It's old school video game thrills ahoy. In the speciallynamed Bamboo Arcade. A good idea it is too. Take a break from the hectic conflict, and unwind. The two games on offer here are updated versions of the originals. The better being Gyrus. One of the first shoot-em ups to feature your craft being able to circle the whole screen. A 360 degree blaster of increasing difficulty. The other, a kind of cross between Tank Battle and Pac-Man, we're not too sure about. It's a strange hybrid which may have appeared under a name like Maze blaster or some thing similar. Best guess is that it's something just made up by the Contra team. Both games pass a few minutes. Once you've finished playing, you can even blow them up! We think the intro is meant to be the HARD CORPS arriving. Who cares, it's got explosions! Tasha took an immediate dislike to Pac-tank. Quite right!  "


"* CATCH US IF YOU CAN * MOTHER OF GOD! * computer video games The HARD CORPS have hand-picked four members from its crack squads. for this awesome task. You can choose to play as any of them. Every Contra game has aliens, and lots of them! Legacy Of War is no different. Colonel Bassad has created a mutant army of thousands to stop you thwarting his plans. He's also positioned robot sentries, missile launchers and of course Bosses. The deployment of the bosses is quite cunning. On some stages you think you've defeated the boss, only to be confronted by another. The Colonel has been a little careless in his scheming. Hidden on each level are rooms stashed full of power-up booty. Make sure you shoot everything to discover these secrets as you will definitely need them. PlayStation BUBBA TASHA Lots of mutant soldiers jump out of this floating disc. It must be like the Tardis because it looks so small! Po An alien who can communicate in our language. Bubba has fought for the Terrans since before the Alien Wars. Little else is known about him. A former soldier-for-hire. Tasha doesn't have a sense of humour. Swift, silent and deadly. She favours heavy firepower, because she enjoys the explosions. CD-288 RAY 1 A very ugly spider with a huge mutant head. Those konami guys are weird! By far our favourite boss.

WE'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER KW RNATIV V V ONTRA A huge pile of something! Home of this snake-like hydra beast. Toast him! We don't want to hurt the tortoise mummy. Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to. You see it's war, them or us! Each character starts each stage with the same basic weapon. A machine gun. Throughout the stage power-ups can be obtained by finding Falcon symbols. There are three different colour Falcons to be found. Each colour activates a different weapon, depending on who you're playing as. KOMAMI. AND FINAL POWER UP RAY TASHA REVIEWER We'll just quickly mention that the PlayStation version of Contra has a special 3D mode. We can't really say how good this is because we couldn't seem to get it to work properly. It involves wearing those glasses with red and blue lenses. and fiddling with the brightness and colour controls on the TV. It might work. but we can't see it adding a great deal to the game anyway. Alright. BLUE FALCON SPREAD GUN SPARKLING LASER RED FALCON HOMING LASER SEEKING BULLETS Contra 3 was one of my favourite games on the SNES. Upon first play this 32-bit version left me in a bit of a shock. Where were the great colourful graphics, the imaginative bosses, and the really big guns. After the disappointment subsided I realised all these things which made Contra great were actually still here. Maybe I was expecting more. That's the real problem, when you attach a famous name to your game. It has to be really amazing to please peo ple. Legacy of War is an above average game, but when you attach the Contra name it seems worse than it really is. For best enjoyment out of this title, just forget it's a Contra game. Instead just enjoy it for the shoot-em up action it provides ALEX HUTHALA POWER UP CD-288 BUBBA TE BLUE FALCON SPREAD GRENADE STRAIGHT LASER O MIAST RATING A bit of a disappointment for the hardcore Contra fans. It's still a decent shoot-em up, but not one worthy of that name. RED FALCON HOVING MISSILE NOMING BULLETS 59 "

Terranigma a cool new RPG TERRANIGMA erra the earth. Enigma a mystery. Terranigma a cool new RPG from the publishers of Illusion of Time in which the aim is to restore the earth's balance. But how? Well, with enough strength and courage, together with a head for problem solving, the hero of this game stands a pretty good chance. Terranigma is all about discovery through survival. By choosing the right tool or weapon, and by protecting the main character with the relevant armour, players gradually learn the strategy to beating the game. But, as with all Super NES RPGs, the process takes a long, long time. Terranigma starts basic, but evolves into something complex and quite amazing. Though it's an action-based title, there is a fair amount of strategic thinking involved along the way, not forgetting some minor detective work. And as it's from Enix, quality is assured. FIGHTING FOR THE WORLD Let's start with the hero all fired up and ready to go. Very! early on it is learned that the young feller has been causing all kinds of distress around his home village. It's this kind of mischief which initiates the wide-ranging series of events which take place in Terranigma. After helping a group of friends smash down a locked door, he discovers an ancient and mysterious box in the room beyond. Once opened, this box causes a disruption in time and space, and unlocks a doorway to another dimension.

It is a strange 52/79 REVIEW Soon as the box is opened, an odd little winged creature appears. This is Yomi. who is your quartermaster for the expedition. Inside the box is a magical store, in which the hero stashes his inventory — ranging from weapons and armour. to food and medicine. In here there is also a record book. So the hero can check on his statistics, and reference guides which explain how to perform important techniques.

These are accepted currency in every shop which sells magic items, purveyors of enchanted rings and the like. As magic is so potent, obtaining these crystals can sometimes be quite difficult but the extra effort is worth it. Other easier to come by currency is gained by defeating enemies.

REVIEWER BEFORE THE BIGGER PICTURE Your aim is to restore life to a dying planet. Initially there isn't any signs of land to support anything other than fish, so the first task is to raise the continents. Five towers exist on the 'Outside'. By reaching the top, and challenging the master in each, the hero succeeds in restoring one piece of land. But this sequence, however tricky it may seem at first, is only the small beginnings of the main quest. With the continents intact, it then becomes the hero's duty to encourage the return of vegetation, animal, and human life. After that it becomes necessary to manage their progress successfully even going so far as to appoint Mayors for cities! All the while, the evil forces must be kept at bay by the hero's bravery and skill. Only when the earth has been restored and evil banished can the game truly end. What you see initially with Terranigma is only a fraction of what you get in the end, and it's impossible to predict the series of extraordinary events which take place. Control over the main character is excellent the player is able to experiment with impressive alternate techniques, instead of being limited to one or two predictable ones. Quintet always include a sense of drama and intrigue to their games. Their artwork is stunning, and their music is invariably fantastic. So when you find yourself in a new location, the full effect is really awesome. It's commendable that Quintet have a talent for plot development too. Where a game so huge as Terranigma could become a tedious succession of rigid routines, instead the storyline makes the whole experience exciting from beginning to end. Many of you should be pleased to know that for a skilled action player the rewards could be even greater than for someone who's just struggling through. A well-balanced, with a powerful message. PAW DAVIES REVIEW 1 A sequence similar to this is shown each time an area of land is resurrected. RATING An outstanding addition to the Super NES' library of attractive RPG-style adventures. Superb presentation, and great story telling. 61 "

"computer Video games HOW TO PICK A FIGHT! The combat system is very simple: Each unit has a set amount of moves per turn, and each civilization takes it in turns to move their units. To engage in combat, move one of your units onto a square occupied by the enemy. They will now both battle for the possession of that square. Each unit is given firepower, defence and hit points. A unit with greater firepower to the opponent's defence and hit points is likely to win the battle. However there are a number of factors that may change this outcome. A unit being attacked may be in a fortified position, which will increase their defensive score. The terrain the battle is on (such as forest or mountain) can also affect the battle. MUCHO SCENARIOS AMIGOS! The twenty new scenarios on offer here, provide a wealth of new challenges. 12 have been devised by MicroProse themselves. The other 8 have been labelled 'Best of the Net'.

Now just as players might be getting slightly bored with it along comes the perfect expansion disk. Conflicts in Civilization makes the original game 20 times better. Each of these scenarios offer a great new challenge with their unique new strategies and goals. The historical conflicts are as accurate as possible within the constraints of the Civilization format. The real joy here is the 'What If?' possibility of each scenario. Could you plan better than Napoleon? Or defeat the Federals in the American civil war, changing the course of history? The futuristic scenarios are a great addi tion. The amount of new units in these two games possibly could have warranted a separate release. The only negative point I can make is that all these scenarios are based on conflicts. Hopefully a future disc will have scenarios based around trade and peace.

COLLECTING BONUSES ast month we showed first pictures of this Saturn conversion of Tempest 2000. Now it's ready for review! If your response to that is \"So what?\" perhaps we'd better re-educate you on what Tempest 2000 is. A powered-up version of Atari's fantastically unique vintage coinop, it's the work of veteran gaming legend Jeff Minter, and has been the sole essential reason to own an Atari Jaguar. More specifically, it's one of the greatest games ever made ever! What we like to refer to as a gaming staple. And with this conversion comes the chance for a whole new arena of gamers to discover its power. Providing, that is, the conversion makes the grade. So, does it? TEMPEST 2000 The bonus tubes randomly appear when baddies are shot. Spotting their appearance and intercepting them is essential. The first one releases a rapid fire particle laser, the next gives 2000 points. Then jump ability is provided, an Al droid and finally a warp bonus the objective of every level. 21380 PARISCUS PART 2: THE GRAPHICS ****o090 PART 1: THE GAMEPLAY! Tempest 2000's primary strength is its super-charged gameplay. At the heart of it all is a simple shoot 'em up prevent aliens reaching your end of a 3D tunnel but as with all great blasters it has amazing depth. The drive to get through all 99 levels proves amazingly addictive. And cracking the last highscore is everything! TEMPEST 2000 Arcade Tempest is memorable for its superstylish vector graphics, thrilling displayed in Quadrascan Color (whatever that was). Rather than losing this trademark look, Jeff Minter boosted it with what he called Melt-OVision(TM). Explosions of coloured particles and swirling oily effects do indeed melt all over the screen. This look was designed with the Jaguar hardware in mind, so replicating it on Saturn was never going to be easy. The result closely matches the Jag original, but to a fan's eye there's a lot missing. Less particles and drabber vector frames take some of the mesmerising thrill out of the game's look. Clockwise from left, the laser and jump, Al-droid and a warp token! REVIEWER The first enemy flippers provide little problem they can't even hurt you upon reaching the top, providing you don't move when shooting. 173004 Mastering control of the 'Claw' is tricky enough to start. Novices find the left and right steering confusing when upside down. Later baddies like fuseballs electrocute you. Pulsars scuttle lethally around the rim. Demonheads fire off their horns. The tougher they are, the more points they yield. I bought a Jaguar (when they were 41565 around ) solely for Tempest 2000. Excessive perhaps, but it's an incredible game and one which I never expected to see released on any other format. However, when I saw the preproduction Saturn version last month it looked incredibly promising. Now it's finished though, it still looks only promising. High Voltage have done an admirable job trying to replicate everything, but this is a game that showcased the Jaguar, and on Saturn everything seems diminished. 140360 289281 There's less splattery particles and showy effects, the music and sounds are less dynamic, the bonus stages have lost their mesmerising appeal and some of the gameplay is affected the spikes and fuseballs are annoyingly indestructible. My complaints may seem petty, but PART 3: THE BONUS STAGE any Tempest 2000 fan will understand how minutely perfect the Jag version is Gaining access to the bonus stages is THE it's the tiniest details that make the main fix of Tempest 2000.

Surely PlayStation owners want a conversion of the acclaimed Jaguar Tempest 2000. Yeh, but why have cotton when you can have silk? MORER WARF TEMPEST) MEANWHILE... IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE! Tempest 2000's Melt-O-Vision (TM) graphics famously demonstrated the Jaguar's strength at generating multitudes of phosphorescent particles and warpy visuals. Without the same custom hardware, these effects would be difficult to recreate. So High Voltage have made use of different, but equally impressive effects that the PlayStation is good at. Namely, transparency and light-sourcing. Shimmering panels now adorn the walls on each stage, your blaster now fires coloured streamers that illuminate the tunnel, new tracer effects bleed off the edges of things, and the exploding messages now fade on and off. Compare these pictures to the ones on the other page. It's different, but we reckon it's far better suited to the PS and what's more we like it! 163438 120289 102605 n the page to the left you can see Tempest 2000 on Saturn. And at the bottom of that page you can see the score three. Not a bad score by any means, but surely disappointing for a game universally acclaimed as one of the best ever. A poor conversion perhaps? Or maybe the game was never meant to appear on anything except Jaguar. After all, it was designed for that console's custom hardware. Any other games machine would have to mimmick what the Jaguar does naturally. Unless, the game was redesigned to make use of the other machine's hardware. Yeh, imagine what Tempest 2000 would look like if it had been created for the PlayStation. You've imagined Tempest X! ARTICLE LASER 126532 299. ORDI TEMPEST X BLEU The visual effects are more dazzling the ever. The hypnotic brilliance of the original is lost, but it's still thrilling! Check out the oily shell effect on the Web's walls. That shimmer-effect glistens as you move around. Tastelessly, gratuitously blinding! REVIEWER ALL-NEW LEVELS The new look obviously inspired High Voltage to tamper with the game design too. New stages, instantly noticeable to the veteran Tempest 2000 fan, scatter the game. Fortunately, they haven't just been mindlessly created. Some are bizarrely interesting, reversing the controls by placing you on the outside edge of the rim. One (shaped like a figure-eight) actually curves inside-out. Very disorienting! A NEW WEAPON Collecting bonus tubes is the key to power-ups. With Tempest X though, there's an extra power-up to be had even after the Bonus Warp. Continue collecting tubes and you get the Mega-Droid. In other words your Al Droid acquires a rapid-fire laser. You don't get it for long though, because with such power you soon clear the level! 9150 When I first saw pictures of Tempest XI was mortified at the idea of tampering with Jeff Minter's original. The style of Jaguar Tempest 2000 is fantastic! However, upon experiencing TX I couldn't help but be daz. zled. The new effects are mind-blowing. Not as stylish, but fresh and better-suited to PlayStation. More importantly, the gameplay is still top-notch. It's fast, brilliantly responsive and totally addicitve. There are a few niggles sometimes the graphics are too dazzling to see through (T2000's are mad, but always functional). and the remixed music is naffer. Also, the tampering to the bonus stages has left them less hypnotic than before. But then Jaguar T2000 is perfect, and even with these defects Tempest X is a exceptional blaster. It's like a '96 dance remix of on old rave hardcore classic! I want it! TOM GUISE 21408 2000COLL REVIEW PARTIBLE LASER WHAT OF THE SOUND? ETVE RATING ENF New baddies appear too. One splits open to release tons of flippers! Tempest X's music is the same as Saturn T2000's. Remixes that pale in comparison to the Jag originals. However, this is made up for by all-new sound-effects. Some are particularly chilling such as an egg-cracking noise as two enemies split. It's all pumped up and loud t. One complaint we have of both the Saturn and PS sounds though, is that you can't adjust them mid-game. While some of the monster new effects are tackier and detract from Tempest 2000's perfection, this definitely isn't a step back. A thrillingly fresh rework of a classic! 8 65 "

Coming from the creators of Rage Racer and Tekken 2, you'd expect it to be an epic tennis confrontation between two muscular tennis warlords with ridiculous hairstyles each performing volleys that turn the ball into a dragon-shaped fireball of death. All accompanied by bangin' techno tunes. And it would be called Rave Court Tennis! But no. As fans of Super NES Smash Tennis know, you couldn't ask for a cuter tennis game. Cue baby-faced cherubs punting the ball about while elevator music tinkles away. Hey these people invented Pac-Man and Mappy too, you know! VASTCOURT TM LOOKS SMASHINGI SWING THAT RACKETI TOO PlayStation Smash Court looks very similar to its Super NES counterpart, albeit much more polished. Viewed from the standard pseudo-3D top down angle first seen in Super Tennis, it's very bright and cartoony. Of course, it wouldn't be a PlayStation title if it didn't have a few polygons in it. Surprisingly though, the backdrops are flat, but the characters are 3D generated. There doesn't seem to be a lot of reason for this, except that they can react to getting hit in various bodily regions including the nuts, which is accompanied by a comedy tuning fork twang! There are four different types of swing you can execute when whacking the ball in any direction. The Normal Shot fires the ball at standard power and is easy to pull off. The Strong Shot adds more speed. The Lob is good for tucking the ball up into the air when close to the net. However, the Super Shot is the one to master. It's slow to pull off, so you have to time it very carefully. Succeed though and it powers the ball at incredible speed, complete with a trail! Performing a Super Serve is exceptionally tough to pull off! TO MEET THE GANGI Smash Court surely features the most characters of any Namco game (even Tekken 2). There are 24 different players to choose from, or face. Although none seem to have different performance attributes from any other, they all have individual hairstyles, outfits and names. You can face the likes of Carlos, Hideo, Naomi, Nisha or even Boris and Steffi. Although, Boris sports a hairstyle closer to that of Paul Phoenix from Tekken. . REVIEW The cute-style of the graphics is very similar to the SNES's. Those people are 3D though! A selection of cutesy Smash Court tennis stars. They feature little details such as being left-or-right handed. That guy on the right has been knocked in the gonads. 66 "


"COURT IN THE ACTI computer video games . PlayStation In general, Tennis games (or most sports games for that matter) are renowned for having a lack of background variety. After all, what can you do with a tennis court, eh? Well, quite a lot it would seem, if your name is Senor Namco. Smash Court Tennis has ten different tennis courts to play on, each with their own unique look. There are five international Namcourts Tokyo, USA, France, Australia and England, each resembling their real-life counterparts (England, for example looks a lot like Wimbledon), but with added Namco branding such as Pacman or Mappy on the surface. The other five courts are even more scenic. Set in lovely holiday locations with names like 'I Love Tahiti' and \"Magic Thailand', they even come with hula-hula girls or Royal umpires (on thrones). And there's little comedy touches such as whacking your ball off the cliff into the Aegean sea! This clever collage is supposed to fit together like one big tennis court. Of course, it looks nothing like that. Can you identify Tahiti, a Greek island, a medieval castle, Canada, Thailand, England, USA and France?

Collection Mode invites you to play against various opponents and choose a prize should you win. There are tons of bizarre items to collect, such as Pacman umpires, bamboo huts, autumn leaves, swimming pools, the Umpire's cat and pine trees. When you start, you are given your own sparse tennis court which you can decorate with all the prizes won. You can then edit your court at will, moving stuff about or getting rid of it.

No Nazis. No World War Two. No wonder, then, that shortly after the war a scientist decides to rewrite the history books and travel back in time to 1928, where he discreetly removes Hitler from the spacetime continuum before he has a chance to change the world and cause so much suffering. HITTA You don't get many strategy games selling over a million copies worldwide, but Westwood did it with Command and Conquer. if Hitler had never come to power Can they do it again with the sequel? COMMAND CONQUER REPARERT ENDATU With Hitler gone, the future should be a peaceful and idyllic place, but the scientist's Grace meddling has unforeseen consequences. With no common foe to unite against, the forces of East and West are thrown together in a massive armed struggle. The Communist dictator, Josef Stalin, plans to conquer Europe and annexe the whole continent with Russia to form one world-dominating empire. Standing in his way is an allied force made up of the surviving remnants of the European armies, backed up by an American contingent. With so much at stake, this is a bitter and hard-fought war which still rages in the present day, with devastating modern weapons and incredible new technologies. The Russians have fought their way as far Germany, and Greece is about to fall. As a senior field commander, you could make the difference between desperate defeat and glorious victory. The only question is, whose side are you on? GOOD GUYS VS BAD GUYS At the start of the campaign you get the option of fighting on the side of the Allies the good guys or the Russians, who are depicted as baby-eating murderers. The Allied commanders are represented in the FMV clips by two concerned-looking generals and a spunky special operative called Tanya Adams. Meanwhile the Russians are represented by Crazy Joe Stalin, who is apparently knocking off his comely commandantette while overseeing nerve gas tests on women and children. Of course, missions also differ depending on which side you're on. Russian commanders are ruthless, and most of their time is spent mercilessly stamping out opposing forces and executing any who stand in their way. If you join the Allies, you'll find yourself leading rescue missions or working with other forces to secure a common goal. Both sides also use different technology the Allies rely on more conventional artillery and airpower while the Russians are developing new electrical superweapons. Also, their armies are organised differently. For example, the Russians don't train any field medics, so their soldiers usually end up fighting to the death. MISSION: A BIT TRICKY Playing Red Alert isn't just a matter of taking on one samey scenario after another. There are over 40 missions to play out, every one with its own unique plot and objectives, and occasionally you can even select one of two possible missions and thus change your route through the game. Some missions are short sorties, others prolonged battles, but in all of them you have to plan your actions carefully. If you're supposed to be blowing up a series of bridges make sure you don't demolish them in the wrong order and trap yourself on the wrong side of a river. If you find an enemy base, try to neutralise its defences by attacking its power plants first. Then maybe you can capture it to use for your own gain. And if you come across captured personnel, try to rescue them and they will assist you. By way of demonstration, here's the first Allied mission played out. A small force, including special agent Tanya Adams, has to rescue Professor Albert Einstein from captivity in a Russian base. The base is guarded by Tesla coils, which launch deadly charges of electricity at any enemy force that comes within range. Getting past those is going to need some thought.

"PLAYING BASE FIGHT AMONGST YOURSELVES computer Video games Rather than being simple raids, some missions require you to construct and defend a base of operations, then use that to build a force strong enough to kick the enemy off the map. Every base starts off with a Construction Yard that builds essential structures like an ore refinery and power plant. Once you have these you can move on to more specialised facilities that train troops or build tanks. Everything takes time to construct, though, and if you run out of ore your produc tion line will grind to a halt. This pic shows what a typical Allied base looks like in one of the early missions. As the campaign progresses, extra equipment, such as helipads, submarine pens and high-tech weapon installations become available. ROM Game options abound on the multiplayer set-up screen. Red Alert has several multi-player modes that let you fight it out with other players over an IPX network, a serial link (a cable or a modem there's a second CD supplied for your opponent if you want to play this way) or the Internet. The serial and Internet games are for two players, but the IPX game lets up to eight people invade each other's territory, form alliances and just, you know, generally compete for world domination. The Internet game is only available if you're running Windows 95 and already have an Internet connection. The Red Alert CD then installs all the software you need to register your copy of the game and log on to Westwood's game server which has chat rooms and lets you set up battles with whoever else is on-line at the time. een Sezna 650Exotic weapons become available earlier in this mode. COMMENT If there's anyone out there who STILL hasin't got into Command & Conquer even after the recent console releases and this new PC version, SORT IT OUT! You're missing out on something really special! Not only is Red Alert brilliant in 1-player mode, with great FMV scenes getting the plot going, but it's one of the best multi-player games ever! With 2-players it's fantastic, but it gets even better with more and the internet mode gives nearly everyone the chance to try it out! While it may look like an impossibly complex game, anyone can get into it and with time become a master warmonger!

Last year everyone was banging on about how good command and Conquer was but I just never got around to playing it. \"Strategy game?\" I said, «Nahh...» Now I've seen Red Alert, though, I'm of a mind to rummage through the bargain bins to try and find a copy, because if it's any thing like this it's got to be a work of lovely genius. The storyline is inspired, and I especially liked the way Westwood differentiated between the two forces one weak but more thoughtful, the other strong but insanely dangerous. It all adds to the drama. The intrigue and the sinister plots that come to light during the campaign and the problem-solving situations that crop up during the missions themselves are all fascinating, and help place, Red Alert a long way from those hex-grid snoozathons that used to pass for strategy games. All this, combined with the simple interface, the smart cut-scenes and the breadth of battlezone action make this a game that everyone should try.

While most of the game's play field is viewed in an isometric perspective, occasionally you'll wish you could choose another angle. Here Climax have been very clever. The 'Hyperion Perspective' is a device which allows you to twist the angle of view, basically meaning you can look around in almost any direction! This is extremely useful for looking behind objects. Or when Garian is obscured by an object in the foreground, all you need to do is change the perspective. By holding the Left shoulder button and direction pad, you can look around, while the Right shoulder button allows you to scroll the view. It's essential that you master this feature, because you're gonna need it later in the game! SEGA SATURN There is a stone with Keyhole l'here 15 writing etched in W YOU'VE ONLY GOT ONE LIFE TO LIVE!

Sometimes Garian may miss a jump across a platform, which is where the points come in handy. Jack, the bird which accompanies Garian, retrieves him for 20 points.

"SSSSSSSSSSMO computer video games WOT WUNS BETTERER VEN? NBA Jam Extreme is being released on the Saturn and PlayStation the PS version is very similar to the arcade original, while the Saturn version suffers slightly with grainy translucency and slightly blockier graphics. As usual, they both play exactly the same. In previous NBA Jam games, scoring three dunks in a row would set your player \"On Fire!\". In Extreme, players become \"Smokin'\", and get covered in flames as well as having infinite Turbo power for a while! You can also become Smokin' by blocking three shots in a row, and by powering-up both ways you become \"Ultimate!\". Ilay'lation Maybation The PlayStation game has translucent backboards and is nice and smooth. The Saturn version is a bit blockier and jerkier, but plays just the same.

With the new 3D graphics engine, the view can zoom out to make everything look even more extreme! NBA JAM EXTREME Here, the view zooms out to keep the flying player on the screen! The net bends right down until it's nearly touching the floor! POLIET: REVIEWER SH After a good dunk, your player will occasionally do a little dance for you! I enjoy the NBA Jam games, though I wasn't all that keen on the new features of the last one NBA Jam: Tournament Edition. I get the original version out every now and then for 4-player games, but that's just been replaced with Extreme! Everything that was fun about the old games has been enhanced here: bigger heads, more characters, faster gameplay, more over-the-top dunks, more stupid quotes, and some good 3D graphics. It's lots of fun in multi-player mode, and with a memory card you can save your records from each game, giving you something to work on. It's more of a fun party game which will be played a few times a week than something you'll play non-stop but if you're likely to get multi-player games going regularly, it's well worth getting. MARV'S IN THE HOUSE G UDMU The old voice of NBA Jam has gone, only to be replaced with \"real\" NBA commentator Marv Albert! He's also done the commentary for a few other video games, including Sega's NHL All-Stars and NBA Action on the Saturn. As an added bonus, Marv is included in one of the secret celebrity teams in NBA Jam Extreme, so you can now play as everyone's cheerful hero! REVIEW 8 \\A$ RATING By switching through all of the Chicago Bulls players, Dennis Rodman's hair will change colour each time! Just like the real thing! A great upgrade of the NBA Jam series, and a lot of fun in multi-player mode. It's not so hot with only one person, however. Get some friends. 73 "

So LOADED oaded was a big hit of last year. So not surprisingly here comes the inevitable sequel. Rather than just tweak' the original, Gremlin have redesigned the whole game. Gone is F.U.B the Fat Ugly Boy of the prequel. In his place is C.H.E.B Charming Handsome Erudite B*****d! The story goes that F.U.B's brain pod managed to escape before his defeat. This brain pod has been undergoing it's very own star trek, looking for a new host body. Eventually the pod finds a host, on a desolate planet populated by artists and hippies. Now in the body of a former artist, C.H.E.B is born. Yes, he wants world domination. Who wouldn't? 2000 WE ARE FAMILY RELOADED In the original Loaded the lunatics were taking over the asylum. They eventually broke free, although not all of them made the journey to the sequel. All the old characters have undergone a bit of a facelift, courtesy of 2000AD artist Jason Brashill. Sadly missing is Vox, the very voluptuous babe from the first game. Apparently she has started a career in glamour photography. There are two new characters to make amends for her departure. WE WANNA BE FREE LADER They don't really want to be 'free' they want to be three, or 3D to be more precise. Rendered as well, and in full FMV glory. They can't be like this in the game.

"computer video games TURN THE BEAT AROUND Loaded was criticised for being more than a bit repetitive. All you had to do was collect various coloured keys on each level. The keys collected in order would allow you to reach other areas within the maze-like level, until you reached the exit. Gremlin have put their thinking caps on, and changed the game play to a certain extent. Now each mission (they're no longer levels) has you collecting different objects. Yes it's still a little similar, but where the original Loaded all took place in the asylum, Reloaded's missions are all over the place, taking in such exotic locations as the hippy planet, military installations and city rooftops.

Collect enough and he will build you a bridge to the next level. If his guitar annoys you, shoot him! I KNOW NOW WHY YOU CRY Another major change is the opportunity to befriend the enemy. Yes, you heard right. Gremlin apparently had a change of heart while creating the game, deciding that mindless killing was, well mindless. So now if you pay attention to the enemy before killing them, you might just hear their cries for help. Upon finding such softies you can now chat to them. Some will talk tripe, so don't pack away your weapon too quickly. Others reveal clues on how to complete the level. So now Reloaded contains an all important lesson. Who said video games don't teach you anything? Shoot, kill, maim, destroy, pillage, explode, torture, mow down like a stinking pig, toast, burn, flambe, frappe, souffle! RELOADED REVIEWER DROUINNS SCHROUS AT FRUMORS BRF COME GET ME I wasn't a huge fan of the original Loaded. Yes the graphics looked nice at the time, but the game play was just too boring. Gremlin have to be congratulated for trying to reinvent the game. Unfortunately not all is rosie. The clarity and animation of the main characters is appalling, no excuses. If the game play was great, admittedly this wouldn't matter. It isn't great however, and is surprisingly similar to the original. In many ways worse. All I can think of when playing the game is \"it's not finished yet\". Possibly the game was rushed to reach the shops in time for Christmas? Even the Pop Will Eat Itself tunes of the original are gone, and the new tracks don't really create much excitement. This could have been, should have been, much, much better. I'm sorry Gremlin but you've let a lot of people down. Alex 4UATALA REVIEW RATING May please the psycho fans of the original, but there's nothing new here to appeal to everybody else. Just like the original it's too laborious. 75 "

By far the most original feature of ITZ 2 is the option to view the national anthems being sung.

Yeeahhh Boyee! NBA PLAYOF REVIEWER 25 Sau'S (S) Basketball games are often criticised for being great to look at, but a little boring to play. The trouble being the nature of the game itself admittedly it is repetitive. If you're a fan this criticism doesn't mean diddly, and with In The Zone 2 you're going to find yourself in seventh heaven. This game goes for realism, and to a certain degree does pull it off. The wealth of moves and plays is the most comprehensive I've ever seen. That fact alone should make you realise the potential of this game. The only criticism I have is that at times you don't quite feel in control of the players. For example a player who you want to pass will suddenly try a three pointer usually missing! However if you stick with the game this problem becomes less apparent. Hats off to Konami, as they've improved on the already great original. If you love basketball, get this.

"computer video games NINTENDO 64 FIGHTING BY RARE 600 KILLER INSTINCT GOLD  PRICE SIMPORT NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE  FORMAT: 96 MEG CART PUBLISHED BY: NINTENDO  TEL: IMPORTERS OUT NOW (US) 1-2 PLAYERS 62 LANUS 2 NRGOS TURS FULGORK MAUA he first part of this review needs only to say that all Killer Instinct 2 arcade fans should buy Killer Instinct Gold straight away. With everything from the arcade game (except for quite a lot of animation frames) plus lots more, it's essential to those who already like kl. My favourite feature of SNES Killer Instinct was the training mode, and Ki Gold has some of the best training features yet even rewarding those who master it with new costumes. As a fighting game, KI Gold doesn't flow very well at all each fight is a series of attempted enormous combos, breaking the whole thing up. Standard moves, and even fireballs are very rarely needed, meaning that it takes quite a bit of practice before you can do a decent combo in a fight. The main character graphics aren't too hot missing animation from the arcade, with the Nintendo 64's strange fuzzy antialiasing effect making the fighters look a bit rough when the view zooms in close, but the 3D backgrounds are excellent a lot better than the arcade version. Overall, Killer Instinct Gold certainly isn't a game for anyone less than a big fighting game fan, and a fighting game fan with patience at that. ED LOMAS HITS 11 % NINTENDO 64 RACING GAME ELAPSED 09 CRUIS'N USA TIME SO OUT NOW (USA) towe BY WILLIAMS 1-2 PLAYERS ith our PlayStation half-melted after exhaustive Rage Racer sessions, Cruis'n USA has a lot to prove. And it has proved that a great machine is capable of supporting poor software. From beginning to end, in almost every respect Cruis'n USA is a mistake for N64. The only redeeming feature is that it closely resembles the look and gameplay of the arcade machine which isn't great. Cruis'n comes across as a poorly revised version of the classic Outrun, minus the great tunes and thrills. I haven't heard music as bad as this... anywhere! And it's hard staying awake through the 14 tedious stretches of US highway. It is so boring. Control with the analogue stick is good. The two-player mode isn't bad.

"computer video games UWARRIOR WRESTLING BO maysouton\" WWF IN YOUR HOUSE PlayStation JAN RELEASE BY SCULPTURED 1-2 PLAYERS WF In Your House is based on the WWF Wrestlemania coin-op which was released last year. Somehow, the graphics have gone drastically downhill from the original PS version, and the fighters look'as though they've been digitised from a poor quality video they're all fuzzy and jerky. The backgrounds are now more varied, as each wrestler has their own arena, but they all look rubbish as well, with comedy digitised spectators to add to the mess. There are now power-ups in the ring, and there are a few new fighters (including the Ultimate Warrior!) but the overall game is a lot less impressive than the first, and doesn't have the novelty of being a Midway coin-op conversion. Unfortunately, even though it's funny, it stinks.

Occasionally, you'll find a nice one. Slam Tilt falls into the latter category. It's pretty good. Four tables are on offer. Mean Machines a car-based table. The Pirate-based around pirates, doh. Ace of Space science fiction related adventures, and Night of the Demon a horror themed table. Only one of these tables is too easy, with the Pirate being the most fun. The logic of the pinball itself is very good. Bouncing off bumpers at the right angles and speed. Four tables might not seem a lot, especially with titles like Pinball Constructors Kit doing the rounds. But these tables are fairly imaginative, and accurately convey the quality of the modern pinball table. This means you get all those fancy little dot-matrix displayed sub-games. One final point, the metallic clang the ball makes is really excellent. If you like pinball, you'll enjoy this.

It's also a decent 'lesser' beat 'em up. Lesser meaning there are a lot of better fighters on the market. It's the old story of good versus evil. Or here order versus chaos. What Iron & Blood does offer is a game full of differences. The presentation throughout is clever, eg. your fighter's life force is represented by a burning flame. There are 16 fighters to chose from. Being a D&D game, there are guys with big swords, goblins and dwarves to choose from. What is neat is the ability to improve your fighter through experience, and the gaining of artifacts. These artifacts improve your character's magical powers, giving the game a little RPG appeal. This game may look unappealing at first, but give it time and there is some fun to be had. Not the best beat 'em up around, but not bad either. ALEX HUHTALA  PRICE C22.99  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED .

You now get to create a gym in which you can save eight of your home-made fighters (each gym takes up one card slot), and you have a promoter to organise fights for you. The control system doesn't work quite as well on the PlayStation pad as it did on the Saturn, but the improved speed and new features (including being able to take your boxer to a friend's house for a fight) make it better overall.

"computer Video games OWN THE ULTIMATE GAMES MACHINE! ROM What's the most powerful games machine on the market at the moment? Saturn? PlayStation? Nintendo 64, surely? Well, in a for AN ETKENLERE WHERE TO BUY.. ver the past few months prices for Pentium PCs have come crashing down so if you're after the most versatile, graphically astounding machine around, there's only one serious choice. As Rich Leadbetter reveals... We all know what the advantages of the PC over the consoles are: it's upgradable (you can change bits and pieces of your system to suit you), it can access the Internet easily, it can do spreadsheets and word processing, you can even program it. It also has some of the most astounding titles videogame behemoths that the superconsoles just can't handle. It also has a fair smattering of the games that ARE available on console and they're usually a whole lot better. This feature presumes that you have between ,000 and ,500 to spend on a PC. At the lower price range you can expect to get a 120MHz Pentium with 16 megs of RAM, eight-speed CD-ROM (four times faster than Saturn or PlayStation's), hard drive, floppy drive everything. You're looking at much the same spec for outlaying ,500 but with a top-end CPU to make everything whizz by at top speed. Everyone's selling PCs at the moment since it mine recently bought a Pentium Pro system is the boom market (over 70% of all games (180 MHz!) for ,500. Where did he get sold are on PC). However, we recommend that this? From Gateway directly. I consider this a you avoid the high street multiples like true Masters' deal and before I heard this ! Dixons, Toys 'R Us and what-have-you. would have valued that particular system at Although their machines are good, their prices least ,000! are not so good. Instead, phone up suppliers Don't be afraid to haggle, get the lowest price like Dell or Gateway direct and ask for the and phone around again quoting that price best spec in your budget. Just to give you and watch the companies fight it out for your some ballpark figure to aim at, a friend of cash. Save lots of dosh just by asking! 18 MONTHS LATER IT'S OUTDATED!\" The one trap with buying a PC will stop, but I can't see it hapbelieved possible. is that typically within 18 pening for years. Even if this doesn't happen, months something's on the However, I think that for games and instead you're going to market that's about three rather than upgrading your CPU keep on upgrading your CPU times more powerful than your (the most expensive bit), (and usually the motherboard system and costs exactly what instead people will be going for as well) it usually costs you paid for your machine! video card upgrades built espearound  to buy the latest, There's very little you can do cially to work with 3D. It's hap greatest processor. Typically, about this, because it's Intel's pening now with two major 3D the rest of your system main way to leech tons of cash cards available in the US shouldn't need to change out of the market. Sooner or which take 3D performance to the sound card and memory later people will get wise and it levels you'd never have are future-proof. BUILD IT OR BUY IT? Open up a PC and you see that everything is in component form. A motherboard is at the base of everything and therein you plug the Pentium CPU and memory. From there you plug in your drives, sound card and graphics card. Because it's all modular, you can upgrade each bit as you please. That begs the question, should you buy your PC complete or assemble it? The main advantage with assembling it yourself is that you save at least a couple of hundred quid, but it's not a task for the technically inept. Although pretty simple, if you're not up on your polarities and voltages, you're in deep trouble. So buy it ready made if you're in any doubt. You also get a guarantee there whereas if you build it yourself, your own handiwork is your only assurance of quality. FIVE PC gets some of the best games first. Case in point: Red Alert the brilliant Command and Conquer sequel which appears just as the first game hits the consoles! This is Prey a 3D accelerated pretender to Quake's crown. Gremlin's Realms of the Haunting another ace PC game! 88 "

Happy? 40 cclaim's Turok was one of the first third-party games to be announced for the Nintendo 64. Based on the comic book of the same name, it stars Turok (a dinosaur hunter) in a first-person 3D shooting game set in and around jungles, or at least to begin with. The design of the levels and the intelligence of the enemies means that it doesn't play the same as Doom or Quake, with much more emphasis on exploring, making the encounters with enemies all the more frightening. The game's been in development for a long time now, but is nearing completion in time for its March release date. Here's our first detailed look. TUROK DINOSAUR HUNTER DINOSAUR HUNTER ENTERTAINMENT ACCLAIM'S FANTASTIC TUROK FOR NINTENDO 64 TURON RUN! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! BIG GUNS! Since the first version of Turok we saw last year, the controls have changed slightly. The four yellow C-Buttons move Turok forwards and backwards, as well as making him sidestep left and right, while the 3D Stick controls turning and looking up or down. The Z-Trigger is the fire button, and the R Shift makes Turok jump. The A and B buttons cycle through the selection of weapons, and L Shift brings up the overlayed map. 3D first-person shooting games like Turok are getting more and more amazing selections of weapons each time, but none so far have been anywhere near as impressive as this! Those available range from the knife (which can be used even while swimming), through standard weapons and grenade launchers, to some of the most spectacular mega-guns ever! When fired, this gun shakes and rumbles before firing a red glowing shot. The explosion when the shot hits something is enormous! 1121 Pressing any direction on the cross-key switches the game from walk mode to run mode. This little icon appears to show you which is selected. NEW GAMES TUROK THE MAN HUNTER! Shockwaves tear through the level and out of the screen, destroying everything in the way! The bow and arrow is a bit feeble! That's the exit. While Turok may be a dinosaur hunter, not all of his enemies are necessarily dinos. There are other hunters around the levels armed with guns, as well as many jungle natives and villagers. At the moment there are some big lizards, prehistoric fish, and Velociraptor-like running creatures. In the final version we're expecting all sorts of amazing dinos, including Brachiosaurs and maybe even a T-Rex! Eeek! These natives are magic men, and they launch flaming skulls and blue flame at you! They take lots of hits before going down, unless you're armed with one of the super weapons! 92 "


"computer video games NINTENDO 13 Some of the weapon effects are truly amazing! This gun takes out nearly everything in a massive explosion of blue! 700 CLEVER GIRL NOT SUITABLE FOR PERSONS UNDER 65 MILLION YEARS Some versions of Turok shown recently had green blobs of blood for all of the enemies, but that's now been changed to realistic-looking red. It's pretty violent now, and is likely to get an age warning sticker on the box when it's released, but we're sure that many of you will be very happy to see blood everywhere! There are also lots of gruesome ways for enemies to die as well, with some of them staggering and wriggling about before dying, and some having blood splatted up the walls. Yuck. All of the enemies in Turok have some good artificial intelligence programming, meaning that they don't just stand around being shot like some other games. For a start, it's easy to be caught by surprise when playing Turok, as the enemies appear in different locations each time you play the game. Some dinosaurs are frightened by some of the human hunters, and will attack others. It's also pretty funny to have a native armed with a staff run towards you, then skid to a halt and run away when he sees what weapon you're firing at him! TUROK ACCLAIM'S FANTASTIC TUROK FOR NINTENDO 641 NEW GAMES 1 Shoot enemies in the neck, and they grab the wound with their hand while blood squirts out! 119 Enemies regenerate after a few seconds to keep players moving. HOW TO CAPTURE A DINOSAUR Acclaim's expensive motion-capture studios have been put to good use for Turok, making everything in the game move very realistically. The human enemies all walk, run, attack and die smoothly to add to the overall effect of the game. It works very well, and is something not used properly in a 3D shooting game like this before, Some walls, like the one on the left, can be climbed! 93 "

STAR WARS PART V (and a 1/2) THE DASHING HERO STAR WARS: SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE The rugged hero of Shadows of the Empire is Dash Rendar, smuggler, mercenary and -perhaps not surprisingly old friend to Captain Han Solo. He plies his illicit trade across the galaxy in a modified Corellian freighter, The Outrider, with the aid of his droid co-pilot LEBO2D9 (Leebo). Rendar becomes unwittingly involved in Xizor's plot when he lands on Hoth to deliver supplies to the Rebels. He runs into Solo who invites him to fight alongside the Rebel forces in an imminent battle. Rendar, whose ego prevents him from ever turning down a challenge agrees and he is given a place in Commander Skywalker's Rogue Squadron. Little does Rendar realise that this chance meeting will cast him into the middle of a This is Dash Rendar. I have a supply shipment for Echo base. Transmitting clearance code now.. deadly plot which involves the a deadly conspiracy against the highest ranking agents of the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. THE ADVENTURE BEGINS... Sketches are used to relate the plot details between action stages. NEW GAMES The events in Shadows of the Empire take place shortly after the destruction of Emperor Palpatine's first Death Star. The Rebel Alliance's main force has taken refuge on the ice world of Hoth and Darth Vader is leading an Imperial Navy task force there to seek out the Rebel ring-leaders. One of the Rebels holds special interest for him. Vader knows that Commander Luke Skywalker is his long-lost son, and therefore strong with The Force. He wants Luke taken alive so that he can be turned to the Dark Side and possibly presented to the Emperor as a new protégé. But there is another plan afoot. Unknown to Luke and to Vader, Dark Prince Xizor, freight magnate and boss of the powerful Black Sun crime syndicate, is also looking for young Skywalker. Xizor has been working hard to insinuate himself into Emperor Palpatine's confidence and he is hoping to seize Vader's position as the Emperor's right hand. He is using his own vast resources to track down Luke and have him assassinated. Thus he will ruin Vader's plan and, he hopes, discredit him in the eyes of the Emperor. Then he can take his place at the Emperor's side. Fiendish indeed but it is one man's inescapable destiny to become embroiled in the scheme and put a stop to it... even if he has to die in the attempt! The story of Shadows of the Empire is told in four parts, which are further broken down into a total of ten game levels. The action in each level takes one of two basic forms. There are four 'space battle' sequences in which you are piloting some kind of vehicle or Dash's freighter, The Outrider. In these sections you get a 3D pilot's-eye-view of the action, or, if you find it makes the ship easier to control, you can opt for an external view point. These sections make ample use of the N64's ability to render complex, texturemapped, three-dimensional objects, and they all look impressively realistic. The remaining six levels are 3D exploration missions, reminiscent of games like Doom and, more especially, Dark Forces. Here you guide Dash through the dangerous interiors of starships and enemy bases, doing battle with unfriendly forces such as Imperial Storm Troopers and commandos. The enemy troops and your surroundings are also generated as three-dimensional models which look extraordinarily authentic.  "

"computer Video games PLAYERS GUIDE: STARGLADKOR ought Star Gladiator, but can't get any technical mastery out of the game? Don't worry! After last month's Street Fighter Zero 2 fiesta, Yas Hunter delves into his psyche to produce the ultimate player's guide for Capcom's 3D beat-n-slash'em up, Star Gladiator for you to feast over. CAPCOM STAR KEYS A = SQUARE BE TRIANGLE GEX K = CIRCLE * BACK TO THE BASICS PLASMA REVERSALS THE SPIN-AROUND SUCER A move that will be instantly familiar for you Michelle Chang users out there. If the hit is successful, the victim is spun around 180° exposing his back for you to enter any combo of your choice. There are two types of Plasma Reversals Plasma Reflect and Plasma Revenge. Plasma Reflect stops the incoming attack and 'stuns' the opponent for you to strike with the move of your choice. Plasma Revenge automatically slices the recipient in two one of the best ways to stop a Plasma Combo. LEHT STAR GLADIATOR PLAYERS GUIDE PLASMA REFLECT MOVEMENTS As this is a 3D game, it's vital that you use the space of the arena to the fullest. By pressing G and one of the three directions, your character will move in, out, or towards your opponent. PLASIAA REVENGE Want hidden characters? We've got them! Here's a lowdown on the secret fighters. CHARACTER SELECT BILSTEIN COM 00 Away B AAAA Sliding Kick Away B FREEPLAY The boss of the game is very similar to Akira as he tends to put all his power into an attack but suffers from huge recovery times. But with a little patience, Bilstein has the ability to win the round in a matter of seconds. If you fancy using Bilstein, enter the following command on the player select screen: Hold down SELECT. Place the cursor on Gore. Tap in G, K, G, K, A, A, A, B, B, B, G+K. All the secret fighters codes can only be used on the arcade mode but once the bosses are available, they can be used in any of the other modes.

To fight against him, finish the third stage with double zeros on the clock either on the 'Seconds' or the 'Hundredths of a Second counter. Or to use him, input the following on the player select screen: Hold down SELECT. Place the cursor on Hayato. Enter K, A, B, A, G, A, B, A, K, A, G+B.

USEFUL PLASMA COMBOS  AAAA * SPECIAL STAGE: SUPER BILSTEIN SPECIAL STAGE BILSTEIN STAGE 4 6: The following three stages are the toughest stages of the entire game! This is where you will have to actually think about the fight at hand and one of the best tactics to use here is to start of with a Plasma Reflect. Choose the Plasma Reflect that is relevant with your opponent's most widely used strikes (i.e Hayato & Gerelt use A slashes, June & Gamof use B slashes). Finish the game under 6 minutes and prepare yourself for Super Bilstein! Like Dural in the VF games, Super Bilstein is classed as a Bonus Stage it doesn't affect the outcome of the game whether you beat him or not, as you've already finished the game. But boy is he tough! He has almost the identical repertoire as original Bilstein, but his reach is considerably longer and he has a teleportation move which he has a nasty tendency of using every time you use your weapon. AND he can't be knocked out of the ring!! Impossible?! Not quite. He suffers the same flaws as the original Bilstein. STAGE 7 9: Dash to the edge of the arena, hold your guard and watch in utter shock as the CPU fighters jump off the ring without even attacking! FREEPLAY CAMAS Blood Bilstein WHAT? FINISH THE GAME INUNDER 6 MINUTES?! The key to finishing the game before 6 minutes are up is as follows: STAGE 1-3: As soon as the round has begun, attack with a Plasma Final as the opponent will hardly block. With some characters, it's possible to knock out the CPU fighter in less than 3 seconds! "
